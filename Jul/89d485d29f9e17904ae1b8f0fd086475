South Africa Under-23 coach David Notoane will use the friendly matches against local sides as a barometer for his side ahead of the Olympics. The team is currently in the camp, which is based in Mpumalanga, preparing for the games. They were scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia for two international friendly matches ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games scheduled to take place from 22 July – 8 August 2021. However, the trip had to be cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Notoane then opted for a local camp as Plan B. “So far we are getting everything on track,” said Notoane. “We are excited to have our preparations going. The players who were on isolation after testing positive for the Covid-19 are back with the team now, they have joined us. `we have a local friendly match coming up and that will give us a good measure of the match conditioning and physical readiness.” Notoane will announce his final squad for the Olympics on Saturday. The squad has been submitted to SASCOC for preview and announcement. Mzansi, who were drawn in Group A for the tournament, will play against Japan, Mexico, and France. According to the draw, Japan will take on SA in the opening match. Egypt and Ivory Coast are other African countries that qualified for the tournament, and they were drawn in Group C and D, respectively.
