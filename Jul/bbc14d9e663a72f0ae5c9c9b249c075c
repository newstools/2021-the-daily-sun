PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa does not have to reveal who were his funders ahead of the 2017 presidential race. The High Court in Pretoria dismissed the case brought by the Economic Freedom Fighters to have the bank statements of the CR17 campaign made public yesterday. The court did not give reasons for its decision. The EFF relied on Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s now invalidated report on the CR17 campaign finances when it approached the court to force the disclosure of the statements. The party was ordered to pay costs. The Constitutional Court found earlier this month that both the Constitution and the Public Protector Act don’t empower Mkhwebane to investigate the private affairs of political parties. The EFF had asked the court to lift a seal on the information that was placed by deputy judge president Aubrey Ledwaba. It argued that there was no reason to hide information. The EFF said this could lead to politicians using public office to further the agendas of benefactors.
