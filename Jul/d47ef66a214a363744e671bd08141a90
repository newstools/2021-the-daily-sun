MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach, Rhulani Mokwena, has confirmed that the club has started preparations for the upcoming 2021-22 season. Sundowns will aim to continue with their domination in the domestic league and continue doing well in Africa, according to Mokwena. "We started on the 5th and 6th July with players going through comprehensive medical assessments. This included the functioning of their systems other than the physiological functioning of the body,” he told the club’s official site. "We had to check the functioning of their heart, as this is something that can be compromised due to the pandemic.” Sundowns have already confirmed four signings, Pavol Safranko, Devine Lunga, Neo Maema and Grant Kekana. Mokwena said the induction of new players had taken place over the last week. The new players will be fully integrated into the club's first team practices and culture over the next weeks. He stated: "We try and incorporate them into the winning mentality and culture of the club. They will be aware of the detail behind the project. "We audited the level from a technical perspective of where we are and where we want to be. This has been done via presentations. The players have been placed in groups and have presented to the team. At Sundowns, we depend a lot on video analysis to supplement the work we do on the training pitch. We do a lot of tactical and technical work to prepare ourselves." The Premier Soccer League (PSL) is yet to announce when the new season will start. However, Downs will face Kaizer Chiefs in the early stages of the campaign in an MTN8 clash after they finished at the top of the log while Amakhosi secured a last-eight finish on the last day when they finished in the eighth position.
