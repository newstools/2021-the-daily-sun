THE Gauteng Education Department is concerned that almost 10 000 teachers have refused to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Education activist Hendrick Makaneta has slammed those who refused vaccination, saying they were influenced by fake news on social media. “Teachers who refuse to take the vaccine are a danger, not only to their colleagues and pupils, but also themselves and their own families,” he said. “It’s disappointing that even educated people believe fake news. “We cannot allow unvaccinated teachers to put the lives of pupils at risk.” Makaneta urged the government to find a way to deal with teachers who refused to be vaccinated. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he was extremely worried that 9 113 teachers and support staff had refused the jab. “However, the vaccination is voluntary. The World Health Organisation encourages people at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19, such as healthcare providers, teachers and the elderly, to take the life-saving jab to reduce the risk of developing illness,” said the MEC.

Lesufi said on 23 June, the basic education department announced the start of the massive education sector vaccine roll-out. “At the moment, 53 154 teachers and support staff, out of 124 934 personnel, have been vaccinated at 56 sites across the province,” he said. “The number is expected to increase next week as the delays in capturing teachers and support staff from SGBs and independent schools has been resolved.” Lesufi said teachers who didn’t want to be vaccinated were posing a risk to the government’s efforts to normalise schooling. He said key partners in the education sector, such as unions and SGBs, were supporting the programme as they were aware of the problems the virus was causing. “We urge those who are refusing the vaccine to come forward and take this vaccine, which millions across the world are seeking,” said Lesufi.
