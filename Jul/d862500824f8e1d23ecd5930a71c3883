VUSI Mtembu makes a living selling traditional aluminium pots he manufactures with his wife. The 45-year-old from Winterveld, Tshwane, said he sold a variety of sizes of light-weight pots at affordable prices. “Because of job scarcity, I decided to make pots so I can support my family.” The father of three said he learnt the skill from a friend in 2006. “I fell in love with it and decided to do it myself. I use aluminium from old gearboxes, engine tops and pistons, which I buy from scrapyards,” he said. Vusi told the SunTeam that he was able to buy a Nissan 1400 in 2016 so he could travel and display his pots. He has also employed four people. Vusi’s partner, Lindiwe Mabaso, (42) said: “We love making pots, and we’re creating jobs for other people. “Our pots cook delicious food.” Vusi said he sold his pots at Denlyn Shopping Centre in Mamelodi West on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays and at Pienaarspoort Station on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. The prices start from R300 for a small pot, going up to R2 800 for the bigger pots. He even sells pots on an instalment basis of four months. The pots have a two-year guarantee. Vusi said his three-legged pots were only meant to be used over wood fires, but he also made others for coal and electricity. Customer Margaret Ngwenya (56) said: “The pots are beautiful and strong. “I will get a new one at the end of the month.” Margaret said the pots were great for cooking for a big family or events.
