A 55-year-old man was stabbed to death allegedly by his neighbours. It apparently happened after an argument broke out between them over parking a bicycle outside his home in Panchkula in Haryana, India on 8 July. According to Timesnownews.com, the man had parked his bicycle outside his house. And since the lane was narrow, less space was left for his neighbourâ€™s two-wheeler to pass. This then reportedly led to a heated argument between the neighbours. According to a report, one of the neighbours reportedly got angry and picked up a bicycle and threw it at the other neighbour. The angry neighbour then left the spot and returned along with his two sons, carrying a knife, rods, and sticks with them. He then stabbed the neighbour in the chest, killing him on the spot.
