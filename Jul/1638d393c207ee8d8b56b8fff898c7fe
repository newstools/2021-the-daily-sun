BAFANA Bafana are Cosafa Cup champions. They defeated a dogged Senegal outfit 5-4 on penalties in the final played at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium yesterday. Bafana captain and goalkeeper Veli Mothwa was the hero for his side as he saved one penalty and scored one too. This was Bafana’s fifth title. And they had to hurdle over s few obstacles on their way to clinching the title. The biggest issue they battled with was Covid-19 as it wreaked havoc on the team. They had to release some players before the start of the tournament after they tested positive for the deadly virus. Bafana also lost head coach Helman Mkhalele and goalkeeper coach Lucky Shiburi who had to be isolated for the better part of the tournament. Morena Ramoreboli, however, proved to be equal to the task as he took the reins to lead Bafana to the final. They won five of their six matches leading up to the final and boasted a flawless defensive record. They scored nine goals and did not concede even a single goal on their way to the final. Ramoreboli’s side brushed Mozambique aside 3-0 in the semi-finals for a spot in the final. Meanwhile, Senegal beat Eswatini in their semi-final on penalties after it ended in a 2-2 in regulation time. The guest nation went all the way to the final in what was their debut campaign in the Cosafa Cup. The Teranga Lions finished top of their group with their youngsters catching the eye in the tournament. And they gave Bafana a good run for their money but fell short in the end.
