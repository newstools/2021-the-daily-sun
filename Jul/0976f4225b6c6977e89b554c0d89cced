JAZZ artist Musa Manzini is fighting for his life in hospital. The guitar player is being treated at Helen Joseph Hospital in Joburg and needs money for surgery as he has a brain tumour. For this reason, organisations and artists such as Madala Kunene and Zamo Mbutho have been trying to raise funds. They have been asking for donations on Facebook since Tuesday, 29 June. Jazz pianist Nduduzo Makhathini said: “I was greatly influenced by Musa’s work and I’m requesting assistance to raise funds for his next surgery.” Radio presenter Kgomotso “KG” Moeketsi also appealed for donations. ASLO  READ | SKEEM SAAM FANS FUMING Musa’s former manager and family spokesman, Mark Roth, told Daily Sun he’d already survived four operations to remove tumours. He said at least R200 000 was needed this time around. “We’ve tried to get money from music organisations and we thought he might be owed royalties but we haven’t had luck. So far, Samro has paid about R30 000 and we are truly grateful for that. “Unfortunately, that amount will not be enough to cover his medical bills. “Musa was admitted to Sandton Medi-Clinic on 29 June but due to Covid-19, he hasn’t worked in almost two years and has no money. All the savings in his medical aid fund have been exhausted. He was then transferred to Helen Joseph.” Mark said the private hospital was ready to operate but there was no money for the procedure. “Right now, he’s lying there in excruciating pain. He has to wait until 12 July for his first assessment. We are appealing to the public, the government and everyone out there to help us raise money for his surgery.”
