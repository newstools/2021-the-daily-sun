Lesotho’s deadliest striker in their COSAFA Cup history Motebang Sera has Bafana Bafana in his sights. The Bloemfontein Celtic forward is currently on six Cosafa Cup goals – one more than former Likuena captain Tlali Maile. Sera is equal on six career goals in the competition with Deon Hotto of Namibia and Malawi’s Gabadihno Mhango, who also play their football in Mzansi. Sera will be looking to improve his record when he leads the line for Likuena against Bafana at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday. “It’s really an honour to learn that I’m Lesotho’s top goalscorer in the COSAFA Cup,” Sera said. “I have also learned that I have scored in five tournaments consecutively.“It’s really a great thing and I’m very humbled and honoured with those achievements. All this wouldn’t be possible without the assistance of my teammates and the technical team. “I don’t play for individual glory, but I always want to score and help my country win in every match we play. I will keep working hard and grateful for the opportunity to serve my country. “Coming to the game with Bafana Bafana, we have been preparing for the game and it’s a must-win for us. We really need to win this one and we have put our minds to it because anything can still happen in our group.”
