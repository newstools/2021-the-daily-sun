Bafana Bafana caretaker coach Morena Ramoreboli was delighted with back-to-back wins that put his side in a strong position in Group A at the COSAFA Cup. South Africa head their pool after a victory on Tuesday against Botswana was followed by another by the same scoreline against Eswatini on Thursday thanks to a lone goal from Thabang Sibanyoni. "It was another difficult game, I have been saying to them [the players] that when you play countries in the SADC [Southern Africa] region they want to beat us because they know scouts are here, and they might earn some contracts,” Ramoreboli said. "They come fighting with everything, but I am proud of the character and commitment that we saw from the boys. I still believe we will be better as the tournament progresses. I am excited to work with such a wonderful group. "We knew they will be throwing a lot of high balls into our box and we had to deal with that. We did that well, and it was also a bonus for us when they got a red card [for Felix Badenhorst] because it allowed us to change the game and play more with a 4-4-2. "This is one tournament where you know it will be difficult to get the three points through open play. Sometimes you need to steal it through a substitution because the game-plan might have to change.” Bafana have a rest and are next in action against Lesotho on Tuesday, before they face Zambia in a potentially crucial clash the very next day. "In the next match we should have everybody [fit], we have tried to get four more players into the squad and when we play Lesotho we will have all our players ready.” -SuperSport
