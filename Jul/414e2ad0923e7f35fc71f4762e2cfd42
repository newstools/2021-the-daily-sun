MUSICIAN Loyiso Bala believes in the saying “it takes a village to raise a child”. He said he felt blessed to have many people in his life who made him the man he is today. He said this became evident when his cousin, Lwando Bantom, took him under his wing after his father passed away. He said although Lwando worked as a petrol attendant, he did everything he could to put food on the table.Loyiso was reflecting on positive male influences that went beyond Father’s Day. He also reflected on how Lwando stepped in and played a father figure role at the age of 19. He said Lwando’s presence in his life influenced how he views fatherhood. “I knew my father loved me. I had a few formative years with him and others stepped in when he died and it was through people such as Lwando that I felt the love of a father,” said Loyiso. “Lwando showed me what I would model fatherhood on. He took care of me and my brother Zwai, who is four years older than me,” said Loyiso.

He sent money home for the funeral and took care of me at a young age,” he said. He said Zwai became his role model for building a career and the desire to achieve his dreams. “In terms of looking at a family man and how to raise children, there was Dr Zolile Mlisana. “I’ve been blessed. God has blessed me with people who lifted me so I can pay it forward and have the same kind of impact on my children,” he said.
