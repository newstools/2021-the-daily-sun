But his opinions don’t always go down well with local football fans, seen as he came under fire for his comment on Bafana Bafana this week. What a beautiful game!!! Wow!!!! Bafana bafana could never but asikho lapho!!! #EURO2020  Watching a Euro 2020 match between France and Switzerland, Cassper couldn’t help but draw comparison with Bafana, cracking a joke about the underperforming national team. “What a beautiful game! Wow! Bafana Bafana could never but asikho lapho,” he tweeted. But it seems his tweet wasn’t well received, judging by the mixed reaction from Twitterville. “U would be crying when we watch Kendrick Lamar or Drake spitting elite bards and we start saying Cassper Nyovest would never...Dont do that bla...” was a reply from Sephiri Mosothoane. U would be crying when we watch Kendrick Lamar or Drake spitting elite bards and we start saying Cassper Nyovest would never...Dont do that bla...  Cassper hit back: “True, but that doesn't stop yall from doing it does it? You just did it right now so lenna leave me alone sephiri!” True, but that doesn't stop yall from doing it does it ?
