AS lockdown regulations continue to be enforced around the world, people are stuck with boredom and end up doing strange things. A 38-year-old man from Bangkok in Thailand was admitted to hospital on Friday, 16 July, after a padlock was stuck around his penis. According to news.com.au, the man clamped his 4-5 with a metal device two weeks ago but lost the key and his manhood started to swell. The publication reported that the man failed to remove the small lock and left it on his 4-5 for more than 14 days until it became infected. ALSO READ: TIPS TO WASH 4-5 PROPERLY! The man’s mother was reportedly embarrassed and told the health workers that he was bored when he locked his 4-5. “My son is a private person and he doesn’t have a girlfriend. He has been staying at home a lot during the pandemic because he is worried about going out,” she said. A rescue officer, Thongchai Donson, said the injury was worse than they expected. “If the padlock had stayed on for any longer, the infection could have been so bad that his penis would have started to rot and get gangrene (death of body tissue due to a lack of blood flow),” Donson told the publication.
