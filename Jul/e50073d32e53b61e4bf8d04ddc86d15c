We’ve had enough of Jacob Zuma, his family and their supporters. They seem to think he’s South Africa’s king and is untouchable. Who do they think they are? We’re sick and tired of them. The less said about the so-called RET and MKMVA groups, the better. I regret having voted for ANC during Zuma’s era. I wasted my vote. Zuma is not a king and he never was. His family must stop this nonsense of undermining the laws of Mzansi. He committed a crime and must go to jail. Soshanguve
