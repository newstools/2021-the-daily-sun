SOCIAL grant beneficiaries from remote areas in Limpopo are now forced to travel long distances to withdraw their grants. This after Sassa closed its pay points, saying it was not safe for cash-in-transit vehicles to operate under the current threat of looting and destruction of property. Zwannda Kutama, Limpopo Sassa spokesman, said there would be no payments at pay points as per schedule due to ongoing protests in different parts of the country. “It is acknowledged that the riots have not spread to Limpopo. However, this is a preventative measure taken by the security company responsible for transporting cash to pay points. “Beneficiaries are advised to use alternative means to access their money, such as ATMs and merchant stores. “Sassa apologises to all social beneficiaries for the inconvenience. It is an unfortunate situation,” he said. “However, necessary steps should be taken to avoid any damage and losses as well as to protect lives.” But the EFF in Limpopo had a different view. The party said this was a punishment for local people as no one in the province had participated in the public unrest. Party leader Jossey Buthane said there was no reasonable excuse to suspend the grants. He said this would further deepen poverty in the province, and the party rejected the irrational decision with the contempt it deserved as it was aimed to shutdown poor families and their livelihoods. “Recipients of social grants have no other means of income, and most of them feed their families with the grant. The suspension of the social grants will further lead to social ills like crime. “We want an assurance from Sassa that no beneficiary will be deprived of their benefits as hunger has no calender date,” said Buthane. “The decision to suspend payments indicates that government is not moved by the plight of the poor in this country. “It is clear that government is trying to provoke people of this peaceful province.”
