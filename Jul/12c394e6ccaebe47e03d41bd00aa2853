SINGER Skolopad is officially a makoti. And although she’s known for wearing skimpy outfits or no clothes at all, she assured her fans nothing would change. Skolopad, whose real name is Nonhlanhla Qwabe, tied the knot in Qwaqwa, Free State on Saturday, 3 July. She and her new husband were in an on-and-off relationship before making it official. She said her husband didn’t like the limelight and worked behind the scenes in the music industry. “He’s a very private person and doesn’t like fame and all the pressures that come with it. “I like to keep our relationship private,” she said. She said her husband would not change her. “Skolopad will always be Skolopad. I was in an accident and some people thought I would be ashamed of the scars and cover up, but I embraced the scars and wore revealing clothes,” she said. She said only death would stop her from wearing revealing clothes. “I’m a creative and my body is a canvas. No marriage, haters or society standards will ever stop me from celebrating my body and being body positive to inspire my fans,” she said. Skolopad said her wedding was small and intimate. “I’m a professional nurse and know how devastating Covid-19 is, so I made sure all restrictions were followed. “My wedding was beautiful. I was surrounded by love and positivity,” said Skolopad. She said fans could look forward to more creativity from her. “Marriage is another chapter and a new experience. I’m sure it will inspire me and I will serve my fans what they expect from me, more music and some flesh.”
