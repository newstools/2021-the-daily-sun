AS riots continue in some parts of Mzansi, truck drivers bound for Gauteng are grounded in Polokwane, Limpopo, as companies fear possible violent attacks. This comes after numerous trucks were looted and torched, while some roads have been blockaded in Gauteng and KZN since last week. Truck driver Retshidisitswe Ntsomotho (42) of Olbro Logistics arrived in Polokwane on Monday, 12 July. He said rushing back to Joburg would be a risk, so his company decided he should rest in Polokwane for sometime until the situation was calm. He told Daily Sun one of their trucks were set alight in Kranskop Toll Plaza in KZN and they were trying to avoid areas with riots. “I was also supposed to go to Durban on Sunday, but my controller changed my trip to Polokwane as they were warned it’s unsafe. “I really applaud Limpopo communities. I drove from Joburg to here and never saw any protest on the N1 or any attempts. It’s so safe here. I wish other communities learnt something from Limpopians,” said Retshidisitswe. Another trucker said he was scared as trucks carrying food were targeted. “It’s so hard for us because we lose our phones and bank cards when these people attack us. Our company always promise us they will protect us if anything happens on the road, but such promises have never been fulfilled.” Meanwhile, a Limpopo-based civil rights organisation called on communities to help law enforcement agencies stop the looting of shops. Conty Lebepe of Conlef Foundation said it was time for people to stand together to defend and protect jobs, infrastructure and the economy. “We call on residents to remain vigilant against calls made by some people who seem to want to score political points during this unrest. Our duty is to help soldiers in any form that can bring stability and peace in our country. Let’s identify the looters in our communities and allow the arm of the law to take its course,” said Lebepe.
