IT looks like Prophet Mafa Tsoane’s marriage is on the rocks. This after videos, taken by his angry wife Prophetess Jennifer Tsoane, went viral on social media, claiming he was negotiating his lobola in her house. But the founder of Liberation Chapel Ministries in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said he was negotiating lobola for his sister. “The problem is that my wife was misinformed that I’m getting married, and decided to come although we tried to engage with her the day before,” he said. “How do I negotiate my lobola in my own house? “According to our tradition, you cannot negotiate such where you live. I was supposed to go to the house of the woman I’m getting married to.” On the issue of divorce, Tsoane, who is known as “One Touch from God is Enough”, said they were trying to resolve it. “I’m a man of God and don’t believe in divorce. I believe in resolving the matter. I still love my wife. I don’t have any other relationship,” he told Daily Sun, adding thatthey had been married for about 10 years. Tsoane said the videos affected him negatively. “This is the first time I trended in that way. I tried by all means to behave like a man of God to avoid such nonsense. “I’m very embarrassed. My lawyer spoke to her to delete the videos, but she had already sent them to her close friends, who posted them on social media,” he said. However, his wife said she was not informed about the lobola negotiations and was told to leave the premises. “My husband left the house in 2018. I want a divorce. I want to apologise to all South Africans. He’s a man of God. “That’s all I can say and nothing else,” she said. She added that her lawyers would call the SunTeam soon, but no call was received at the time of going to print.
