SUNDAY, 18 July marks Tata Nelson Mandela’s birthday. He would have been 103 years old this year had he lived. Now that the gogos and madalas who had lived as neighbours with Mandela have died over the years, it is now up to their grandchildren and great grandkids to maintain the history and legacy of the former statesman. With a lot of information received from their grandparents and some of the moments experienced by the youth, Qiniso Mbuyisa (37) who lived next door to Mandela, shared his encounter. Speaking to Daily Sun outside his family home in Vilakazi Street in Orlando West, Qiniso said he will never forget some moments. He said he remembered that the fence between their houses had a hole. “We used the hole to play with the Mandela children. I remember sometimes seeing comrades entering my yard and going into the Mandela house.” With Mama Winnie being banned from leaving her home, Qiniso said he recalled how she climbed through the hole to attend meetings.  “People spoke of Mama Winnie being seen outside although her house was monitored 24 hours a day, but I used to see her leave the house through the hole,” he said. Qiniso told the SunTeam about that one day he would never forget.“It was the day Mandela was expected to be released from prison. “It was like a festival. We sat on the precast wall and gathered among dozens of other residents to see him. It was drizzling and when he arrived, people were so happy and celebrated his release,” he said. Another child of Mandela’s neighbours, Nonhlanhla Manqele (61), said although they were young, she could remember Mandela going house to house.  “The image of Mandela shaking the hands of our parents is what I’ll always remember of the day he came out,” said Nonhlanhla. “My dad used to work closely with him and he will always tell us the stories of the kind of man he was. I knew him as a relaxed and down to earth person who always stood for what was right.”
