The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) condemned the "lawlessness" during the recent looting and unrest - and called on South Africa to emulate the late Nelson Mandela by upholding the law. "In the wake of widespread violence, resulting in looting and wanton destruction, the words of Nelson Mandela resonate deeply at this moment: 'It is easy to break down and destroy. The heroes are those who make peace and build'. "All people within South Africa should consider that we are all called upon to at this dark moment to show leadership wherever we find ourselves," the commission said in a statement. With the commemoration of Mandela Day on Sunday, South Africans needed to assess what had gone wrong, the commission added. "As the commission, we shall be re-looking at our priorities and shall be engaged in self-reflection. While we have, in the midst of the violence and general anarchy, engaged continuously with various stakeholders, including leaders of political parties and religious bodies, we shall continue to hold engagements with a broad sector in society. "The commission condemns the lawlessness and violence that resulted in the loss of lives and livelihoods, and urges adult persons to set an example for the young in our midst, so that our failures today are not inflicted on our country tomorrow." Mandela Day is observed annually on 18 July, the birthday of the late statesman and struggle stalwart. It is also recognised by the United Nations as the Nelson Mandela International Day.
