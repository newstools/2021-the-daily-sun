EDWARD “Magents” Motale can’t sleep well knowing that some elderly people go to bed hungry. That’s why the former Orlando Pirates defender donated groceries to the elderly around his community of Mamelodi West, Tshwane. The 1995 CAF Champions League winner and former Bafana Bafana player donated groceries, T-shirts and masks to 28 gogos and two madalas. “This is the right thing to do, and I’m doing it out of love and from my own pocket. “Whenever I get money, I make an effort towards my community,” he said. Magents has been donating for the past four years through the Edward Motale Foundation. He has also adopted the Mamelodi football team Golden Legends, that has 25 players between the ages of 35 and 50. He has been supplying them with kit and balls for the past six years, helping them to train and teaching them the importance of being healthy. “I do these initiatives out of love, and I plan to continue doing so,” he said. Gogo Hellen Motale (73) said: “This is like Christmas for me. I will cook a good meal. This came at the right time as I had run out of food.” Gogo Dikeledi Kgomo (67) said she will enjoy the viennas and polony. “I was starving. The food has saved me from hunger.” Residents said Covid-19 had made their lives harder, so such donations gave them hope. Magents is appealing to donors to help him so he can donate groceries to the elderly more regularly.
