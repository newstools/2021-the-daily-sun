Mamelodi Sundowns striker, Kermit Erasmus, cannot wait to get onto the field of play and quench his thirst of action. He was reflecting on the team’s return to the training ground at the University of Pretoria where the team are completing a two-week camp, where they had a number of medical and physical assessments as well as tactical and technical training sessions. Through his official website, Erasmus shared his excitement about the prospects that lie ahead. He said: “It’s always good to be hungry as an individual, but not only for myself but also for the team as well as for us to win things and to contribute again. We want to try to build on last season and to try to add more to the cabinet in terms of silverware.” He added that he is excited and I cannot wait. "It’s been a good start to pre-season and we are all looking forward to (the new season),” he said.
