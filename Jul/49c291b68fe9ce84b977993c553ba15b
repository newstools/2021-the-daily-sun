ACTIONSA has called on President for Cyril Ramaphosa to declare a state of emergency in eThekwini, KZN. This comes amid ongoing lootings and violent attacks in the province. The leader of the party, Herman Mashaba, said this would be done to restore peace, law and safety of all residents. He said this was a necessary tool to help the community of Phoenix where there are media reports about a war zone with dead bodies, armed community militia and the torching of cars in streets. “Declaring a state of emergency in eThekwini is a drastic, but necessary, step to fight the runaway criminality in that area while avoiding a wholesale limitation of residents’ rights across KZN.

Mashaba also called on the president to ensure that law enforcement agencies are fully empowered by: “As ActionSA, we continue our call to all sectors of society to exercise calm and respect for our rule of law. We equally call on all residents to not take the law into their own hands. Vigilantism will only serve to further undermine the rule of law. That said, Ramaphosa, his cabinet and law enforcement agencies must also come to the party,” Mashaba said.
