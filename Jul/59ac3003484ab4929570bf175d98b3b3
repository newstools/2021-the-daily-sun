THERE was no sign of former president Jacob Zuma’s supporters outside Estcourt Correctional Services or the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Monday, 19 July. Unlike his previous court appearances, there was no sign of supporters wearing ANC regalia or members of the disbanded MKMVA singing songs. Instead, there was a heavy police presence outside Pietermarizburg High Court and heavily armed soldiers were guarding the area. Zuma and French arms company Thales face charges of corruption, racketeering and money laundering linked to the Arms Deal controversy. Zuma’s court hearing was held via Microsoft Teams. He was linked from the Estcourt Correctional Centre, where he is being held after being found guilty of contempt by the Constitutional Court. A few hours after police and soldiers gathered outside the court, former #FeesMustFall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile turned up and started shouting: “uMsholozi akakhishwe ejele”, which means Msholozi must be released from prison. Khanyile said Zuma was an old man who should not have been arrested, especially during a pandemic. There were rumours that Zuma’s supporters would cause chaos in Estcourt. A voice note, circulated on social media, had called on people to gather outside the prison. But the SunTeam saw no protesters outside. The prison was guarded by prison wardens, and police later arrived with a water canon. Cops also set up roadblocks on roads leading to the prison.
