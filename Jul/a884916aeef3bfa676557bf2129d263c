MARITZBURG United new assistant coach Maahier Davids has described his return to the club as a great “feeling”. Davids’ return was confirmed on Tuesday along with the signings of Alfred Ndengane, Zukile Kewuti, Lifa Hlongwane and Rowan Human. Davids, who is the younger of Fadlu Davids, spent three years with Maritzburg between 2015 and 2018. He was the assistant coach of Middendorp when the former Kaizer Chiefs coach helped the club survive the relegation zone in the 2016 season before Germany left in November 2016. He then assisted his brother, Fadlu, when Maritzburg achieved their highest position in the PSL era, fourth, in the 2017-18 campaign, where they also lost the Nedbank Cup final at the hands of Free State Stars in Cape Town, the first final for Maritzburg in the PSL history. “It’s good to be back home,” reacted Davids, who has a UEFA A License just like his brother Fadlu. “I’m pleased to see that the club has taken steps forward in terms of the progress of the infrastructure here. I’m looking forward to getting stuck in.” This will be the fourth time Maahier works with Middendorp. In three stints (two with Maritzburg and Ea Lia Koto), they also worked together at Ethiopian outfit St George, before Germany return to the country last November when the club needed salvation. Davids’ return will raise question marks about the future of Delron Buckley, who joined the club as the assistant coach at the beginning of last season when Eric Tinkler was in charge. It is highly unlikely Maritzburg will have two qualified assistants as they are struggling to cope financially. Maritzburg recently parted ways with Kwanda Mngonyama, Thabiso Kutumela, Bandile Shandu, Mxolisi Kunene, Bongani Mpandle, Daniel Morgan, Dusan Stevic Jethren Barr. Malebogo Modise, Tebogo Tlolane, Keletso Sifama returned to their clubs –Mamelodi Sundowns, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs respectively.
