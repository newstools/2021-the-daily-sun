SOME places in the human body are more sensitive than others. And, according to The Times of India, there are certain places in a woman’s body that one should not touch during sex. According to the magazine, these are some of those body parts one shouldn’t tamper with during lovemaking: 1. Head of clitoris We know the clitoris is a super-sensitive zone and has a lot of nerve endings, but stimulating the head of clitoris vigorously can actually turn out to be an intense and painful experience for her. 2. Feet According to a Johns Hopkins University study, wearing socks in bed increases the chances of having an orgasm. This applies to men as well. Women need to be completely relaxed to climax, and cold feet can be an uncomfortable distraction.
