AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has not reported back to the club’s pre-season training. McCarthy is still in Edinburgh, Scotland and will only return to Durban on Sunday. The reasons were not given by the club on why he has been held back while the team started their pre-season training on 7 July. McCarthy transformed Usuthu from relegation candidates to title contenders last season, where they finished second in the DStv Premiership, their highest position in the club’s history in the PSL era. They will feature either in the Caf Champions League or the Caf Confederation Cup, depending on whether Kaizer Chiefs beat Egyptian giants Al Ahly in the Caf Champions League final in Morocco tomorrow (9pm). The Premiership runners up get an automatic place in the Champions League, but the Confederation of Africa Football (Caf) rules state that only two teams per country can compete in the Champions League. So if Amakhosi beat Ahly, they will qualify as defending champions and AmaZulu could compete in the Confederation Cup. The former Orlando Pirates striker’s absence has seen Usuthu take things slowly in the transfer market. So far they have signed Keagan Buchanan and Mxolisi Kunene from Maritzburg United. In McCarthy’s absence, the players are training under assistant coaches Vasili Manousakis, Siyabonga Nomvethe and Moeneeb Josephs. The trio have kept McCarthy informed about the pre-season training. “My role is to keep the head coach informed on a daily basis. We touch base every evening with him in Scotland,” Manousakis said.
