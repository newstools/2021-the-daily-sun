LET’S face
it, a lot of electric car manufacturers have hit a miss with their design
language. Well,
that’s except for Tesla. And this is not because it’s owned by Mzansi-born Elon
Musk, but because it actually looks good. Chinese
carmaker Chery has released a small electric vehicle that looks a lot like the
Smart Fortwo. The small
car is reportedly popular in China, as its sales exceeded 200 000 in four
years, and ranks number one in accumulative sales in the same price range. Chery’s new
EQ1 is subjected to a comprehensive upgrade in respect of endurance,
intelligence, safety, efficiency and appearance with improved strength, bound
to be popular in the market again. With
intelligence becoming the inevitable trend of travel in the future, the new EQ1
has been upgraded intelligently, is more intimate and can better “understand”
you. It now has
one-button automatic parking and remote control, remote air conditioning
starting and charging appointment. It is also
equipped with a 10-inch high-definition LCD screen with a sense of technology,
AI intelligent voice interaction to free up hands and mobile wireless charging
as well as Baidu Car-Life+4GWi-Fi.
