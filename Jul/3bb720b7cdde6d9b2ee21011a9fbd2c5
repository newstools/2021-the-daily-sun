BAFANA Bafana have reached the Cosafa
Cup final for the first time since 2016. This comes after beating Mozambique 3-0 in the
semi final at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Friday afternoon. Njabulo Ngcobo, Yusuf Maart and Victor Letsoalo (penalty) were all on the scoresheet to set a date with guest nation Senegal. For Letsoalo, it was his fourth goal
in the competition, meaning he’s top scorer in this competition in just three
appearances having arrived late. The Lions of Teranga reached the
final after they edged eSwatini 2-0 on penalty shoot outs after the game ended
2-2 in the regulation time in the earlier semis. The game saw caretaker coach Morena
Ramoreboli continuing in charge for Bafana, despite Helman Mkhalele having
recovered from Covid-19. What might be amusing stats for
Bafana technical team is that they are yet to concede a goal in this tournament
on their way to reach the final on Sunday. They first beat Botswana 1-0 in what
was the first game of the tournament in the group stages, then followed that up
with another 1-0 win over eSwatini. Soon goals flowed for Bafana as they
thumped Lesotho 4-0 with Letsoalo historically grabbing a hat-trick. Knowing that the job was done, Bafana
completed the group stages with a goalless draw against Zambia. Interestingly, every time Bafana have
reached the Cosafa final they win it, as they did in 2002, 2007, 2008 and 2016. But they will be tested against the
Senegalese side, who have physically big boys, unlike Mozambique who gave a
little trouble to the South Africans. To some up how poor they were, the Mambas
didn’t have a shot at goal in the first half. This semi final between the two was
the repeat of the 2008 Cosafa Cup final in which Bafana claimed a 2-1 success
to lift the trophy.
