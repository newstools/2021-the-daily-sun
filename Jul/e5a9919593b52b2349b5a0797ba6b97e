MEDIA personality Somizi Mhlongo has urged people to be safe and try not to contract Covid-19. In a video he posted on Instagram on Tuesday 6 July, Somizi said he isn’t okay because he is anxious and overly paranoid about contracting the deadly virus. Somizi pleaded with people to stay safe because Covid-19 numbers were going up. He said people should be grateful they get a chance to wake up. “Guys, I’m not okay. Anxiety is going to be the death of us. I’m not okay. I’m overly paranoid and there are new variants of viruses every single day so I’m just pleading with everyone who has a chance to listen to this, please let’s be safe,” he said. “Let’s appreciate the chance that we have to see another day by being thankful to the Lord, thankful to the power above that we’ve been given another chance and we are still alive. But let’s help the Creator as well and look after ourselves,” he said.

And I made sure I didn’t touch or see anyone. Someone asked me for a picture and I just walked away because you never know. These new variants are aggressive, so please guys,” he said. Somizi said he has lost seven people whom he knew personally to Covid-19 in the past week. “God, please be with us and forgive us. Let’s be overly paranoid, even visiting each other, let that stop. And I’ve been a culprit of that, but not anymore. In our heads, let’s go back to level 5 before we legally go back. I love you, please be safe, God bless you,” said Somizi.
