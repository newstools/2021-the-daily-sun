SWALLOWS FC  boss David Mogashoa hopes the government will speed up the vaccine process so that fans can return to stadiums to rally behind his team in the new PSL season. Mogashoa is concerned that the roll out of vaccine is going at a snail pace while people continue to lose their loved ones. The upcoming season will be the second without fans due to Covid-19 restrictions. Even though fans in Europe are now allowed to support their teams at venues, Mogashoa reckons it will take longer before Mzansi football fanatics enjoy the game at Stadiums again. Explained Mogashoa: “Our government vaccinate few people per day which is not good enough. Covid is serious cause it has killed a lot of people, I also lost people that I know due to this pandemic. We hope the government will speed up the roll out of vaccine to ensure our loved ones are safe before we can even consider having them in stadiums.”
