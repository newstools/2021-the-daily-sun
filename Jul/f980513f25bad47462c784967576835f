FORMER Kaizer Chiefs defender Morgan Gould has gone down memory lane and called back the past sharing a picture of some of the players that won two double triumphs including Premiership titles in 2013 and 2015 and a pictured showing fans a Love and Peace sign. Gould posted the pic showing Bernard Parker, Tsepo Masilela, Reneilwe Letsholonyane, Siphiwe Tshabalala and Siboniso Gaxa. Only Parker remains at Chiefs. Gould is at Sekhukhune United, while Masilela and Tshabalala are at AmaZulu. Letsholonyane and Gaxa have retired, with the former announcing his retirement a few days ago. However, this picture triggered fans to send in a flood of messages on social media, some saying they represented the club well during the 2012-13 and 2014-15 seasons where Chiefs won four trophies which included two double triumphs – the league title and Nedbank Cup in the 2012-13 season. In the 2014-15 season Chiefs won the league and MTN8. The 2014-15 season was the last time Amakhosi won a trophy. Parker, the Amakhosi skipper, hopes to end the current trophy drought when the Soweto giants play arguably the biggest match in their history, when they face Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly in the Caf Champions League final in Casablanca, Morocco next Saturday.
