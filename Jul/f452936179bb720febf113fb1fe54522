Covid-19 survivors should continue to inspire others with their testimonies. It’s essential to take heed and advice from those who suffered from Covid-19. I feel encouraged by reading their painful experiences in Daily Sun. People should follow Covid-19 safety rules and regulations if they want to survive the virus. Minimising exposure is challenging when you work on the front line. It’s important to share your experience. The lesson they learnt is that they can’t keep this a secret. I know people think you can’t tell anyone, but as soon as you test positive you need to tell people close to you and those you had contact with, so they can also get tested. Those who can must continue talking to people about their experience and sharing their stories. We need to talk to each other to break the stigma of Covid-19. Remember that you don’t have to keep this a secret. We have all learnt so much about Covid-19 over the past year, but the only way to continue to break the stigma around the virus is to talk to each other about our personal experiences.
