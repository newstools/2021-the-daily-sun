According to scientists, we are at the peak of the third wave of Covid-19. If the second and third waves are anything to go by, then the fourth wave will be knocking at our doorstep very soon.  When we celebrated the arrival of the first batch of vaccines in the country, little did we know that the roll-out would be the slowest. The infection levels get out of hand because the Covid-19 regulations have been applied inconsistently. Churches have been closed ever since the first lockdown, while taverns have stayed opened. Why can’t churches be opened while on-site drinking of alcohol is permitted? As much as there are alcoholics who get sick if they go without drinking booze, the church members’ spirituality also gets affected. Just as the sale of alcohol brings in huge income for the government, the movement of people going to church boosts the economy in many ways. People at churches are sober and can easily comply with the Covid-19 regulations far better than the tavern patrons. Also, it boggles the mind why a certain percentage of spectators are still not allowed into the stadiums. For as long as there is no equality on the stringent Covid-19 regulations and with a slow vaccine roll-out, here comes the fourth wave. - Letter by Matome Kubu, Arcadia
