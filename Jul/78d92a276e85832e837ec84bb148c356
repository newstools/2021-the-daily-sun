AS far as tug-of-war battles goes, local football has seen many over the decades. But none have been more intriguing like a fierce war for the services of Siphelele Mthembu between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. Both sides claimed they had a contract with Mthembu, and the matter ended up at the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber. Pirates had earlier registered Mthembu as their player after signing a contract with the former Maritzburg City Player.     The rivalry between the two sides intensified after Amakhosi lodged an appeal. But the League ruled that the contract between Pirates and Mthembu was valid.   But they would find their man six years later as Mthembu joined them from Platinum Stars.
