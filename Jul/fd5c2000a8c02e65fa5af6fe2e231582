There are a few things in the fashion world that stand the test of time. From the classic mum jeans, corduroy to flared trousers coupled with the sexiness of bike shorts, there are a handful of fashion brands that can boast to say that they’ve stood the test of such times. One such brand is the authentic and multigenerational brand Brentwood. Priding itself with heritageous qualities while carrying the aesthetic and story from one generation to the next, this gentlemanly brand still believes in empowering and bettering every generation, whilst leaving no man behind. The aesthetic story behind the prestigious brand is not only an important voice in South African fashion, but it’s an important voice in South African music and storytelling; embedding itself into the maskandi and scathamiya music genres.

Brentwood’s iconic ideology has been passed down from one generation to the next. An ideology that places great importance on being the leader of the pack and a gentleman among gentlemen. Brentwood clothes are cut from the finest cloth, just like the gentlemen who wear them. The 100% Italian wool trousers are made for the men who stand with confidence and pride in who they are, what positive changes they bring to the world and how they teach the next generation about the importance of their roots and staying true to themselves.
