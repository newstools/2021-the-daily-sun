THE
midnight shenanigans in Nkandla that unfolded on Wednesday, 7 July, before
former president Jacob Zuma handed himself over to Estcourt Correctional
Centre, reminds Mzansi of another day and night of high drama on 14 February,
2018. Zuma had
been recalled by the ANC, and was asked to resign from his position as state
president or face a motion of no confidence. However, he was defiant and
appeared in a last-minute TV interview to tell South Africa that he was going
nowhere. The
president’s state of the nation address, planned for 8 February that year, was
postponed for several days as the ANC scrambled behind the scenes to reign in
its rogue president after a decision to recall him. Just like
the threats and cries of war that were shouted at Nkandla this past weekend,
Zuma’s war-hungry supporters peddled conspiracies and untruths that the country
would end in a civil war if he stepped down. History
repeated itself after the judgment that instructed Zuma to report to jail by
Sunday, 4 July. Supporters,
including ANC leaders aligned to his faction, preached war and vowed to die for
Zuma, saying he would not be jailed. Cometh the hour when all their war
gimmicks and stunts had been spent, the former president’s motorcade drove out
of Nkandla with no fanfare, heading to prison. This huge
political and judicial moment will be inked in history books. No one, despite
their bottomless funds to use every legal trick to delay being held accountable
by our justice system, is above the law. Zuma is
accused of aiding the looting of billions of funds in a well-orchestrated state
capture, and under whose reign corruption levels soared. The jailing
of Zuma is victory for ordinary voters whose lives have become poorer and
desolate due to lack of service delivery as state funds lined up the pockets of
morally bankrupt political wolves. – Editor
