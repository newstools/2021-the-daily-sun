FOR seven years, these residents have had to wake up early every morning to sweep water out of their yards and into the street. The people of Phola Park, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun that the water came from under the ground. Johannes Mahlangu (57) said he wakes up in the morning, puts on his gumboots and picks up his broom to work. “We have been crying for the municipality to put pipes underground to direct the water. Officials came in December last year and promised to return in January, but never did. The water stinks and our kids play in it. “Everyday I have to wake up in the morning to sweep this water. I even had to buy gumboots. If I don’t sweep, the house gets smelly,” he said. Sophie Ndala (49) told Daily Sun that the street had been damaged by the water. “They did something wrong when they constructed the street. “They failed to deal with the water problem and now it’s affecting us,” she said. “I was even thinking of building a small bridge in front of my gate. “My father is too old and can’t jump over the water, so he has to step in and walk through.” Pinky Masilela (33) said the water caused mosquitoes to breed. “We fear we will contract malaria. There are too many mosquitoes, even in summer. When it rains, it becomes worse and the water blocks our gates,” she said. “We are still waiting for municipal officials to come back as they promised.” The residents said the water also made their houses very cold in winter. They said that they feared their health was at risk. Thembisile Hani municipal spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane-Mokoka said she was aware of the problem. “Our technical team will go back to the area to assess the situation and see how the problem can be fixed. “If there’s a need, we will outsource the job,” she said.
