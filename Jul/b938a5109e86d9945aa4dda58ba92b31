IF this world was fair, in all fairness, Chippa United must be on cloud nine today celebrating victory in the PSL promotion/relegation play-offs, which they’ve won to retain their DStv Premiership status. Not so fast! Now Siviwe Mpengesi, Chippa owner, must be wondering whether to take his players on a cruise because no one knows what will happen to the current state of the play-offs results and log. Royal AM’s court drama has put a massive poser and it’s unclear what the PSL has up its sleeves after they proceeded with the play-offs without the Durbanites’ participation. Royal AM, who failed to pitch for their last play-offs fixture at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium yesterday, threatened to take their legal battle with the PSL to another level with the Johannesburg High Court. This in their bid to enforce Acting Judge Nyathi’s order, “which declared that the actions of the league to remove them from the top of the GladAfrica Championship was unlawful, and they should be reinstated”. In fact, Royal AM, through their Head of Legal, Happy Godi, said the recently ended play-offs was just a waste of time and money for Chippa and Richards Bay who participated. The confrontational Royal AM refused to take part in all of the play-offs matches, though they showed up in the first match against Richards Bay FC, but changed their minds before kick-off and left. Royal AM chief executive, Sinky Mnisi, said they stand by their story of being GladAfrica Championship winners. He said this is why they sent their players back home to rest and go for holidays “to prepare for new season in the PSL”. “No one is in camp,” said Mnisi.
