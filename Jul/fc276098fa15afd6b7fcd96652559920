TEACHERS at Boitshepo Secondary School in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said they were sick and tired of risking their lives after several cases of Covid-19 were reported. They said this was not the first time that some staff members tested positive for the virus, but no deep cleaning was done at the school. On Tuesday, 29 June, teachers and other staff members were standing outside the premises as they vowed not to go inside until they received a report about when the school would be fumigated. The group told Daily Sun that last week, pupils also decided to stop their lessons after they discovered that one of the teachers had tested positive. “Our children are also worried because several cases were reported whereby our colleagues tested positive, yet the school is not cleaned. “We have tried to raise this matter with our superior but there are no answers. That is why we have resorted to stopping school proceedings and to take our concern to the Department of Education,” the group said. Another teacher said last Saturday, classes could not continue as there was a case but no deep cleansing took place. “We are glad pupils are not here. Our main concern is that we have to sign an attendance register on a daily basis, but we cannot do so until this matter is addressed.” Department spokesman Steve Mabona said: “We’re aware of the incident and call upon educators to explore other avenues to raise their concerns and displeasure, and not behave in an unpalatable manner.” Mabona said they were busy with the vaccination sector and wished to implore teachers to focus and support the project accordingly. “It’s common course that on Wednesday, leaners are going to recess. We must utilise this period to finalise this project,” he said.
