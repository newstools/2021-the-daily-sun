FOR all these years, it has been known as Honda Jazz. Though a good hatch, the Japanese felt it needed rebranding. Now this popular hatch is coming back as a petrol-electric hybrid model called Fit. Honda Motor Southern Africa said this was its first hybrid using its new eHEV technology. During the launch, its president Yuishi Fukuda said the Honda Fit would reassert their position as a brand, with outstanding quality, durability and technology. “Our rebranding strategy of the all-new Fit is aimed at re-enforcing the car as the best due to its space and practicability.” This fourth-generation car comes with bold windows, giving the driver the best view, especially the front screen. Basing the car on the Ballade chassis allows for enough space, including folding seats for a big boot. A big change is noticed in the front, with a rather simple front and sleepy eyes headlamps, giving it an almost concept-feel appeal – plain yet exciting.  The car comes in two models – a petrol and petrol electric hybrid, front-wheel drive with manual and auto transmissions. The base Fit petrol models are equipped with Honda’s new 1,5 DOHC i-VTEC petrol engine, dishing out 89kW of power and a whopping 145Nm of torque – powerful and efficient compared to the outgoing one with a fuel consumption of 5,5L/100km. The Fit Hybrid 1,5 DOHC i-VTEC is a mix of great performance and impressive efficiency with total outputs of 80kW and 250Nm of electric torque, pushing it to just over 9 seconds to a maximum speed of 175km/hour. It is set to compete where the Suzuki Swift and Polo have been dominating.
