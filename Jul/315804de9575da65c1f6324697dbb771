THERE will be no place to hide for Kaizer Chiefs players when they face holders Al Ahly in the Caf Champions League final in Morocco on Saturday. This was a message from former Chiefs winger Justice Sithole, who won the African Cup Winners Cup with Amakhosi in 2001. Sithole has the experience of facing Ahly with Amakhosi. He came from the bench when Chiefs were thumped 4-1 in March 2002 by the Egyptian giants in the Caf Super Cup final in Cairo – the only time these two sides have previously met. “We are not in the final by mistake. It was through the hard work of the players,” Sithole said. “Having reached this point there’s only one result and that is to win the final. “It’s time for them to be the heroes at Chiefs for years to come. I think this is their (players) time to make their mark.” No one would have predicted Chiefs would reach their first Champions League final this season after all their problems. Amakhosi were banned by Fifa from signing players for two transfer windows, struggled throughout the domestic season, which led to the sacking of coach Gavin Hunt late in May. Arthur Zwane, who was in that Cup Winners Cup final 20 years ago, was placed in charge on an interim basis. The 47-year-old former winger led his side when they beat Wydad Athletic Club in the semi-finals, winning the first leg 1-0 in Morocco at Mohamed V Stadium, the same venue that will host the final on Saturday. Zwane’s tactics frustrated the Moroccans. And although they were under pressure, goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma along with his defenders stood firm. Chiefs got over the line by employing a defensive approach that saw them hold Wydad 0-0 in the second leg at the FNB Stadium to see them reach the final and become the third side from Mzansi achieve this feat. “We are coming from a very difficult season,” added Sithole. “We weren’t happy with the things that were happening within the club. “But now we find ourselves in this position that can bring back the smile to many people’s faces.”
