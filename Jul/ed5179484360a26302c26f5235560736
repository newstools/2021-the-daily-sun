CAPE Town passengers live in fear after a taxi driver was shot dead on Saturday. The shooting came two days after the meeting between two associations and minister of transport and public works last week. The meeting followed after seven taxi drivers were shot and killed in different incidents around Cape Town. Codeta spokesman Andile Kanyi said they were confused by the recent killing. “We don’t know if there’s a third hand in all of this. But we are shocked and wish the law plays its part in bringing the perpetrators to justice,” said Kanyi. He said their driver was travelling from Khayelitsha to Mitchells Plain when he met his death. “Taxis are operating as usual,” added Kanyi. A resident in Khayelitsha said the war in the taxi industry would never end. “How many people should die for them to stop killing each other? Just last week, seven people were killed and they are continuing,” said the resident. She said that the industry didn’t care about the lives of passengers. “Why are they fighting? The worst thing about this is that sometimes, innocent people get caught in the crossfire. “We plead with them to sort out their differences and stop killing each other.” Captain FC van Wyk said circumstances surrounding the shooting incident at Japhta Masemola road between RR Temporals and Frans, Site B in Khayelitsha where a 28-year-old man was shot and fatally wounded, were under investigation. “A murder case was opened and the motive for the murder could be related to taxi violence,” said Van Wyk Anyone with any information was urged to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
