CCTV footage of a Nissan Maxima crashing into a petrol station pump has surfaced on social media. Behind the wheel of the Maxima was a 23-year-old woman who was reportedly drunk. In the video, she can be seen speeding across the road before crashing into the petrol pump. The force of the impact threw the pump to the ground while the Nissan briefly got airborne. Fire can then be seen engulfing the petrol pump but fortunately, emergency shear valves immediately shut off the fuel flow, preventing a massive blast had the underground tank exploded. According to Carscoops, the damage caused to the Maxima was huge.  Fire crews quickly responded to the scene and were able to extinguish the blaze. Cops arrested the woman and charged her with driving under the influence and child endangerment as her two kids, aged four and five years old, were in the car.
