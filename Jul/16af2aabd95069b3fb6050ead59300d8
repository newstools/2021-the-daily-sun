THE DA plans to lay criminal charges against EFF leader Julius Malema and former president Jacob Zuma’s children. The party claimed that Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, Edward Zuma, Duduzane Zuma and Malema had been inciting violence on social media. In a statement, the DA’s shadow minister of justice and correctional services, Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach said following Zuma’s arrest, his daughter Duduzile took to social media to post several tweets that encouraged and incited violence. In some of her tweets, she posted a picture with burning grass and wrote: “We want Nxamalala. We are not fighting anyone. We just want @PresJGZuma.” Breytenbach said these tweets followed utterances by Edward that law enforcement agencies would have to go through him before arresting his father. “These comments were inflammatory and reckless. There is also a video making the rounds on social media in which Duduzane wows to ‘fight’ to get his father out of prison.” ALSO READ: TLOF TLOF DOESN’T CURE COVID-19! She said Malema had threatened to join looters on the streets if the SANDF was deployed. “No soldiers on our streets! Otherwise, we are joining. All fighters must be ready. They won’t kill us all. We need a political solution to a political problem, not soldiers,” he tweeted on Monday. Breytenbach said the party was calling on the NPA and Police Minister Bheki Cele to act against the Zuma siblings and Malema, to ensure that they were investigated criminally for incitement to commit violence and their talk of war. “We cannot allow anyone to get away with this kind of reckless behaviour and make such sweeping statements with impunity. Failure to act will only embolden the Zumas and Malema to say and do what they want with no fear of consequence. The NPA and SAPS need to act against them now,” said Breytenbach.
