Gauteng is burning and a looting spree has erupted. Shocking videos and images of violent criminal acts with police firing shots have been circulating on social media. The alleged Pro-Zuma protest which began in KwaZulu-Natal extended to Gauteng on Saturday evening, July 10.  The protest was sparked by the incarceration of former President Jacob Zuma. On Sunday, July 11, alerts were sent out on social media calling for people to stay home as more protests are expected on Monday. Free state and Mpumalanga were called out to join the protest. Umlazi Square Mall in KwaZulu-Natal, Naledi mall in Vosloorus as well as Dobsonville Mall in Soweto, and Alexandra mall were some of the malls identified to have been looted.

Tension remained high with heavy police presence in Denver, Benrose, Berea, Jeppestown, Hillbrow, and Joburg CBD with burning tyres and vandalism. Earlier in the day, protestors were chanting for Zuma to be released and for President Cyril Ramaphosa to step down. Zuma was sentenced to a 15-months jail term by the Constitutional Court for contempt of its order to appear before the State Capture Commission.
