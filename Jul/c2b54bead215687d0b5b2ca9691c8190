ACTOR Joe Kazadi is calling for government to open churches. The actor known for his roles on The Queen and Isono, took to Instagram to claim that calm in the country would be restored once churches were opened. Joe said things have been chaotic since the day churches were closed, but would be better once they reopened. “Open churches and let the children of God worship, and there will be calm in South Africa.” Joe said if gyms and restaurants can be opened, then so can the church. This follows President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address on Sunday, 11 July, when he extended lockdown level 4 for two weeks, but opened fitness centres and restaurants for sit-ins. Some people weren’t happy about Joe’s suggestions because they said this would increase Covid-19 numbers. But the actor stood his ground. ALSO READ : PROTESTERS LOOT RADIO STATION! Reney Maley commented: “If God lives in us, we will carry Him everywhere we go. We will worship anywhere and His presence will be felt. The building doesn’t change the state of calmness but rather the God in us does.” Joe responded: “Sis wam’, I asked for the churches to be opened. If you don’t want churches to be opened and yet you are Christian, it’s fine.” Many commented that people didn’t need to be in a church building. But the actor said people who wanted to worship at home could, but he wanted to go to church. “In this case, we also refuse to accept we can’t be living in a country where people prioritise alcohol and not God. As much as it’s your right to worship at home, we also just want to attend church and worship our God together in unity. People in church respect Covid-19 regulations more than restaurants and clubs. “Don’t be surprised when people start gathering at gyms and restaurants,” said the actor.
