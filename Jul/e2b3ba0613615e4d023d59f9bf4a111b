THE SENTENCING of an Eastern Cape woman who forced three minors to have sex with each other has been postponed to 16 August. The 21-year-old woman was found guilty by the East London Regional Court on Wednesday, 30 June. She was convicted for two counts of compelled rape and sexual assault. According to NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakazi, the offences were committed between 2016 and 2018 when the victims were 11 years old. . “The 21-year-old woman from Duncan Village in East London, who was 16 years old in 2016, made her cousin-sister and their two neighbours, a boy and girl who were both 11 years old at the time, to watch pornography. “She forced the boy to have sex with the girls on two different occasions. She also forced the 11-year-old girl to lick her punani. The girl, however, never licked her punani but instead stroked it with her chin,” said Ngcakani. This conviction comes on the heels of a 12-year imprisonment sentence handed to 29-year-old Gqeberha woman who was found guilty of raping a 13-year-old boy in June last year. Thembhakazi Dyamani was accompanied by two boys to her relative’s house, where they all spent the night. She slept in between the boys and started to play with the 13-year-old’s 4-5 while they were sleeping. The boy tried to remove her hand but she instead inserted his 4-5 into her punani and had sex with him.
