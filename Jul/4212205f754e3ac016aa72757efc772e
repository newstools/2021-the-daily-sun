COMEDIAN PelePele Mchunu has warned people against a scammer pretending to be him. The award-winning comedian said the scammer had created a fake Facebook account, where he was giving out phone numbers to people, pretending they were his. To make people aware, PelePele took to Facebook to share screenshots of the person who was giving out his number on Facebook, and another one where he was asking for R400 on WhatsApp. He exposed the scammer’s number, and said he had not asked anyone for money.

Nginezimali zami mina and ngine award (I have my own money, and even an award),” wrote PelePele. This saga landed the comedian on a long list of celebrities who were also victims of scams. Actress Ayanda Borotho’s Facebook page was recently hacked. Another actress Simphiwe Ngema told her fans repeatedly that she did not have a Facebook account because there was a fake one under her name. Reality TV star Shauwn “MaMkhize” Mkhize, as well as presenter and medium Thembi Nyathi, were also recently victims of a scam.
