DYLAN Kerr says he is not worried about reports linking other coaches to the job he is hoping to secure at Marumo Gallants FC. Kerr won the Nedbank Cup and helped Gallants, who were formerly known as Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), survive relegation and many were expecting the 54-year-old to be given a new contract. But it is now uncertain if the Englishman will be handed a long-term contract. There have been reports linking four-times DStv Premiership winning coach Gavin Hunt and Dan Malesela to replace Kerr. It has also been reported that Gallants are busy talking to former Real Madrid assistant coach Pablo Franco Martin. Martin is without a club after leaving the Kuwaiti side Qadsia SC. Belgian born-mentor and Lithuania technical director, Patrick de Wilde, is another coach linked to replace the former Black Leopards and Baroka coach next season. A source confirmed to SunSport that it is difficult now to tell if Kerr will be with Gallants next season. “Everyone was sure that Kerr will be given a new contract after he achieved his mandate of helping the club survive relegation and winning the Nedbank Cup,” said the source. “But it is difficult to be certain if Kerr will be at Gallants (next season). Gallants chairman Abraham Sello had a meeting with Kerr when the club was launching their new name last month and everything seemed promising for Kerr. Since the meeting, Kerr is still waiting to hear from Gallants.” Kerr did not want to comment much on his contract issues. “I had a good talk with the chairman and I am still waiting to hear from them,” said Kerr. “I can’t comment more but I’m not worried about reports about other coaches as that has nothing to do with me. I know where I stand with the club chairman.”
