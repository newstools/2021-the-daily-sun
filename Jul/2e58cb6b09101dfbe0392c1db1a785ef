KAIZER Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung has backed youngster Happy Mashiane following his red card in the Caf Champions League final against Al Ahly. Mashiane was given his marching orders for a dangerous tackle on the stroke of halftime, a moment that “defined the outcome of the match,” according to Motaung. The Red Devils took full advantage of the situation as they banged in three unanswered goals through Mohamed Sherif, Mohamed Afsha, and Amr El Solia. Amakhosi’s dream of winning their maiden Champions League title disappeared before their eyes, thanks largely to Mashiane’s red card. Nevertheless, Motaung reckons the 21-year-old will learn from the experience and it will make him a better player. “I want to take this special moment to encourage Happy Mashiane,” said Motaung on the club’s website. “Happy must take this as a lesson and an experience that will come in handy in his career. "This is not his fault and this must serve as a lesson to everyone in the team. We must realise that these things happen in football and life in general. "Happy is still young and has a great future ahead of him. He is not alone, we are in this together.”
