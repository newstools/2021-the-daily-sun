SECURITY guards and other staff at Jubilee Hospital in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, were surprised to find a bouncing baby girl on their doorstep on Tuesday, 13 July.J Hospital spokesman Moses Tlamama said vendors first found the baby near the hospital entrance. He said the vendors told them they heard a baby crying from inside a bag. When they went to investigate, they found a newborn with her umbilical cord still attached. The vendors immediately took the baby to the security guards, who rushed her to the paediatric ICU for medical attention. He said the baby, who they named Reneilwe, was wearing wet and soiled clothes. “Upon her arrival in the ward, baby Reneilwe was immediately attended to and all necessary medical care was administered,” said Tlamama. “She was bathed and changed into warm clothes donated by the communications team at the hospital.” Tlamama said the baby would be taken to a place of safety. He described her as a beautiful and healthy baby. He said they didn’t know who the mother was or where she gave birth, as the child didn’t have a tag on her. “Me and the other staff members bought her clothes. Many other staff members have visited her and promised to bring more clothes for her,” he said. Postnatal unit operational manager, Martha Maswanganyi, said the baby was healthy and didn’t cry as much as other newborns. The hospital said a case was opened with the police and was being investigated.
