SA Under-23 national team captain  Tercious Malepe has admitted that preparations for the Olympics have not been as smooth as they would have liked. The team has been dealt a blow with three members testing positive for Covid-19 and are in isolation in the Tokyo 2020 isolation facility. The trio, which includes players Thabiso Monyane and Kamohelo Mahlatsi as well as video analyst Mario Masha, will not play any part in the opening match against hosts Japan at the Tokyo Stadium on Thursday (1pm). “To be honest, it was not easy for us as players,” admitted Malepe. “We came here knowing very well that we are under difficult times with Covid-19. But we did not expect what we are experiencing here. “Nevertheless, we are professional soccer players and we have to adjust. It’s not easy to spend three days in a room but those are situations we can’t control. “I always tell the boys that when we are in a situation we can’t control, just follow the rules. “It’s sad for the players who will miss out, it’s never nice to see a teammate miss out in a tournament like this due to something like Covid-19. It’s unfortunate.” Malepe, who will be playing in his second Olympics in a row, is still positive that they can be successful despite all the challenges they have faced. The 24-year-old former Orlando Pirates man is hoping to guide his side to a better finish than in Brazil in the last edition. “I was part of the last Olympics team in Brazil and from my experience, playing the hosts puts you in a situation where you are not under pressure,” added Malepe, looking ahead to the clash against Japan. “They are the ones who will be under pressure because they have to bring everything to get an early goal to calm their nerves. We just have to keep calm and play our game. We are very positive, regardless of the situation that we are in.”
