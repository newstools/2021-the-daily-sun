Acting Health Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane set Mzansi abuzz when she announced that those aged between 35 and 49 years are next in line to be vaccinated. The registrations will begin on 15 July, but government will begin vaccinating this group on 1 August. Kubayi-Ngubane revealed this on Friday, 9 July during a media briefing.

Two weeks ago, over 500 000 basic education workers began receiving their doses. Last week, the programme began focusing on those aged 50 and above. In the last 24 hours, the country recorded 22 910 new cases, representing a 34,4% positivity rate. Of these, 11 747 were in Gauteng. Overall, Kubayi-Ngubane said government’s vaccination programme has made significant strides. She said while indications are that the number of cases in Gauteng had peaked and are now declining, the province remains the country’s epicentre. “We should never let our guard down and think it is over,” she said. She expressed concern over the rise in numbers in the Western Cape, Limpopo, North West, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga.
