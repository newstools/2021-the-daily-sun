ACTIONSA leader Herman Mashaba has made his feelings clear since the Constitutional Court sentenced former president Jacob Zuma to 15 months imprisonment. Reacting to Zuma handing himself in to the uthorities, Mashaba said he welcomed the arrest. “His arrest is a victory for the rule of law, and affirms that no single individual is above the law and our constitution. Peace-loving and law-abiding South Africans want to see the laws of their country respected. Upholding the rule of law is a basic requirement for us to build an inclusive and prosperous future for all,” he said in a statement. ALSO READ: POPULAR DEEJAY FORCIBLY SHAVED IN PUBLIC! The former mayor of Joburg said the ANC must also take full responsibility for desecrating the rule of law through the creation of state capture and corruption. “It is our hope that Zuma’s incarceration will be the beginning of further arrests of all those who have blatantly and unashamedly broken the law and looted this country. “Our law enforcement agencies must ensure that justice is served on all those involved in state capture. This must include expediting the extradition of the Gupta family and facilitating the recovery of billions of monies stolen,” he added.
