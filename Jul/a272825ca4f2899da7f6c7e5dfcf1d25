MARITZBURG United, who have the “for sale” sign hovering over the club, have started rebuilding their squad that lost nine players at the end of last season. The KwaZulu-Natal outfit, which survived the relegation axe, parted ways with Kwanda Mngonyama, Bandile Shandu, Daniel Morgan, Dusan Stevic, Jethren Barr, Bongani Mpandle, Malebogo Modise (back to Mamelodi Sundowns), Tebogo Tlolane (back to Orlando Pirates), Keletso Sifama (back to Kaizer Chiefs). However, Maritzburg might be tempted to take things slowly in the transfer market because the club might not exist this coming season. Club chairman Farook Kadodia confirmed to SunSport recently that he is looking to sell the team before the season starts, if he fails to get either a sponsorship or a shareholder to invest in the team, as last season he lost about R9 million. He admitted it was “not sustainable to run the club with only the PSL monthly grants”. Kadodia is also suffering from the loss of gate takings due to Covid-19 that forced the PSL to play all matches, since last March, behind closed doors. It’s not clear when fans will be allowed back to the stadiums. While the club’s future is up in the air, they have welcomed former Black Leopards midfielder Lefa Hlongwane for assessment, as well as defender Alfred Ndengane. “Hlongwane has arrived to train with the club and Ndengane is coming soon,” said our insider.
