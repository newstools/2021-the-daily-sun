THE looters must get tested for Covid-19 before they start spreading the virus. This call was made by acting health minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane. She said the number of infections was expected to skyrocket in the next two weeks as a result of the recent unrest. “Those who were involved in the protest, please present yourselves at health facilities for screening because there’s a likelihood you are the carrier of the virus,” said Kubayi-Ngubane. She said she knows this might be seen as a way of arresting them, but she said they will not necessarily have to disclose many details. Kubayi-Ngubane said the people who were in crowded spaces during the looting were not worried about social distancing or the wearing of masks. “The consequences is we are going to have a surge in numbers,” she said. “The numbers will start trickling in from next week.” She said the high numbers of infection will soon be followed by a high number of hospitalisations and deaths. Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Ronald Lamola expressed concerns over the high number of people who’ve been arrested during the unrest, and brought to their facilities because it will put a strain on their systems. “We’re managing the situation because we now have almost a year of experience in managing, particularly those who come from outside the remand detainees,” said the minister.. “All those who are being arrested are quarantined together. We don’t mix them with inmates who are already inside our facilities.” He said those who were bust during looting and know they’re positive must present themselves to officials to avoid spreading the virus further in prisons.
