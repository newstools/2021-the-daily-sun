RAESIBE Rasebotsa was overjoyed when her application for an RDP was approved. But she’s now begging government to demolish it. The house has become a nightmare as a contractor arrived in 2010, dug a foundation, and put up walls but never put a roof on the structure. The matter has given the 56-year-old from Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, sleepless nights for more than 10 years. She said roofing material was delivered but later taken to another villager’s house. She said she was told new material would be delivered but it didn’t happen. “Government must come and demolish the house as it has brought me nothing but heartache,” she said. “It pains me every day to see this slab, so it would be better if it was removed. Maybe I’d then have peace of mind.” Raesibe said the structure put her life in danger. She said: “Thugs may steal things and hide them in this house. When stolen property is found in my yard, I’ll be the one in trouble. They may also want to hide and wait to attack me,” she said. Raesibe said she’d finish the house on her own if she had a job. “I believe I’m being taken advantage of as I can’t fight and I don’t have anyone to fight for me. I’m being denied my right to proper housing.” Raesibe said she was forced to share a two-roomed house with her 52-year-old brother. Acting spokesman for the Limpopo housing department, Papiki Tjebane, said the matter was being probed.
