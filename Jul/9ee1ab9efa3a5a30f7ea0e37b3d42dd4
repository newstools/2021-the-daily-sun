An Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department (EMPD) officer
died after he was shot in unrest in Katlehong, Gauteng. EMPD Officer Meshack Mahlangu was still alive but could not
get medical treatment during the chaos and eventually died. The shooting occurred at around 21:30 on Monday during
looting at Sam Ntuli Mall, EMPD spokesperson Chief Superintendent Kelebogile
Thepa said. "The deceased officer succumbed to [his] injuries after
an ambulance could not get access to the scene of the incident due to road
closures in the area," Thepa added. "[Officers] were responding to information that
protesters were flooding the mall when criminals opened fire on them while they
were monitoring the situation and trying to maintain law, order, peace and
stability in the area." A second officer was injured and hospitalised. Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili confirmed the
incident. She said seven other police officers were injured during
unrest in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. Mahlangu was based at the Zonkizizwe precinct, according to
Thepa. He would have celebrated 12 years of service in the EMPD the day after
his death. "His colleagues who witnessed the incident have been
provided with the necessary professional support," Thepa added. EMPD commissioner Isaac Jabulani Mapiyeye has appealed for
peace and order. "It is regrettable that the officer died [at] the hands
of the community he worked so hard to serve and save. It is extremely
unfortunate that we have lost such a dedicated member of staff who respected
and loved serving the people. We do hope that the community will assist us [in
finding] the perpetrators of this senseless act and put them behind bars where
they belong." SOURCE: NEWS24
