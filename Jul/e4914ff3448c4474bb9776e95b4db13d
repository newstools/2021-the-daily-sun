YOU would be forgiven for thinking you were watching a Hollywood movie. Our very own men and women in blue went house-to-house in kasis and squatter camps, flushing out looters and retrieving stolen goods. As I am writing this, I am watching images on TV from Mamelodi, Tshwane, where cops, with the assistance of soldiers, are looking for looters. This commendable work by our men and women in blue must give all of us hope that the unfortunate unrest has unleashed a police force we never knew we had. The unrest has awoken a sleeping giant. Now allow me to ask, if the police have such resources, why do we still have drug dens and dealers roaming our streets? Why has this level of force and dedication not been used to rid the country of drug dealers and other hardened criminals? I’m not exaggerating to say that in places like Sunnyside, Hillbrow, Long Street in Cape Town and Seventh Street in Melville, Joburg, drug dealers brazenly push their merchandise. Nyaope dealers don’t even bother to hide what they’re doing in the hood. It’s not like cops don’t know about this but sometimes, one feels sorry for them as they are overburdened. However, the events of the past few days have proven otherwise. The continuing police action, dubbed “operation show me your receipt”, has proved they can actually do what is expected of them, if there is political will. Is this level of response due to businesses and not communities being targeted? We have seen railway infrastructure get stripped across the country without anyone lifting a finger to stop it. This trend is tantamount to sabotage. We have not seen scrapyards being raided. Yes, there were arrests, but not on the scale we have seen with looters. If they can raid houses for days, why is the same energy not spent on looking for abducted girls and protecting our communities? We want to see more consistent police action from now on. This is the service we want and what we deserve.
