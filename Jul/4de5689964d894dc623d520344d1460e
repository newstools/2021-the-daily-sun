But it seems the French have some frisky neighbours who are perhaps just more discreet about playing away from home. 5. France The French people have always been thought of as fairly open-minded when it comes to matters of the heart. In fact, the traditional L’Heure Bleue refers to the hour after work when men would go and visit their mistress.
