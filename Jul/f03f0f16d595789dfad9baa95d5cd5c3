LONDON police said they made 20 arrests after fans gathered to celebrate England's 2-1 win over Denmark in Wednesday's Euro 2020 semi-final. Riot police were on hand as fans celebrated the country reaching their first major final since winning the 1966 World Cup. Traffic came to a standstill at Piccadilly Circus in central London when fans blocked streets and climbed on telephone boxes. "20 arrests have been made by officers for a number of offences including common assault, public order and assault on police," Met Police said on Twitter. England will face Italy in Sunday's final at Wembley. -REUTERS
