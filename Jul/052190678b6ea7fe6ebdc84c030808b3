CONTROVERSIAL former ANC councillor Andile Lungisa insists there’s no bad blood between him and the taxi industry. This after rumours spread on social media that Lungisa, who had served on Nelson Mandela Bay’s council, was involved in the murder of a taxi boss in Gqeberha on Thursday, 15 July. Uncedo Taxi Association chairman Diki Zamana (61) was shot multiple times by three unknown gunmen. The rumours came after Lungisa was forced by taximen across Nelson Mandela Bay to denounce looting. Lungisa said: “People on social media must stop using people’s names without permission. People are saying I was involved in the murder. “They are saying he was in a meeting with me and the one questioning me. The taxi boss was not present when we went to different ranks. I never met with him.” He urged people to allow law enforcement to conclude investigations. “The rumours could impact peace and stability in the metro. We continue to work with the taxi industry, and some even support me in structures of the ANC,” he added. Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana confirmed that Zamana was killed at Njoli Taxi Rank. “The killing happened in broad daylight. The three suspects then jumped into a getaway vehicle and are still at large. “The motive is unknown but police are following up on leads.” Police asked anyone with information to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111.
