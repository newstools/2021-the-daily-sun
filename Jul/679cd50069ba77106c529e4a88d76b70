AN MKMVA media briefing ended in chaos when journalists clashed with Zuma supporters. The briefing was held outside Jacob Zuma’s home in front of his supporters who were not observing Covid-19 level 4 regulations and kept bulling journalists when they ask questions on Friday, 2 July. Things went ugly when Newzroom Afrika journalist Linda Mnisi asked MKMVA spokesman Carl Niehaus a question about why he was encouraging people to come and defend Zuma as they would be breaking Covid-19 Level 4 regulations. Zuma’s supporters then reportedly bullied the journalist, and in solidarity, journalists were forced to end the media briefing. Before the chaos started Carl Niehaus addressed the media and said the MKMVA will form a human shield to protect President Jacob Zuma because they don’t want Jacob Zuma to go to jail. “President Jacob Zuma is the national patron in chief of MKMVA we will continue to protect him and, in the days, to come there will be a heavy presence of comrades to protect Zuma.

We will engage and be political but will be uncompromising in our position that our commander in chief cannot go in jail,” he said. Jacob Zuma supporters promised to stay there until the matter of arresting him is finalised.
