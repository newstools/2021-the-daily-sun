Singer Mikhale Jones tells the story of her heartbreak on her upcoming album, It Is What It Is. The 25-year-old from Naturena in Joburg said the album that will drop in October is inspired by her break-up. Mikhale told SunBuzz: “The album is based around my love story that didn’t have a happy ending. “It’s just to show that somethings just can’t be changed. “And yes, it’s unfortunate that some relationships don’t end well, but you have to take it as it is and move on. “Writing It Is What It Is helped me to heal. “I realised how far I’ve come after I saw how much people loved the single, Talk To Me, I released two weeks ago. “People have been saying they can relate and are happy they’re not alone. I hope the album does that for more people. “It’s about heartbreak and most of the songs were written while I was going through those emotions.

Mikhale said she’ll be dropping new singles every month, leading up to the album release in October. “Not only will I be dropping new singles, but I’ll be sharing videos. “The videos will be confessions tapes as though I’m speaking to a therapist. I’ll be speaking about my break-up and how I dealt with it,” said Mikhale. “I’ll be talking about the four stages of the break-up I went through. “The stages are titles of some songs in the project. People should look out on my social media for that.”
