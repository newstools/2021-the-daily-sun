A MAN who stopped a looting spree in Mahikeng, North West, says he feels overwhelmed that he managed to stop what nearly became a disaster. Thato Molosankwe, an activist who has been advocating against crime and corruption in the province, said he was not about to stop. He saved Mahikeng town from people who came running with the intention to loot shops. “As you can see, we are cruising here in Mahikeng. It’s peaceful and the town is clean. Everyone is safe and we are happy,” he said. Some parts of Mzansi have been rocked by looting incidents by some residents calling for former president Jacob Zuma to be released from prison. But what Thato did inspired many people in other provinces who have now taken a stand against looting. Molosankwe, known in Mahikeng as Senganga, established a team led by six people who help him control the situation. They walk around town with more than 200 people every day, assuring businesses they will be protected against thugs. Local business people provided them with food. “Everyone is coming on board. Today, a local member of the community cooked soup for 200 of us. We are grateful,” he said. They visit villages as well as malls and filling stations. Thato said people used to think he was a crazy person as he walked many kilometres, advocating against crime and corruption. He also slept outside the North West legislature building for more than a month earlier this year. “Finally, people understand what I’m talking about. I was taken for a mad person, who’s insane. But when people saw reports on TV, they started to wake up,” he said.
