A 65-YEAR-OLD madala was injured after a python bit him while he was sitting inside the toilet at home. He reportedly felt a touch on his genital area before noticing a 1,6m snake beneath him in the toilet bowl. The python, a constrictor native to Asia that can grow to nearly 9m, is thought to have found its way into the toilet via the network of drains. According to Sky News, the victim needed treatment in hospital for minor injuries. Although the snake’s suspected route into the toilet could not be confirmed, it is thought to have escaped from a neighbour’s apartment. A reptile expert was called to remove it from the toilet, who then cleaned and returned it to its owner. The 24-year-old neighbour, who owns 11 snakes, was reported to the prosecutor’s office on suspicion of carelessly causing bodily harm.
