PITSO Mosimane is not a man who lives in comfort zone. And the Al Ahly mentor is proud of that. Talking to media during Safja online press conference last Wednesday, Mosimane said he is aware of the possibility of losing his job if they fail to defend the Caf Champions League title against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. “I am living on the edge,” Mosimane said. On Saturday, he will lead the Red Devils when they face Chiefs in the tournament’s final at Mohammed V Stadium in Morocco. Before last night’s match in the Egyptian Premier League, Mosimane’s charges were in second spot on 48 points, 13 behind leaders Zamalek. But they had five games in hand. “In Egypt, if you don’t win the Champions League and the (domestic) league you might as well try to look the other way (for a new job). That’s why I am here. I am on the edge. I am done with comfort zones,” Mosimane stated. “I must be on the edge and see what I have because it is easy to stay in an area and you keep winning, but I love to face the cold front and it is not easy.” With Al Ahly president, Mahmoud “Bebo” El Khatib, known as a hard man to impress, the Champions League title is expected to remain in Cairo if Mosimane knows what’s good for him. At the least, if he fails to bring it home, Ahly will need to catch up in the league and overtake rivals Zamalek at the top. Mosimane ended his eight year stay at Mamelodi Sundowns last September to join the Egyptian giants. Since arriving at Ahly, Mosimane has already lifted four trophies – the Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, the 2020 Champions League and Caf Super Cup. He added: “I jumped from Sundowns because I knew that the DStv Premiership is sorted, let’s be honest. Any coach can be able to win the league with a team like Sundowns as that team can win the league for the next four years.”
