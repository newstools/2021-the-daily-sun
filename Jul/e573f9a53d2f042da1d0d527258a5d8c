IT is not for a lack of ambition that Arthur Zwane doesn’t want to take the Kaizer Chiefs head coach job on a permanent basis... just yet. Zwane has yet to lose a game in four outings since he took over on an interim basis, along with co-coach Dillon Sheppard. And that fine run has led to calls for him to assume the hotseat on a full-time basis, despite Stuart Baxter having been appointed to the position. But the former Amakhosi star winger is not keen on the job for now. “I would like to take things one step at a time,” Zwane told Marawa Sport Worldwide listeners. “I know people will always have their opinions and I respect that, but it goes down to one thing, I want to grow and be ready. When the time is right, yes, I’ll be given the opportunity, I know. “At the moment, the focus is on development and helping our boys. I think that link-up is helping very well in terms of the transition and you know the integration of the players from development into the first team.” Zwane guided Amakhosi to a top-eight finish in the PSL and has taken them to their first-ever Caf Champions League final where they are set to face Egyptian giants Al Ahly in Casablanca on July 17. However, he is keen to work with Baxter and learn from the PSL title-winning coach.  “Having someone like coach Stuart, I think I’ll learn a lot from him,” added Zwane.  “I once worked with him, when I had just stopped playing and also learned that time when I had the opportunity to learn from him first-hand.   “I don’t want to lose that opportunity to grow under his wings.”
