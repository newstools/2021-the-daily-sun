WITH the little money Lettie Mokanyane (49) got as a part-time cleaner, she has been slowly improving her RDP. But it took only one night to reduce it to ashes. Lettie from Slovo, Springs in Ekurhuleni, woke up on Sunday night, 11 July, as she felt she was being suffocated by smoke. Lettie said the electricity went off and when it came back on, the fire started. By the time she woke up, part of her house had been gutted. The smoke was thick and hot when she jumped out of bed to wake her child. Neighbours were already outside breaking down the door and luckily, Lettie and her child managed to escape the fire. She said she lost everything.

Lettie said she’s grateful God spared their lives. A neighbour said they used buckets of water to try and put out the fire. “We thought it would die down, but it didn’t,” said the resident. Firefighters from Ekurhuleni Emergency Services arrived to put out the fire. Spokesman William Ntladi advised residents not to endanger their lives when trying to put out fires. An inquest was opened at Springs Police Station.
