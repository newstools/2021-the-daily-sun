THE Mcelu family is devastated by the death of their two sons who died in a shack fire. This comes after their mother’s shack in Phola Park in Gugulethu, Cape Town, caught fire on Wednesday, 14 July. And the family believes the fire that killed Sinalo (14) and Ayanda (9) was vutha. The mum of the kids was traumatised and asked the SunTeam to speak to her brother. According to the boys’ uncle Olwethu Bhilikwana (40) his sister locked the boys in the shack when she went to a neighbour’s house. “She locked them in because there are a lot of criminals in this area, but she never thought something like this would happen,” he said. Olwethu said his sister heard from residents that her shack was on fire. ALSO READ: EX-UKHOZI FM HOST: ‘I DON’T FEEL SAFE ANYMORE’ “They tried to save them, but the fire was too strong. We suspect the fire was vutha as it started at the door. The kids’ bodies were found under the bed. It shows they hid when they saw the fire because their mother left them sleeping. It is difficult to accept they are gone and we feel bad about this,” said Olwethu. Resident Dunyiswa Mayongo (32) said they tried to save the boys but couldn’t.
