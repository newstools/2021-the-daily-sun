PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has said that it’s clear the riots that took place in the country were planned and co-ordinated by people. He was speaking at Bridge City Shopping Centre in KwaMashu, north of Durban, on Friday morning, 16 June. He was accompanied by the Minister of Police Bheki Cele, Minister of State Security Ayanda Dlodlo, KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala and other MECs to assess the impact of the recent public violence and the deployment of security forces. His visit follows government’s engagements with different sectors of society, including business, interfaith leaders and leaders of political parties represented in Parliament. Speaking to the media outside the badly damaged shopping centre, Ramaphosa said he will interact with the provincial government and security forces. He said it’s clear that all the riots were planned by people. ALSO READ: TRAUMATISED MUM: IT HURT ME TO THROW HER! “We are after those people. A good number of them have been identified. We will not allow anarchy in our country. There has been a lot of damage and people have lost lives,” he said. Ramaphosa said in KZN alone 95 people have died and many jobs have been lost. “We could have done better but we were overwhelmed by the situation,” he said. He said the police and soldier’s were on the ground to deal with the situation. “We are on hourly contact with the premiers. As government we are very concerned about what has happened and we are doing everything we can to deal with it,” he said. Ramaphosa said before there were suggestions that the riots had ethnic sentiments but after it was properly analysed, it was found that this has nothing to do with ethnicity. He also stated that he applauds former president Jacob Zuma for doing the right thing by handing himself to the police. The president also visited other areas such as Springfield and Emobeni.
