THE head of Amabutho, Zihogo Nhleko commonly known as Mgilija has been expelled. The removal comes after his alleged defiance and taking the Zulu regiments to show solidarity with former president Jacob Zuma without permission. In a statement released by the chairperson of the Usuthu Royal Council, Dr. Dumisani Khumalo, Mgilija was described as having transgressed several times leading to the council deciding to expel him. “In response to repeated transgressions and unacceptable conduct by a leader of Amabutho, Mr. Zihogo Nhleko, a meeting was convened this week of regimental Indunas, Abantwana, and Indunas in charge of all the regions of the Usuthu area over which His Majesty the king has direct responsibility,” Khumalo said. #ZumaArrest #ZuluRoyalHousehold In a statement released by the chairperson of the Usuthu Royal council, Mgilija has transgressed several times leading to the council deciding that he be expelled.@Newzroom405 pic.twitter.com/NScfJK7ugj  He added that a conclusion was reached that Mr. Nhleko’s conduct can no longer be tolerated. “Instance of his misconduct started before the death of the late King, His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini.
