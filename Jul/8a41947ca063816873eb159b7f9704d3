FOR the past week, Mzansi has been faced with a difficult time as thousands of people lost their jobs, while others had their businesses vandalised, looted and burnt. The violent protests came after former president Jacob Zuma was jailed last Wednesday. While some people took to the streets to demand his release, others took the opportunity to loot shops and malls. But one group has decided to come together and help rebuild infrastructure and vandalised businesses. These members offered their help through their expertise – from donating money to offering to clean the shops and vandalised malls. Rebuild South Africa was created on Facebook by Emelda Masango from Soweto. The group has so far accumulated over 19 000 followers. Most people have asked where they can help and what to donate as well as sharing their availability to volunteer with cleaning and food. Emelda said when she started the initiative, she anticipated a few people would volunteer to help clean and clear the worst affected areas in Soweto. But instead, the initiative took flight. “We have been contacted by numerous companies, media outlets and volunteers. We have been inundated with people who genuinely care about South Africa. The true spirit of ubuntu,” she said. Emelda never anticipated that her small act of kindness would reach even the most affected in such a profound way. “I’m proud and overwhelmed. I have team members who have volunteered to help as we navigate a simple gesture of peace and love,” she said. On Facebook, Gaby Frawley said: “Definitely not alone. No more talking; we’re ready for action. Let’s make this country greater than it ever was.” Noel Jelliman said: “Well done on this wonderful initiative. God bless you.”
