WHEN looting breaks out, it seems like nothing can be done to restore order. But that’s not necessarily true. If you own a business or shopping centre in these turbulent times and you are worried about your stock being looted, cooking oil may be your solution. Two videos of men pouring cooking oil on the floor inside a mall have surfaced. It appears this was done to cause looters to slip on the floor when they break into the mall. In the first video, several men can be seen spreading litres of cooking oil across the floor while laughing.

Shoprite employees pored cooking oil outside the store so looters can't get in.
