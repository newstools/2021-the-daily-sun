spoke to his wife and she is not ok. I only heard that he was sick and then
rushed to the hospital. I currently do not have confirmation on the cause of
his death. I spoke to him last week and he was fine so this comes as a
shock." Speaking to

not have anything to say. I cannot even think straight at this moment. His wife
