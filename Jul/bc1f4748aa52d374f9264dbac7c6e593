T he rule of law has finally prevailed. South Africa should celebrate the decision by former president Jacob Zuma to hand himself over for his long-awaited incarceration. He has been acting in a delinquent manner, trying hard to string along the judiciary. Worse is that he has been arrogant in doing so. Zuma somehow believed he is untouchable, and can do anything he wants when it comes to his fate with the judiciary. He got a taste of the rule of law. His strategy to portray himself as a victim of a political conspiracy did not work. He was ill-advised, and must now suffer the consequences. It is not true that there are some conspiracies against him. It is also unfortunate that some people disregarded lockdown regulations to support him. This means they see the life of one person as more important than those of our citizens. It is too bad that the people who claim to be leaders are the ones doing this. The Constitutional Court’s decision to jail Zuma must be taken as a tough lesson to those who think Mzansi is a banana republic with laws that are not worth respecting. This is going to strengthen our democracy as people will now take our institutions seriously. Zuma’s political gimmicks did not pay off. Instead, they landed him in a worse situation because his actions were only to please his supporters. At last, the rule of law has the last laugh.
