STELLENBOSCH FC confirmed yesterday that they have renewed the contract of their veteran defender and captain, Robyn Johannes. Johannes, who arrived at the club just after the 2019-20 season had started, saw his contract expire last week. However, the contract had an option to be renewed and the club has since taken up that option. “Johannes’ contract has been renewed and he’s working hard on his rehab,” said Stellenbosch CEO Rob Benadie. The 34-year-old, who was given the captain’s armband at the beginning of last season, suffered a bad injury against SuperSport United in March. He missed the last 10 league matches and his absence was felt as the Cape Winelands club finished 14th on the DStv Premiership table. The Stellies failed to win any of the 10 matches their skipper missed at the end of last season. However, the club believe his experience will be needed next season, as they hope to improve on last season’s finish. Johannes has been around the block in the PSL. He made his PSL debut with Mamelodi Sundowns under coach Gordon Igesund as a 20-year-old against Maritzburg United on 26 November 2006. Since then Johannes has played for Orlando Pirates, Golden Arrows, Maritzburg, AmaZulu, Cape Town City and the now defunct Bidvest Wits. He has won two league titles, two MTN8 trophies, one Nedbank Cup and the Telkom Knockout. He has featured in 237 matches, scoring four goals with five assists.
