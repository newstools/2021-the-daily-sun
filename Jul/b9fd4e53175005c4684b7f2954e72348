THREE former Black Leopards players, Mthokozisi Nene, Roggert Nyundu and Thivhavhudzi Ndou are training with new GladAfrica Championship side Venda Football Academy with the hope of winning a contract and reviving their careers. The trio started training with VFA last week and tomorrow they have to prove to coach Johnny Ferreira that they deserve a contract when the Venda-based-side face DStv Premiership side Cape Town City in a friendly match in Polokwane. Forgotten midfielder Nene (33) and striker Nyundu (33) struggled to get a team last season. Nene last played for Championship outfit Polokwane City two seasons ago, while Nyundu was on the books of Lidoda Duvha in 2020. However, the former AmaZulu player’s contract was terminated just a month after joining Leopards. Defender Ndou (30), who spent seven years at Leopards left the Venda-based outfit after his contract expired last month. Former Marumo Gallants and Rise and Shine goalkeeper, Bongani Manavhela, is the other player spotted training with VFA with the hope of joining them. For the past two weeks, the 28-year-old goalie and gospel singer was training with Gallants. “I left Gallants as they were not saying anything to me whether they will give me a contract or not,” said Manavhela. “I am now with VFA as they have been contacting me. I have been training with them and I am hoping for the best. “So far, they have been treating me well and they are running everything professionally.” VFA are also talking to former Bafana Bafana and Mamelodi Sundowns striker Tokelo Rantie with the hope of giving him the chance to revive his fading career. Rantie played for Bahlabane ba Ntwa last season on a short-term contract, but was released after failing to impress at the end of last season.
