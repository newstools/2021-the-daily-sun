AS many as five coaches would have guided Bafana Bafana by the time the Cosafa Cup ends. It could even be more, judging by the rate with which the effects of Covid-19 have had on Bafana’s technical team. The team kicked off their Cosafa tournament without temporary head coach Helman Mkhalele who has been withdraw as a precaution after he tested positive. Morena Ramorobeli has been roped in to guide Bafana, who got their campaign off to an ideal start with a win (1-0) over Botswana. Ramorobeli has replaced Mkhalele in the hot-seat, who stood in for Hugo Broos. Broos can’t travel to South Africa as he awaits his Covid-19 jab in his native Belgium. Safa are probably crossing their fingers that no one withdraws from the team at this stage as that may just leave the team without enough personnel to honour a fixture. I’m not even talking about the other teams in the tournament, who might be facing similar Covid challenges. Comoros and Madagascar didn’t even bother arriving for the shindig, opting not to travel to Mzansi due to Covid fears. The bottom line is, football under Covid-19 is just not football. Staging the tournament under the conditions that they may increase the risk of death from the coronavirus is plain irresponsible. The same goes for rugby bosses, who are probably praying that the British & Irish Lions tour goes through without incident. The tour has been thrown into disarray after the upcoming match against the Bulls was postponed. On top of that, the Springboks have been hit with another Covid cases, including head coach Jacques Nienaber. The Lions will have to find an opponent for the weekend as they prepare themselves for the big three Tests against the Boks. The quality of the matches may be compromised by the absence of key players for all the matches. That is if they go ahead, at all.
