CAPE Town City FC confirmed the signing of Bafana Bafana veteran goalkeeper Darren Keet. The 31-year-old returned to South Africa's top-flight to join Citizens on a free transfer from GladAfrica Championship outfit Cape Umoya United after his short term deal with the side lapsed. Keet, who has been based in Gauteng and had two stints with Bidvest Wits, joined The Citizens on a three-year deal. The goalkeeper has never played for any team in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) except Wits. Overseas he had spells in Belgium with Kortrijk and OH Leuven. Keet will replace Dutch goalkeeper Peter Leeuwenburgh who parted ways with the Citizens at the end of last season to join FC Groningen at his homeland, Netherlands. Talking to the club media, Keet said he was excited to be back in Cape Town. "I'm just excited to join the club I am looking forward to it. I think it will be a great couple of years for me. I am from Cape Town, I grew up in Cape Town and I have only played my professional football out of Cape Town," said Kee. "Cape Town City is a team that always want to win trophies so I am excited with the partnership we have. "I will try to give my best week in week out and try to improve our goal. I am looking forward to work with coach Eric Tinkler against I have known him from my stint at Bidvest Wits where he was an assistant coach for us. I am looking forward to rekindling that relationship whereby we had some success." Keet's has previously made 122 league appearances across two stints with now-defunct Wits and won the PSL title during the 201-17 season with The Clever Boys.
