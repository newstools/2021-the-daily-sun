Six people were arrested following a business robbery and
shootout with Western Cape police in Vredenburg on Thursday. Police launched a manhunt after a group robbed a grocery
store in Main Road, Vredenburg, at around 08:00. Two armed robbers allegedly entered the shop while four
accomplices waited outside, said police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk. "The suspects inside the shop threatened the manager
and a security guard and held them hostage in a small room and demanded
money," he said. "A security guard outside the shop became suspicious
and pushed the panic alarm. Within minutes the policeâ€¦ arrived on the
scene," he said. While fleeing the scene, the robbers fired several shots at
the police. Police returned fire. "The suspects fled with an undisclosed amount of cash
and cellular telephones. Nobody was injured during the shootout. However,
police and civilian vehicles were damaged," Van Wyk said. Hijack Following the shootout, two armed suspects hijacked an
elderly man's Toyota Camry at a grocery store in Louwville. They then fled in
the direction of Steve Tshwete, where the vehicle was later found abandoned at
the railway tracks. One firearm was found on the corner of Velddrif Road and
School Street and another at the old Tourism Office in Main Road. Police then got a tip-off that the robbers were hiding at
different houses in Sink Street, Ongegund. "The members followed up the information and searched
all the houses pointed out according to the information received, and arrested
six suspects aged between 21 and 35 at different premises in the area,"
Van Wyk said. They are due to appear in the Vredenburg Magistrate's Court
once charged. SOURCE: NEWS24
