SEKHUKHUNE United have appointed former Lesotho national team coach Thabo Senong as their new assistant coach. Senong, who is a former SA Under-20 national team coach, will be second in command to head coach McDonald Makhubedu. The 40-year-old Senong might not have much experience in the PSL, but he brings a wealth of coaching experience having been a coach for 17 years. His list of accomplishments includes back-to-back Cosafa Cup titles in 2017 and 2018 with the U-20. He also helped the side qualify for two World Cup tournaments in a row. Senong holds a SAFA level 3, Caf A and Fifa coaching instructor certificates among others. He will replace former assistant Selaotse “Sly” Mosala who parted ways with the club on Friday. Mosala was part of the technical team that helped the Limpopo outfit gain promotion to the top flight, albeit in a dramatic manner. He was not the only casualty at the club as they prepare to beef up ahead of their debut campaign in the top flight. Football manager Peter Koutroulis also departed the club after his contract came to an end. Senong will now hope to help Babina Noko hold their own in their debut campaign in the top flight next season. “I am honoured to be part of the Sekhukhune United Football Club project, the club suits my values and beliefs as a person,” said Senong in a statement released by the club. Babina Noko’s chairman, Simon Malatji, is confident that Senong is the right man to help the club achieve its goals next season. “I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Mr Senong to Babina Noko,” said Malatji. “We know his work ethic and we know he will work well with the Technical team, while we’re trying to rebuild and ensure we have a formidable side for the new season.”
