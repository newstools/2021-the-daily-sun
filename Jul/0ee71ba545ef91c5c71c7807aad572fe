CORONAVIRUS has affected almost all industries in the world and sex workers were not spared. In a bid to bring solid support to sex workers, the government in India promised to provide a Covid-19 relief fund to keep them going. According to Hindustan Times, a total of 1 715 sex workers from Pune, India have now claimed that they have not received any cent from the government, which was promised to them at least nine months ago. The publication reported that as per a Supreme Court ruling, which dates back to 21 September 2020, each worker was expected to get 15 000 rupees (about R2888,45) as a relief measure.
