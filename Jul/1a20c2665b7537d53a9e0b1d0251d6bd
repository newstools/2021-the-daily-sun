POLITICIANS have reacted to the deployment of soldiers to deal with the looting taking place in kasis across Mzansi. The DA on Monday, 12 July, called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to authorise the deployment of the South African National Defence Force to targeted areas. DA leader John Steenhuisen said the deployment of soldiers would help supplement the role of the police who are battling to stop the looting. “The president’s solemn words of condemnation in his televised address last night, along with his promises that those breaking the law will face consequences, are not enough. He needs to back these words up with decisive action, and he needs to do so today still,” he said. ALSO READ: MTHEMBU HONOURED WITH SPECIAL FUNERAL, MEMORIALS! Leader of ActionSA, Herman Mashaba, said the deployment of soldiers was correct but a little too late. “While we support this decision whole-heartedly, having called for this since yesterday, it’s maddening that it took so long for President Ramaphosa to provide the requisite leadership on this matter. “The president must now also establish special courts to expeditiously treat these cases of violence and lawlessness,” he said. Meanwhile, EFF leader Julius Malema said he was against the decision. “No soldiers on our streets! Otherwise, we are joining. All fighters must be ready. They won’t kill us all. We need a political solution to a political problem, not soldiers,” he tweeted. In his address on Sunday 11 July, Ramaphosa said: “Let us be clear, as a nation, that we will not tolerate acts of criminality. Those who are involved in acts of violence will be arrested and prosecuted.”
