FORMER President Jacob Zuma said he is very concerned that Mzansi is fast-moving back to the old apartheid regime. Zuma had a media briefing on Sunday night at his home in Nkandla. This comes after the Constitutional Court agreed to hear his presentation again on 12 July. The Constitutional Court ordered Zuma last week Tuesday to hand himself over to the police in Johannesburg or in Nkandla within five days. He said he is facing long detention without trial while elsewhere ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule has a burning order that prohibits him from addressing meetings. “Being jailed without a trial is not different to the apartheid detention without the trial. I believe in the rule of law. I fought and went to prison and exile so that there must be justice and rule of law in our country." “No honest person can accuse me for being an enemy of the law and I’m pursuing the constitution to deal with this by going to court again,” he said.

Justice must be fair to all people. There must be no law that is working for Zuma only,” he said. He still maintains that had Judge Raymond Zondo recused himself as the state capture commission chairman and allowed someone neutral to hear his submissions, Mzansi people would have heard his testimony. “I never refused to go to the commission to testify." "But I will not go there because the judge is biased." “It's also wrong to call the state commission with the name of Zondo because what will happen if one of his family members is implicated. I was forced to appear before the person I have accused of bias,” he said.
