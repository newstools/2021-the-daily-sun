POLICE Minister Bheki Cele went to KZN on Wednesday night, 14 July. He made the rounds, assessing the damages caused in the province since looting and violent protests began over the weekend. While making the rounds, Cele discovered more than a thousand rounds of ammunition in Mobeni, outside Montclair. The minister said the narrative that people are looting because of hunger is a “smokescreen” for planned attacks against the state. “It tells us that there are people preparing for war on the other side, not just looters. It’s something that we’ve been saying that this thing of hungry people looting for food, this is not food and if you’re hungry this is not something that you start to loot,” Cele said. He said they are dealing with something that is bigger than they thought. The minister also went to Mamelodi in Tshwane.
