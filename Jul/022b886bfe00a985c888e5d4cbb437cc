EVERY year on Mandela Day, Mzansi is in high spirits to celebrate the founding father of our democracy and former president Nelson Mandela on his birthday, 18 July. Fighting for peace and human rights for all, irrespective of race or gender is the greatest legacy Mandela left us. The world admires us for this and continues to take lessons from us. Instead of using that spirit as we usually do to celebrate our resilience and inspire hope and national unity, we are numb in shock over the looting and violent unrest holding many South Africans hostages in their homes today. Mandela Day reminds us that we can make a positive impact in other people’s lives; that all of us have the individual power to make a difference. This year it finds us wounded and broken after the chaos and destruction we have seen. What has happened to Madiba’s beloved nation? Why have we let a group of criminals who blatantly don’t want to obey the laws of this country invade our homes and communities to sow division, hate and mayhem among us? Scenes of parents and gogos running alongside their kids to loot alcohol, plasma TVs and food is a time of reckoning on our individual responsibility over the mess we are in. Are we going to continue spitting on Mandela’s grave and those of all struggle heroes whose blood was spilled to free us? Or are we going to reject calls by criminals and to ruin a South Africa where citizens are free and safe? Stop any attempts to invite you to tear down what our forefathers have built. Choose to fight to restore the dignity of Mandela’s legacy and say no to these destructive riots. – Editor
