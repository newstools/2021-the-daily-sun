THE South
African Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights (SAPOHR) has urged former
President Jacob Zuma to take the prison sentence ‘like a man.’ The
organisation has also called for the former statesman to hand himself over to
law enforcement. SAPOHR said
they are not in the business of celebrating the imprisonment of any human
being. Golden
Miles Bhudu, SAPOHR spokesman said, “Having said that, thought SAPOHR, we plead
with the former President, that he can rise above the occasion, and prove all
his detractors wrong, by simply handing himself over to the relevant law
enforcement agencies, so that he complies with the Judgement of the highest
court in the land. “This will
indeed surprise and outrage his enemies and detractors. It will also leave them
with nothing much to say.” Bundu added
that Zuma should plead with his supporters not to accompany him when he hands
himself over to the law enforcement agencies. “We hope
those who are in love of the public grandstanding aren’t going repeat the scene
we witnessed when Tony Yengeni and Andile Lugisa handed themselves over to the
prison authorities.” There are
reports doing the rounds that the former President is likely to get special
treatment once in prison. Bundu said
when Zuma is admitted to a correctional facility he should do what other
prisoners do like standard prison procedures.
