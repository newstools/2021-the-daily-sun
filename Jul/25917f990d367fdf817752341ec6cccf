Their answers were then analysed by age group, with the younger below the age of 23, middle-aged between 23-35 and older being 36 and over. When it comes to sexual attractiveness, women aged 36 and over proved to be the most confident in their skin with eight out of 10 saying they felt sexy. However, only four out of 10 women in the middle-aged group said they were happy with their appearance while seven out of 10 women under 23 said the same. The older women also scored highest when it came to climaxing with nearly six out of 10 reporting more frequent and better orgasms.
