FORMER Kaizer Chiefs coach Muhsin Ertugral has urged
Amakhosi players to seize the moment when they face Al Ahly in the Caf
Champions League final on Saturday evening (9pm). “It is something else to play a Champions League final,”
Ertugral said as per the club website. “These players might play many cup finals, but this one is a
once in a lifetime achievement. I know players like Lebogang Manyama and
Itumeleng Khune, players who I have worked with, are still around the team and
this is a lifetime achievement for them and the other players,” “It is not going to be easy, as Al Ahly are going to be very
competitive,” he added. Ertugral was the last man to lead Kaizer Chiefs to a
continental title two decades ago. He led Amakhosi to the 2001 African Cup Winners’ Cup title,
a forerunner to the current Confederation Cup. The 61-year=old mentor believes Amakhosi have the quality to
put up a good performance in the final. He stated: “There’s a structure that they will have and
through this structure their individual brilliance will come together and
through the brilliance of this team, I think they can achieve it”. When looking back at the Chiefs’ triumph in 2001, Ertugral
was adamant that “the most important game” was the quarterfinal second leg
against Egyptian giants Ismaily. “Ismaily won the Egyptian title that season and were a
strong team. The first leg at Ellis Park ended 0-0, in the second leg we made
changes early on and Arthur Zwane scored, and we drew 1-1 and went through,”
recalled Ertugral. Now, another Egyptian Goliath in Al Ahly awaits to be
overcome if Amakhosi are to add a coveted first African Champions League title
to the African Cup Winners Cup title Ertugral’s side, so proudly won for the
Amakhosi. Ertugral feels Chiefs are in a better position now with a
single-legged final, instead of a two-legged final which back in 2001 saw
Chiefs draw the away leg against Inter Clube of Luanda 1-1 and then win the
second leg 1-0 in Johannesburg.’
