WHAT happened to public interest? That is how EFF leader Julius Malema reacted to North Gauteng High Court’s decision to dismiss his party’s application to have the bank statements of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign made public. On Tuesday, 20 July, the court delivered a short judgment that Ramaphosa was not forced to reveal his funders ahead of the 2017 presidential race. Malema took to Twitter to voice his disappointment. “Our courts, to say I’m disappointed is an understatement.” The EFF relied on Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s now invalidated report on the campaign finances when it approached the court to force the disclosure of statements. Mkhwebane had submitted the records when Ramaphosa challenged her report. The documents were obtained when her office was investigating the campaign. She wrote there was a risk of some sort of state capture, given the amount of money raised. Deputy judge president Aubrey Ledwaba sealed the documents at the request of Ramaphosa’s lawyers, who said they contained sensitive information. The EFF, which was ordered to pay costs, had said unsealing the records was in the public interest. This month, the Constitutional Court found that the Constitution and Public Protector Act did not empower Mkhwebane to investigate the private affairs of political parties.
