REGGAE music is a platform for Tsoseletso Motsepe to be a mouthpiece for the youth, women and children. The 25-year-old musician from Sebokeng in the Vaal is better known as Reign Afrika. Tsoseletso said reggae music was where she dealt with depression and other matters that affected the youth. “I’m the right candidate as I was once insecure of my looks and voice, which led me to being an introvert. I was anxious of how people perceived me.” Tsoseletso released her first reggae album On the Frontline last December. She wanted to break down the stereotypes and challenges faced by women in reggae. “My album is radical and portrays women as dominant forces in society. It emphasised that they’re not damsels in distress,” she said. She has worked with different producers to add different sounds and flavours. “I teamed up with House of Riddim from Australia, and they brought elements of life classic reggae roots,” she said. It also features versatile rhythm by Cure Massive from Zimbabwe. Locally, she worked with Lavoro Duro for a fresh flavour. Tsoseletso is on cloud nine to be nominated for this year’s SAMA27 in the categories Best Newcomer, Best Reggae Album and Best Female of the Year. She said her nominations showed that doors were opening for women in reggae. “It’s also the answer to my prayers – that I am finally being recognised in my art craft,” said Tsoseletso.
