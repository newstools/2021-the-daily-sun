THEY prayed for former president Jacob Zuma during happy times, and they will continue to do the same during these challenging times. Bishop Vusi Dube of Ethekwini Community Church said he went to Nkandla to pray for Zuma because he prayed for him even in happy times. “I came here because the word of God doesn’t teach us to abandon people when they are faced with troubles. The word of God teaches us that we pray during happy times and difficult times,” said Dube. Also an ANC member of provincial legislature, Dube said he went to Nkandla as a faith leader and to deliver comfort. “Zuma visits my church regularly and I’ve prayed for him many times before. I won’t abandon him just because he is facing difficulty.”  Dube said that they stood with Zuma even during his rape case, and would continue even now. Zionist Bishop Bheki Ngcobo said as much as they would continue to pray for Zuma, they also pleaded for him to do the right thing, and spare the bloodshed and war. He said Zuma was a father of the nation, and inspired leaders for upcoming generations. That’s why they appealed to him to take a big step and save South Africa from embarrassment. “As the nation, we will keep him in our prayers and fast through his tough journey. His decision will make him prominent, respected and supported by people of South Africa,” said Ngcobo. He added that no matter what happened, they would continue to pray for him, even if he were in jail.
