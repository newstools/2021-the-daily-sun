POLICE are looking for more than 30 suspects involved in a cash-in-transit heist between the N17 offramp and N1 North freeway. Colonel Athlenda Mathe said the incident took place on the evening of Monday, 5 July after a group of G4S security guards collected money from a bank in Ormonde, Joburg. “The security personnel were travelling towards a branch in Krugersdorp when they were cornered and attacked.”  Mathe explained that during the ordeal, the suspects started shooting randomly at the armoured vehicle and the two armoured bakkies escorting the cash van. She said all the security personnel were forced out of their vehicles to lie down on the side of the road. The cash van was then bombed and an undisclosed amount of money was stolen.  Mathe said the suspects were allegedly travelling in eight vehicles, of which a Mercedes Benz, Jeep and Toyota Fortuner were burned.  “Cases opened include cash-in-transit heist, armed robbery and attempted murder. Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen what transpired or have information about this case to come forward and assist investigations.”
