 FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s supporters gathered at the gate of his Nkandla home on Wednesday night just hours before the police were expected to arrest him. As the clock ticked and it was less than an hour before the three days cops had to arrest him lapsed, an ambulance was turned away by his supporters at the gate. The supporters could be heard saying: “Zuma is not sick and is going nowhere.” [WATCH] surprisingly, an ambulance has just arrived at the homestead of the ex-president. However members of the disbanded #MKMVA and Zuma supporters are refusing that it enters inside. #ZumaArrest @News24 “Zuma is not sick and is going nowhere” they say.
