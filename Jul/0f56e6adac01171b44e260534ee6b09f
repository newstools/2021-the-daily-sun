KAIZER Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter has heaped praise on his Al Ahly counterpart, Pitso Mosimane, ahead of the Caf Champions League final clash. Chiefs will be hoping to end their fairytale story historically by clinching their first-ever Champions League title, but they will need to be at their best to make that ambition becomes a reality. The blockbuster between these two sides will take place at Mahamed V Stadium in Morocco (9pm, SA time). Heading to this clash, Baxter, who will be on the bench for the first time since re-joining Amakhosi, said Mosimane deserves respect but explained how Amakhosi have prepared to stand a chance of denying the Egyptian heavyweights their tenth title. "I have great respect for Pitso (Mosimane) as a coach and we have had very many interesting battles and I have to say that on the night, I do not think the experience amassed in the past will affect the game." Baxter went on: "Every game has more than one scenario. My knowledge in football is that things do not turn out the way you think. We have a good plan to help us win the game. "Great respect for Pitso and Al Ahly but for the evening we have more than one solution on the way to ensure the game resolves itself. We obviously believe we can get a positive result." The defending champions defeated Esperance de Tunis 4-0 on aggregate to make it to the final, while on the other hand, Amakhosi defeated Wydad Casablanca 1-0 on aggregate to advance.
