RICHARDS Bay defender Austin Dube is set to be announced as a Kaizer Chiefs player, according to information reaching SunSport. Dube has been tracked by Chiefs following his brilliant performances for the Natal Rich Boyz last season in the GladAfrica Championship, where he helped the club finish third and reach the promotion/relegation play-offs. The 28-year-old started and finished all 30 matches and scored five league goals in a process. He showed his deadly touch from set-pieces against Chiefs to break their hearts, as Simo Dladla’s side knocked Amakhosi out in the first round of the Nedbank Cup at FNB Stadium in February. “Dube is joining Chiefs after the end of Cosafa Cup,” said an insider. Dube, who is the left footed player, was part of the Bafana Bafana side in the Cosafa Cup that was held in the Eastern Cape, which ended yesterday. In this regional international tournament, Dube has been involved in all Bafana’s group matches, which reached the final without conceding a goal for Morena Ramoreboli’s side, who is the caretaker coach in this competition. The former TS Galaxy defender will become the sixth signing for Chiefs in this transfer window. Others players who have joined the Soweto giants at Naturena are Brandon Peterson, Njabulo Ngcobo, Sifiso Hlanti, Kgaogela Sekgota, Phathutshedzo Nange, Sibusiso Mabiliso.
