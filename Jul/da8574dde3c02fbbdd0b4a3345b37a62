The SABC will now broadcast the CAF Champions League final between Kaizer Chiefs and Egyptian giants Al Ahly in Morocco on Saturday. Earlier on Friday, the public broadcaster released a statement expressing disappointment that the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has given broadcasting giant SuperSport the exclusive rights. Amakhosi face the Egyptian giants on Saturday in their first-ever Champions League final at the Mohamed V Stadium (21:00 SA time).The Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams confirmed that the SABC will broadcast the CAF Champions League final live on SABC television and radio platforms. According to SABC's press release, the minister engaged with both the SABC and Multichoice to "ensure an amicable resolution on the acquisition of the rights in the interests of the broad African public"."I would like to thank both the SABC and Multichoice for reaching a solution that will benefit millions of soccer loving South Africans. Sports plays an instrumental role in nation building and social cohesion," said Ndabeni-Abrahams."It is for this reason that I welcome this agreement between the two organisations. The people of our country will now be able to watch this crucial game on a free-to-air platform. This is particularly important as our country is going through a difficult time."Meanwhile, MultiChoice noted SABC's disappointment and stated that there had been factually incorrect remarks made on the organisation. pic.twitter.com/Zpsjhn2mNU
