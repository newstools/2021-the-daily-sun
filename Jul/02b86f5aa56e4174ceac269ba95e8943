ACTRESS Petronella Tshuma has opened up about being a single mother. The actress, who recently broke up with the father of her second child about a year ago, took to Instagram to share her experience of raising two young boys alone. “Nearly a year ago Camagu’s dad and I split up. Was that ever the plan? Of course not. So here I am a mother to two beautiful boys with different fathers. Who would ever want to be with me again? Am I used goods. I must have been the problem, right? My lobola price will probably cost pocket change,” she said. The actress, who plays Pearl on Rhythm City, said she had breakdowns at work after the break-up. “I could not act. Lines would not stick. But here I am, a single mum with two kids that I need to provide for. Rhythm City, my amazing family were understanding. Gave me time and the greatest support. Offered and would pay for therapy. I did not go because I then got the news that the show was being cancelled. I remember saying to my cast members ‘how will I look after my children?’ ALSO READ | PRESENTER SHOCKED BY LIVE AMP CANCELLATION My children are the only people on this earth that have witnessed all my colours. The good and the bad. The beautiful and the ugly. And yet, for some reason I am the world and more to them,” But above all, Petronella said being a mother is the best gift she has ever been blessed with and with such comes great responsibility. The actress, who got her big break 10 years ago when she auditioned for Class Act in front of Rapulana Seiphemo, James Ngcobo and Moonyeenn Lee, went down memory lane and recalled a moment when she was asked what else she is good at besides acting and she responded and said: “All Im good at, is being a mum. And during it all, I’m continuously finding myself. That beautiful little girl I did not know existed. I filled everyone else’s cups including the characters I would play and have nothing left to give myself. Self-work is not for the fainted-hearted. It is gritty but rewarding.
