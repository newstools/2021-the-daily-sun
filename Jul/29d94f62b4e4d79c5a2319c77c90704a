DJ PH Madubela has scored his own TV show. He told SunBuzz the Channel O show The Next Level had been in the pipeline for a long time. “Initially, the show was meant to start airing at the beginning of June, but due to technical problems it didn’t. I’m wearing more of an executive producing cap with the show as it is my brainchild,” he said. The DJ said the show was launching just at the right time as the newly-adjusted level 4 Covid-19 regulations were hitting artists hard. “The show came at the right time, and I’m happy that some people in the industry will get to work. Every Friday we have three artists who perform and we profile a new DJ who plays a set,” he said. PH said he’d not be making too many appearances on screen as he wanted to give up-and-coming artists a chance to shine and show off their talents. “I will play now and again, but my primary focus is on directing, floor managing and just giving other young people a chance,” he said. “I have three interns coming to work on the production and all of them are women. That is something I’m excited about.” He said the show was a way to celebrate local talent while also giving people a chance to pursue their dreams. “Whether it’s in production or on screen, I want to ensure that nobody who wants to work on any of these platforms is left behind,” he said.
