BAFANA Bafana have maintained their positive start to the COSAFA Cup. They bagged their second win of the campaign, beating ten men Eswatini 1-0 at the Isaac Wolfson Stadium on Thursday. Thabang Sibanyoni scored the only goal of the match to send Morena Ramoreboliâ€™ charges to the top of Group A. They have a perfect record of two wins from as many matches and have amassed six points. They beat Botswana by the same scoreline in the opener which was played at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday. The quasi-Bafana side has been ravaged by Covid-19 with their coach Helman Mkhalele and goalkeeper coach Lucky Shiburi among those missing out after testing positive. The pair are currently isolating and it remains to be seen if they will rejoin the camp post isolation. But in the meantime, Ramoreboli continues to lead the depleted side on the touchline. The former Bloemfontein Celtic assistant coach has had to work with a limited squad as players pulled out due to a combination of Covi-19 and other commitments. Ramoreboli, for a second match running, only had two outfield players on the bench in Yusuf Maart and Sibanyoni. Nevertheless, Bafana still managed to walk away victorious. Their opponents, Eswatini, remain in the second spot with three points despite their defeat to the hosts. They had to play the entire second half with ten men after their skipper, TS Galaxy midfielder Felix Badenhorst was sent off in the first half. Lesotho are in third place after they pulled off a shock win over Zambia who are rooted to the bottom of the group standings. Lesotho will be hoping to pull off yet another shock when they face Bafana in their next match set to take place at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday (3pm). Eswatini next faces Chipolopolo at the same venue on Saturday.
