OVER R3 million Remington Gold illicit cigarettes were seized by police being smuggled into South Africa in a bus. The incident took place at the Beitbridge Border Post in Musina, Limpopo on Friday, 9 July. This follows a tip-off about a bus with a trailer carrying illicit cigarettes in the vicinity of the border. The bus was spotted and routinely directed to the searching bay. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the police together with customs officials started searching the trailer and found 239 master boxes of Remington Gold illicit cigarettes and 35 cartoons worth over R3 million. “Two foreign suspects aged 30 and 63 were immediately arrested and the third one managed to evade arrest. The search for the escaped suspect is still continuing. The fight against the smuggling of illicit cigarettes continues. The suspects were stopped in their tracks, allegedly smuggling large consignment of illicit cigarettes into the country,” said Mojapelo. The suspects will appear in the Musina Magistrates Court on Monday, 12 July for possession of illicit cigarettes. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe applauded the police for swiftly responding to the information provided and arresting the suspects. “I also thank community members for continuously assisting the police in the fight against crime,” she said.
