TINYIKO Ndlovu is one of the people killed in a stampede during the looting at Ndofaya Mall in Meadowlands, Soweto, on Monday, 12 July. Noluthando Ndlovu (48), who has been raising the 14-year-old following her mother’s death when she was still a toddler, told Daily Sun she was still struggling to come to terms with her niece’s death. She described Tinyiko as a bubbly and jolly teen who never stayed angry for long. But on Monday afternoon, Noluthando received a call that Tinyiko was spotted dead at the mall. “We drove with other family members to the mall. “Along the way, I hoped and prayed they were mistaken. But sadly, it was Tinyiko,” said Noluthando. “In disbelief and confusion, I tried to wake her up. I kept shaking her. Several other bodies were next to hers, and all I could do was cry. My bubbly Tinyiko is gone, but only God knows why. “I have been raising her as my daughter and she referred to me as her mother. I’m shattered,” she said. Noluthando believed Tinyiko was at the wrong place at the wrong time. “I don’t know what happened and what she was doing at the mall during the looting. But she is not a thief. “She was with her friends throughout the afternoon. “She left the house in good spirits after finishing her chores.” Noluthando said Tinyiko was raised well and had everything she needed. “I’m not working, but my children have good jobs and they’ve always made sure we have everything we need. “We have a roof over our heads and have never gone to bed on an empty stomach.” Tinyiko’s aunt, Zukizwa Khumalo, (41) said: “With schools being closed, children are bored at home and roam the streets. “Tinyiko was a well-behaved teenager and she wouldn’t have gone to the mall to steal.” On Tuesday, 13 July, NatJOINTS recorded 45 deaths relating to the looting around Gauteng since the beginning of the unrest.
