MUCH-loved brand, Adidas has collaborated with two of South Africa’s most fashion forward designers, Rich Mnisi and Thebe Magugu. The pair will headline the 2021 Pride collection for its Love Unites campaign. According to Adidas, the collection will include pieces spanning across style and performance wear. The expansive collection looks to hero a “Do It Yourself” (DIY) visual aesthetic born from the LGBTQ+ communities who had sought to create their own spaces for self-expression. To add a local flare to the campaign, Rich and Thebe recreated the Love Unites campaign to tell the story of sport culture in the lens of South African allies and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Speaking to Daily Sun, Rich said: “Heteronormativity from professional sports to children’s athletics has been seen as the typical model in sport culture. “I reimagined this Pride collection by celebrating queer personalities who exist in sport today such as dancer Lebo Otukile, rugby player Soala Amabeoku and soccer player and coach, Mpumi Nyandeni.” Thebe expressed his excitement about the campaign.

More queer athletes are running, shooting hoops, and kicking stereotypes with pride than ever before. “In sport, like everyday life, cultivating passion begins with love. As queer athletes leap over stereotypes and break boundaries. Let their passion inspire you to wear your heart on your sleeve and stand with pride.” Thebe’s reimagined pride collection features models Lethabo Gailele, Monray Louw and Chalé Darwin. The 2021 “Love Unites” collection is available now at adidas.co.za and at adidas stores.
