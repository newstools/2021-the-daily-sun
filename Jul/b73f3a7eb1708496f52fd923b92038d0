A driver of a McLaren 720S that costs about R7,5 million has been hospitalised after crashing the supercar on a highway. The incident happened on 7 July in Singapore. The dashcam of a nearby car captured the entire crash on film. In the video, the 720S can be seen travelling along the left lane of the highway when the driver aggressively swerves to the right. The British supercar then slams into the centre median of the road and flies into the air. Carscoops reports that it is hard to know why the 42-year-old driver of the McLaren veered across the road in the way that he did.
