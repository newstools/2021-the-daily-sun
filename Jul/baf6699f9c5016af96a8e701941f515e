NPO HOUSE of Siza is celebrating the late sangoma Credo Mutwa. The organisation will remember the legend by hosting a webinar celebrating his centenary today, Wednesday, 21 July, where it will be presenting Credo Mutwa ‘mentaries’ (documentaries) and a truversation celebrating the year of arts, culture and heritage in Afrika. The truversation with elders, academics and thinkers such as Siza Nkosi, Advocate Sipho Mantula, Thabo Lehlongwa, Menzi Maseko and others will create a platform for pan-African stories, poems and documentaries about mkhulu Mutwa’s spiritual and cultural life. According to the organisers, these will promote inter-generational tru-versations and conversations about the preservation of mkhulu’s life and legacy and advocate for the intellectual property rights of his work and extended family.
