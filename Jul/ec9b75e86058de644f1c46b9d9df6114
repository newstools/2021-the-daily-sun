“Stay at home and wash your hands regularly!” That’s the message we’ve been hearing throughout lockdown. That is the reason we tirelessly continue to ask government these questions: how do our communities stay at home while their taps are dry? How do they practise safe hygiene? Which one is more endangering to the community? Addressing a crowd during lockdown, for which Carl Niehaus was arrested for, or the shutdown of basic necessities like water? Please stop insulting our intelligence. Urgent arrests should be for those who, through the looting of funds for water supply, violated human rights by denying communities water. Siyabuswa
