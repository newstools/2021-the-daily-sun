SUPERSPORT United are in talks to extend the contract of veteran defender Bongani Khumalo. The former Bafana Bafana captain’s contract with the Tshwane giants expired on Wednesday. Khumalo, who won three league titles with SuperSport between 2007 and 2010, will train with the club which was one of the first teams to report back for their pre-season camp. “We are engaged in discussions with SuperSport regarding his contract,” confirmed his agent Glyn Binkin.“He will continue training with the club. As always, he is fully committed to the club on and off the field as the club has been a large part of his life and career.” SuperSport received their record fee for Khumalo of £1.5 million  (worth about R30m today) when he signed for English Premiership giants Tottenham Hotspur in January 2011. But that dream move to England turned into a nightmare for Khumalo as he never played a single EPL match for Spurs. He was loaned out to Preston, Reading, Doncaster Rangers, Colchester United and Greek club PAOK Salonika before Spurs released him in August 2015. He re-joined SuperSport for the 2015-16 season. However, he left the club in the second half of that season to join Bidvest Wits, reuniting with coach Gavin Hunt, with whom he won those three league trophies at the Tshwane giants. In the following season, he won a fourth league title with Wits. He also helped Wits win the Telkom Knockout in the 2016-17 season. He left Wits at the end of the 2017-18 season to rejoin SuperSport. But in three seasons with SuperSport, Khumalo has hardly featured and last season played only 19 games in all competitions. SuperSport have spoken about keeping him on board to help the club’s marketing department after he finally hangs up his boots.
