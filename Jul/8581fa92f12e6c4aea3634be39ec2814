COPS in the Western Cape are investigating the murders and attempted murders, which were in all probability caused by incidents of taxi violence. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said in Bukwayo Road in Harare, Khayelitsha, two people were shot and killed. “In Mew way, a 42-year-old man was shot and wounded while an unknown man, believed to be a taxi driver, was transported to a nearby hospital after sustained a gunshot wound,” said Swartbooi. Near Sara Baartman, a taxi driver sustained gunshot wounds to both legs. In Delft South, a driver of a retail business was dropping off employees when he was stopped but he sped off. “The suspects fired numerous gunshots at the vehicle, wounding a male and two female occupants. They were transported to a nearby hospital for medical treatment,” he said. Swartbooi said the suspects in all the cases fled and are yet to be arrested. “Harare police are investigating two murder and two attempted murder cases, while in Delft police are investigating a case of murder and four cases of attempted murder,” he added. Additional police resources have been sent to the areas affected by the violence and will remain on high alert while detectives pursue leads to apprehend those responsible. Anyone who can assist with information is kindly requested to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111. In Nyanga, passengers had to run for their lives after hearing gunshots. No one was injured or shot, but commuters had to walk to Nyanga Police Station to catch buses. A resident said when they heard the gunshots, they ran for their lives. The Golden Arrow buses were operating next to Nyanga cop shop because the bus company was told to go out of the Nyanga Terminus Rank. Last week, seven people were shot dead in the taxi violence.
