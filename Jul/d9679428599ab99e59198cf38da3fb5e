BAFANA Bafana’s stand-in coach for the ongoing COSAFA Cup, Morena Ramoreboli, has praised his side for their bright start to the competition. The quasi-Bafana team edged Botswana 1-0 in their opener played at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday. Kagiso Malinga came off the bench to score the solitary goal and hand Bafana the all-important three points. The result sent Bafana into second place on the Group A standings behind Eswatini who beat Lesotho 3-1 in their clash. The two sides will next meet on Thursday as they do battle for the top spot. Ramoreboli, who was on the bench in the absence of coach Helman Mkhalele, was pleased with what he saw from his charges under the circumstances. Bafana have struggled with Covid-19 with Mkhalele and some players forced to miss the tournament. They had a depleted squad ahead of their opener and only had three substitutes on the bench. But they got the job done regardless. “Credit to the boys,” said Ramoreboli. “I think it was important for them to win this match but it was not easy. We did not have the best of preparations but the boys were prepared to go out there and fight for the country and die for the course. “I think coach Helman has done a great job with how we prepared the team; it was easy for me to adapt to how he wants the team to play because we have been working together. The boys are happy after such a great performance. “I think we can grow and improve as the tournament goes on because we never even had enough players on the bench because of a number of reasons. But that will not be the case in our next match, we should have enough players on the bench. “The boys did everything to go and win the match regardless of the problems we have had. We just hope that they can be consistent now and keep fighting for positive results going forward.”
