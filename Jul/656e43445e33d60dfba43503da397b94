Rushine De Reuck wants to leave an ever lasting legacy in the Bafana Bafana set-up. The Mamelodi Sundowns defender tasted success in the national  team for the first time by lifting the Cosafa Cup trophy following a 5-4 penalties win over Senegal at the weekend following a goalless draw. This is sweet victory for the 25-year-old as he was given the responsibility of leading the team by wearing the armband. Said De Reuck: “I am happy to win the Cosafa Cup. We have a big responsibility to do well for the country, and I am happy we managed to make the fans proud. It’s a great feeling and that winning mentality started at Sundowns. I felt that we took that to the national team. That’s what we want to leave a lasting legacy.” The former Maritzburg United defender says he is proud that they were solid in defence as they kept a clean sheet in six matches. “I am still new in the national team and I am embracing the new role of captain and I have done quiet well because I needed to step up to try and lead from the back. We did well because we kept six clean sheets and I am very happy about that.” However, De Reuck revealed that it was not easy to adapt into the national team. “It wasn’t easy because after we won the league I went straight to Bafana, spent a few days at home and back into camp again. It wasn’t easy, but as footballers we want to be part of that environment, so we can’t complain. Obviously, I am tired, but it was worth it for me to win the trophy.
