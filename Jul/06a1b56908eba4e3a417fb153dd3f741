HE regrets taking part in the looting at Makro in Springfield, KZN on Monday, 12 July after being shot three times by the cops. Now the 30-year-old from Kwa Mashu J section near Durban can’t help but thank his ancestors the cops used rubber bullets. “I would be at the mortuary if they had used live ammunition. I also managed to run away from going to jail,” he said. The man told Daily Sun he was home sleeping when people looted KwaMashu Centre on Sunday, 11 July. He was woken up by his friend who asked him to hide his looted goods. He did so, but his friend came back three more times. He said he was tempted to join when he heard people were looting Makro in Springfield on Monday. “I asked my friend to go with them and I managed to grab two TV plasmas. Cops shot me three times from a distance when I was running to the car. I dropped the plasma and ran for my life.” He said he was shot twice in the arm and once in the stomach. “I can see my ancestors are against crime. They don’t want me to commit crime. “All my friends survived doing crime, but I didn’t. I was only tempted that day, but was the only one injured.” He has learned a hard lesson. “I regret going there. My arm is swollen and the pain is killing me, but I fear going to the clinic. All I have are pain killers.”
