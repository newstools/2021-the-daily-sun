 AL Ahly have clinched their historic tenth Caf Champions League title! The Egyptian Red Devils outclassed Kaizer Chiefs, beating them 3-0 at Mohammed V Stadium in Morocco on Saturday night. The victory was historic for the club and for their coach Pitso Mosimane who has now won three Caf Champions league titles. He is the only South African coach to achieve that feat. He won his first in 2016 with Mamelodi Sundowns. His second title was when he joined Ahly last season, and now he has successfully defended the title.Chiefs suffered a major setback just before half-time when midfielder Happy Mashiane was sent off for a reckless challenge on Akram Tawfik.Initially deemed worthy of only a yellow card, the referee changed his decision after consulting the VAR monitor, and he reversed his decision and gave Mashiane marching orders.It was just a matter of time in the second half until Ahly started dominating the match as Amakhosi were one man down.The first goal duly arrived on 53 minutes, with Tawfik playing a superb through ball to pick out the intelligent run of Mohamed Sherif, who then provided a superb finish past Akpeyi to make it 1-0.The second goal arrived just over 10 minutes later, with a mistake at the back from Chiefs allowing Mohamed Magdi Kafsha to exchange passes on the edge of the penalty area before firing an unstoppable shot into the back of the net via the inside of Akpeyi’s left-hand upright.Amr El Soulia scored the third on 74 minutes, whipping home from a back-heel set-up by Sherif as Ahly turned on the style against an increasingly ragged Amakhosi, putting the cherry on top, for now, 10-time African champions.Ahly will now face new Confederation Cup champions Raja Casablanca in the 2021-22 CAF Super Cup.
