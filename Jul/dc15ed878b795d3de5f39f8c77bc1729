RESIDENTS
from KwaMashu Hostel said they’ve become the number one suspects of the riots
and looting that took place in the area. They
said they are also suspected of having started the tension between Indians and
Africans that began during the looting and destruction of property in Phoenix. They
are not happy that when cops started searching for the looted goods, they began
at their hostel. Following
the allegations of looting, the leadership of the IFP in KZN met KwaMashu
Hostel dwellers at Rotary Stadium to call for calm and peace. The
hostel dwellers came out in large numbers and filled the stadium to its
capacity. A
resident told Daily Sun that all these allegations against them were not true. “There
are respected people who live here. We were never involved in any looting, but
cops made their first stop here,” he said. Another
resident said they were aware that the hostel was known for killings, but not
everyone who lives there is a  criminal. “We’ve
become number one suspects. The police come here with big guns and demanded
receipts of our appliances and furniture as if we were looting,” he said. Ward
Councillor Sandile Gwala informed the IFP leadership that the residents weren’t
happy. He
said the leadership would meet the ministers and the matter would be addressed. Addressing
the hostel dwellers, IFP KZN chairman Thami Ntuli said they were concerned
about the incidents that took place and they decided to come to the hostel to
call for calm. He
said it pains them that a lot of people died. “We
stand with you even in hard times. All we want is peace and harmony. People
know that if they are not happy about a party they can vote for someone else,”
he said. After
the address at Rotary Stadium, the leadership  moved to Duffs Road where
they also met the residents.
