RESIDENTS from Khuma and Jouberton near Klerksdorp in the North West are tired of living with the bad kak smell. They even contacted Daily Sun to complain about the smell, saying they feared for their health, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. They said sewage spilling from the main holes kept flooding their streets and got inside their yards. The municipality agreed there was a problem, but said some residents were the ones who kept causing the problem. Matlosana municipal spokeswoman Ntswaki Makhetha said: “There has been illegal processing of gold sand by illegal miners in Khuma near the old hostel, which blocks the sewer pipe line. So their piles of soil were removed, but they continued.” She said in Jouberton, sewage blockages were caused by stones and clothes found inside the pipe lines. Four main holes were damaged. “Pipes are in good condition. The abuse of the sewer system is the main challenge we mentioned. Flushing of clothes, throwing of stones into main holes and damages of pipes done by road construction, which does not check underground pipes with our relevant departments, is also a challenge.” Asked about the solution, she said: “An advertisement is under evaluation for a contractor to be appointed and fix the problem.”
