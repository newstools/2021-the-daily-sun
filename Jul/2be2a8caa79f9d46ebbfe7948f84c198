AWARD-WINNING actor Clint Brink recently opened up about his health struggles. He shared that he suffered from psoriasis, a skin condition where cells built up and formed scales and itchy, dry patches. Left untreated, the condition can be life threatening. Clint said he started to itch three weeks ago, but did not take it seriously. “It started in the arm as a minor itch. I thought I was allergic to something and didn’t pay much attention to it. But it got worse, became terribly itchy and started to look like blisters.” He contacted a doctor, who recommended immediate medical help.

I’m currently doing oxygen therapy and it is helpful. “I want to assure people I’m not dying and I feel better. I’m assuring them because we’ve been dealing with so many RIPs lately.” Clint told Daily Sun he was working on a few projects. “I’m one of the few lucky ones who are still able to work during the pandemic. “One of the projects includes a feature film that I started four years ago, and will be completed before the end of the year. “Unfortunately, I can’t disclose much at this point,” Clint said.
