COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc on the Bafana Bafana camp. This after two more members of the team tested positive in the latest round of testing ahead of the knockout stages. Physiotherapist Nhlanhla Ndlovu and player Masilakhe Phohlongo are the affected members. The pair will now go into quarantine and will miss the remainder of the tournament. Bafana team doctor, Tshepo Molobi, said he could not determine how the pair might have been infected inside the bubble. “It becomes extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly where the infection came from,” said Molobi. “What we have always done is to mitigate against the spread and that is what we have been doing all along. “So, at this point, it would be disingenuous of me to allude to the infection having come from this point or that point.” Covid has wreaked havoc on Bafana as they had to withdraw some players leading up to the tournament after they returned positive tests. On the eve of the tourney, head coach Helman Mkhalele and goalkeeper coach Lucky Shiburi also tested positive and had to go into isolation. The pair have finally been cleared to de-isolate but are unlikely to be reintegrated into the setup. Phohlongo, the only player who tested positive, is now set to miss Bafana’s semi-final against Mozambique at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Friday (2pm). He will also be unavailable for the final on Sunday should Bafana get past the Mambas. “What happens now is that they will have to isolate, as was the case with the two coaches before,” added Molobi.
