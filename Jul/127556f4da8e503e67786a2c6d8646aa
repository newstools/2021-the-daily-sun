My sister then verified it and I cannot even begin to describe the pain I am feeling. “Not only was he a great musician, but he was also special. It is difficult to find people like him in our industry, who did not allow their circumstance to define them. He went to school and went on to become an advocate. He wanted to advance his life, making him one of the greatest role models in music and academia,” Hotstix said.
