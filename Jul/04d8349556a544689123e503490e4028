TWO cops in Cape Town are in hot water after they kidnapped and detained an innocent person following the escape of a housebreaking suspect. According to police spokesman Captain Frederick Van Wyk, the incident happened on 29 May this year. He said two cops arrested a man for housebreaking in the Maitland area but realised that he needed some medical help. Van Wyk said they rushed him to Somerset Hospital for treatment. “The members took the suspect to Somerset Hospital, Sea Point for treatment. A 34-year-old constable was left at the hospital to guard the suspect. While at the hospital the suspect escaped. The constable informed the 44-year-old warrant officer of the escaping on his return to the hospital. The members drove around the area looking for the suspect but could not find him.” As a way to cover-up the escape, they returned to the Maitland area and found another person on the street whom they took to Maitland Police Station and detained him in the place of the suspect. “They did not inform anyone of what had happened. It was only the next day, when the suspect was processed, that the detective realised that the person does not fit the description of the person who was originally arrested. The matter was referred to the Anti-Corruption Unit for investigation,” said Van Wyk. He said that at the completion of the investigation, the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Western Cape decided to charge the members. The magistrate at Cape Town Magistrates Court authorised warrants of arrest for their arrests. The two cops were arrested on Friday, 16 July and are expected to appear in court on Monday, 19 July on charges of kidnapping and defeating the administration of justice.
