Actress Pearl Thusi has raised eyebrows with her Instagram photos. The black and white photos are of half naked women. Her Instagram followers had mixed reactions as some felt she was bringing them illuminati. Patekway commented: “Pearl, what are we looking at? Giving us Illuminati vibes here. This is creepy. Is has some ritualistic undertones.” “It’s definitely weird,” said Off Guard Sniper. Mercy lasauce said: “She did not get hacked. She’s showing her dark side.” “Looks like some dark art. The message is hidden in the character,” said Azwi Nefale But some of her followers defended her, saying it was a form of art. Ricky Rocardo said: “Understand what the message is by looking at the pictures. Not only is it art but it also tells a story. Look at it from an artistic point of view. It might not be to everyone’s taste or understanding. It’s what I call freedom of expression, and the fact that the piece is called The Last Supper makes it even more interesting.” A post shared by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi)
