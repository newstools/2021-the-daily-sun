SUSPENDED ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule has lost his
challenge to overturn his suspension as the full bench of the South Gauteng
High Court dismissed his argument that his suspension was unlawful and
unconstitutional. The court held that the suspension was in line with the
constitution of the party and that the party’s constitution was consistent with
that of the country. Magashule also lost his bid to have the court declare the
ANC’s step aside rule as unlawful, unconstitutional, and invalid. In fact, Magashule lost on counts, including to have the
court validate his suspension of President Cyril Ramaphosa which he argued
should stand until it is fully nullified. The judgment was unanimous and read by Judge Jody Kollapen,
the matter of members who were facing corruption charges should step aside
weighed heavily on delegates at the 54th Nasrec national congress on how this
impacted the integrity of the party and its sustainability as a political
party. Arising out of this there was a general consensus that it
was time for more decisive action to deal with the scourge of corruption. “And that conference called for resolutions in essence that
dealt with the ANC attempts to deal with corruption,” said Kollapen, adding
that the argument that the national executive committee amended this resolution
should fail.
