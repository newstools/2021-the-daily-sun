TO all the doubters, relax... Who would have thought South Africans would behave in such barbaric manner and destroy the economy that they worked so hard to build over the years? The anarchy and nihilism that came out of South Africans over the past days must be castigated in the strongest possible terms, and repudiated. But what cannot be rejected is the strongest possibility of Kaizer Chiefs winning the Caf Champions League. There’s a 50/50 chance that Chiefs can beat Al Ahly at any given day, much as there’s a chance that the Red Devils can beat Amakhosi. Let’s treat each other fairly, please. With this, I think the sense of belief in our own is very important, and all the naysayers must be ignored up until the final whistle goes in Morocco, where Chiefs will be climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. Like Justice Sithole, former Chiefs winger, and Muhsin Ertugral said, who would have thought that the Naturena lads are capable of clawing their way back into the DStv Premiership top eight bracket? No one! But they are there. And again, who would have imagined Chiefs playing in the 2021 Caf Champions League final? No one, not even ex-coach Gavin Hunt or current acting coaches – Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard. But they are there and the whole country must rally behind them, I believe. Even Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane can attest to the world of possibilities, as he too didn’t believe his luck when his former club Mamelodi Sundowns won Africa’s premier club competition, Champions League in 2016. And when they won the Super Cup the following year then he realised that dreams do come true. Let’s not talk about his appointment as the Al Ahly coach last year... a world of opportunities for all who live in it. Let’s give Chiefs a chance and see what will transpire, for they are South Africans first, and the game of football is played equally by 11 players apiece. Good luck boys!
