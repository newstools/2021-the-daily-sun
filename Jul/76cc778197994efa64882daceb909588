Dear MizzB I’M a woman in her mid-30s who likes having sex. My boyfriend doesn’t always satisfy my needs. I’m thinking of having a sex partner so I don’t put too much pressure on my boyfriend. Will this work? Dear Sista Having a higher sex drive than your partner can be a challenge at times. Having a sex partner won’t necessarily solve all your problems. Like every arrangement, it has its pros and cons. It’s always best to openly talk to your partner about your desires and express how you feel. Involving other people in your sex life shouldn’t be a decision you take alone. Your boyfriend has every right to have a say and decide on what is best for him. Consider going for therapy or counselling as a couple for a way forward. Good luck!
