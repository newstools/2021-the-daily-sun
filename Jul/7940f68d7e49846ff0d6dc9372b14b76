ALLEGED taxi hitman Gwabo Mahlangu was denied bail by KwaMhlanga District Court on Wednesday, 14 July. The 28-year-old faces two charges of murder and one for attempted murder. The state prosecutor previously told the court that he faced schedule (6) offences. He will be back in court on 10 September for the start of his trial. The magistrate said the suspect only presented an affidavit as evidence. He said the suspect might face a lengthy sentence if found guilty. “In an affidavit the applicant presented to the court, he said he has three kids that depend on him. “He said he works as a taxi driver and earns R6 000 per month. He was never convicted of any offence before and there are no warrants of arrests issued out for him. He will not scare the witnesses and is not a flight risk. “He has also told the court he is not guilty and did not commit the crimes,” said the magistrate. He said the suspect’s life would be in danger if he was out on bail. “The community will not feel safe and is angry. The local taxi association is also protesting, opposing bail,” he said. Mahlangu allegedly shot and killed taxi marsha Oupa Manamela (39), at Miliva Taxi Rank on 1 March. He also allegedly killed a 42-year-old taxi boss at a traffic circle near the rank. He apparently shot and injured a taxi patrol vehicle driver at Moloto in the leg. Mahlangu was arrested on 29 April and was found with a licenced firearm and a silver grey VW Polo, suspected to have been used in the commission of the crimes.
