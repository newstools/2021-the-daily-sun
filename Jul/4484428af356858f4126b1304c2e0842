Stellenbosch FC have confirmed the departure of two more players ahead of the new season with midfielder Phathutshedzo Nange and Azeemud-Deen Brenner the latest to depart the Winelands side. Nange is expected to link up with Kaizer Chiefs for the new campaign, having been targeted by his former BidVest Wits coach Gavin Hunt. The latter’s departure from the Naturena side appears to have had no bearing on Nange’s future. Left-back Brenner arrived at Stellenbosch at the start of last season, but only managed two appearances all campaign. He previously played for Ubuntu Cape Town, where he was a regular and the Cape United in the 2019-20 season. Of slight concern for the 22-year-old is that he is now headed for a fourth club in as many years. Stellenbosch also announced the departure of right-back Kristopher Bergman earlier this week. They have yet to confirm any new arrivals. -SuperSport
