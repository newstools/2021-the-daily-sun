TS GALAXY have beefed up their defence by signing Uthongathi centre back Xolani Silawula. He left Uthongathi on Sunday alongside Ntsikelelo Nxadi, who is joining Golden Arrows with Saziso Magawana and Sibonelo Cele also from the Cane Cutters. At Galaxy, Silawula will replace veteran defender Bevan Fransman, who parted ways with the Mpumalanga club at the end of last season. Silawula will be the third player Galaxy has officially signed during the off season transfer window following the acquisition of Augustine Chidi Kwem from Chippa United and Sinethemba Mngomezulu also from Uthongathi. The 25-year-old, who joins on a free transfer, this will be the second time he’s playing in the top flight. He was signed by AmaZulu at the beginning of the 2018-19 season by then coach Cavin Johnson. But he struggled to break in the Usuthu line-up and the Durban-based club decided to loan him back to the Cane Cutters the following season before the move was made permanent. Meanwhile, Galaxy are linked to two Bosnia-Herzegovina internationals, centre back Igor Makitan and goalkeeper Vasilije Kolak, who are both 26, from FK Krupa. Both are set to arrive on a free transfer. Kolak featured in 29 matches in all competitions with six clean sheets for Krupa last season in what was his first season with the club. Defender Makitan played in 25 matches and scored once. Krupa finished 10th in the 12 team league. According to the reports in Bosnia, both players have been signed by Galaxy but club boss Tim Sukazi has yet to officially announce their signing. Club media officer Minenhle Mkhize said: “We will organise a press conference where we’ll reveal all our new signings.” Meanwhile, Mkhize added the players will return on Friday to start pre-season training for the 2021-22 DStv Premiership campaign.
