The Gauteng Department of Treasury has lost more than R6
million after it mistakenly paid for services in dollars instead of rand. The department erroneously paid $20 million instead of R20
million as per e-Government payment advice for the cost of Microsoft fees, DA
spokesperson Adriana Randall said. This saw more than R318 million debited from the
e-Government bank account. After the error was made, the provincial treasury
recalled the full amount from Microsoft, but R6 million was lost due to a
change in the exchange rate. Gauteng Finance and e-Government MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko
addressed the issue while responding to questions posed in the provincial
legislature, reported Times Live. Nkomo-Ralehoko reportedly said the department prepared a
payment advice document for the payment of Microsoft fees amounting to more
than R20 million. The department submitted the payment advice to the provincial
treasury, cash book and banking services for processing. The provincial treasury erroneously made the payment in
dollars instead of rand, as advised by the department, Nkomo-Ralehoko
reportedly said. The amount was reportedly successfully recalled in February. Nkomo-Ralehoko reportedly said the provincial treasury had
instituted an investigation. "While the DA welcomes the investigation into this
forex transaction, we believe that stronger action should have been taken, and
the official responsible for this should have been suspended immediately and
the money recouped from the official. "Consequence management is the only way in which errors
like these will not happen and will send a strong message to any government
official that is involved in negligence as seen at the e-Government
department," Randall said. News24 approached the provincial treasury for comment but
had not received a response at the time of publication. It will be added, once
received. SOURCE: NEWS24
