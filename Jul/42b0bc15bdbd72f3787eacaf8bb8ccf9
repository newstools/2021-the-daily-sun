We’re sick and tired of Zuma’s family and supporters. They made it very clear that locking former president Jacob Zuma up would cause bloodshed. After the big mess they’ve put our country in, they should be happy now. Our economy will take a century or more to recover. Let’s stop being dishonest by always blaming poverty and unemployment when we loot and destroy the country. People who drive fancy cars drove to the CBD to load stolen goods and our so-called political analysts blame unemployment. We can’t deny it has hit our country hard, but let’s not hide behind it to loot. Shame on all of you who are now sitting with stacks of stolen goods at the expense of your brothers and sisters who are now without jobs. All ethnic groups in Mzansi are equal. Not all of us are Zuma supporters. As for KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala asking the president to pardon Zuma, that’s nonsense! Let him serve his sentence.
