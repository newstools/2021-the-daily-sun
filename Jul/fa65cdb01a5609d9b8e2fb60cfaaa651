THE search is on for the next hopeful to take over the crown from Shudufhadzo Musida. The Miss South Africa Organisation has announced the top 30 contestants competing for the title, as well as how people can vote for their favourite to make it into the top 10. According to the organisation, this year’s top 30 is an impressive and diverse group. Among them are two medical doctors, an attorney, a commercial pilot, an environmental specialist, models, graduates and students. While some have started their own businesses, others run charity organisations. There is also the first transgender woman, Lehlogonolo Machaba from North West, to openly enter the pageant. There are also three contestants who have entered before. They are Kgothatso Dithebe, who was in the Top 5 in 2019, Olin Shae de la Cruz who was in the Top 15 last year and Top 26 in 2017 and Catherine Groenewald, who was in the Top 30 in 2019.
