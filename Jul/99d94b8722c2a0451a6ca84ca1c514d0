A Gqeberha attorney appeared in court for alleged fraud and theft on Monday, 5 July. The 46-year-old appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court on two counts of fraud and theft after allegedly stealing more than R200 000 from her clients’ trust funds. Prosecutor, Advocate Siebert Baartman, didn’t oppose bail, saying the attorney co-operated with the police in their investigation. She was released on warning and one of the conditions was for her to hand over control of her law firm’s trust bank account to an appointed person. The case was postponed to 2 August and it will be heard in the Port Elizabeth Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. According to NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakani, in 2013 the owner of Cougar Clothing instructed the accused to defend her in a civil matter instituted against her. In October 2017, the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court passed a judgment against Cougar Clothing and ordered the owner to pay an amount of R140 000 with interest. Ngcakani said: “It is alleged that on 12 March 2018, the owner deposited an amount of R50 000 into the accused’s trust account with the instruction that the money was to be paid over towards the judgment debt. It is alleged, however, that instead she misappropriated the R50 000.” Ngcakani said it was also alleged that on 13 November 2018, the owner deposited a further R100 000 into the trust account with the same instructions, but the accused only paid R20 000 the following month and “misappropriated the rest of the money”. Ngcakani said in June 2018, the attorneys who represented the complainant in the civil matter obtained a warrant of execution against the Cougar Clothing owner. On 1 February 2019, the Sheriff approached the owner of Cougar Clothing in order to attach her motor vehicle in terms of the warrant of execution. She informed the Sheriff that she instructed the accused to pay a total of R150 000 towards the judgment debt. “It then came to light that a sole payment of R20 000 had been made. Later on that same day, the accused then paid R50 000 towards the judgment debt leaving a balance of R80 000,” said Ngcakani. Another complainant on 7 February 2019 allegedly made a payment of R158 000 into the accused’s trust account. The payment of R150 000 was made for the purchase of a house, and R8 000 was for the transfer fees. “Contrary to the complainant’s instructions, the accused allegedly misappropriated R80 000 by paying it towards the judgment debt of Cougar Clothing,” Ngcakani said.
