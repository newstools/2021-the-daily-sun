IT’S not every day you get invited to a wedding and you end up doing hard labour. An unhappy wedding guest shared her shock at being told she had to wash up her own plate because the newlyweds were too tight on money to hire cleaners. The Reddituser was invited to a wedding at a “gorgeous and expensive” venue, only to find the cost of hosting the “beautiful ceremony” meant cutbacks in other areas. The woman was shocked to discover she and nine other guests had been tasked with washing up all the dirty dishes after the bride and groom chose to “self-cater” their wedding but failed to hire anyone to clean up the mess. According to The Mirror, she said: “The bride and groom blew most of their wedding money on the venue and the bride’s admittedly beautiful couture gown, so they decided to ‘self-cater’. “Whatever. Dinner is over, we are starting the reception thing, when the maid of honour starts coming around and asking some of us to come with her into the kitchen. We go. There is no AC so this kitchen is about a zillion degrees. She shows us stacks of plates and cups and then tells us we need to wash them.”
