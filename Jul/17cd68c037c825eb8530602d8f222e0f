The Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation in Bloemfontein, Free State arrested three suspects on Thursday, 15 July for theft, money laundering, uttering, and criminal gang activity which cost the government 12,8 million rands. The suspects are aged between 34 and 45. Hawks Spokesperson Captain Christopher Singo said their arrests originate from an incident that took place during December 2014 where the Department Of Rural Development and Land Affairs awarded a tender to the suspects to the estimated value of more than R6 million. It is alleged that the suspects submitted fraudulent company documents to bid for the awarded tender. The fraudulent documents submitted purported to the department that a joint venture exists between the suspects and the complainant whereas a joint venture agreement submitted was fraudulent and did not exist. "When the department requested document from the complainant to effect final payment on the project, it was discovered that a joint venture never existed and documents submitted were fraudulent. The matter was then reported to the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation for further investigation." Singo Said. He further indicates that during the investigation it was revealed a total amount of more than R12 million was paid to the suspects which led to their arrest in Queenstown, Butterworth and East London. The Provincial Head of Directorate For Priority Crime Investigation, Major General Kubandran Moodley, has commended the team for the successful investigation which led to the arrest of the suspects. The suspects are expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate court on Monday, 19 July.
