Bafana Bafana caretaker coach Morena Ramoreboli was over the moon after he led the team to the COSAFA Cup title. Bafana edged a dogged Senegal outfit 5-4 on penalties at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Gqeberha on Sunday. It wasn’t easy for Ramoreboli and his side as they had to overcome a tough schedule, injuries and Covid-19. The former Bloemfontein Celtic assistant coach, tough, had answers for every challenge the team faced throughout the tournament. In the end, Bafana would not be stopped as they charged to their fifth regional title and first since 2016. "It was not easy, but even those boys who were struggling with injuries, they had to continue fighting, they had to continue playing," said Ramoreboli. "I think they understood that they are no longer playing for any other thing except the badge, except for the country and they did that very well. I'm so excited, I'm happy. "Last year we managed to win it (COSAFA Under-17 Championship) with under-17s and here we are again with Bafana today. It's a great achievement. It is through hard work and the support we got from the association, it made things very easy for us. "In football we have what we called tactical endurance. We had to rely on them to execute whatever we drilled, even under pressure and there was a stage where I kept on saying to them, 'let's play with our hearts' because I could see they were becoming tired. “But they had to remember, they can't give up and they had to go through extra-time with the same spirit."
