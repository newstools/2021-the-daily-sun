KAIZER Chiefs have finally arrived to Mzansi from Morocco. After their Caf Champions League where they lost 3-0 to Al
Ahly on Saturday, Amakhosi who were due to land in Mzansi on Monday couldnâ€™tcome
back. Their flight was delayed, and they only arrived back home on
Wednesday. According to brief report from the club, their chartered
plane had mechanical issues, and therefore, preventing them from traveling
back. The club then made another arrangements to fly commercially
which was successful as they landed in Mzansi on Wednesday morning.
