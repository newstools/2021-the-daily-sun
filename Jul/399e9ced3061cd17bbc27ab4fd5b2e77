AMAZULU management confirmed they will host a “serious” press conference next week to give details about the players they have signed and those whose contracts expired last week. This was disclosed by Usuthu president Sandile Zungu when he was asked about the future of Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala, who hardly featured last season with only one league start which came in the last game of last season against Maritzburg United. By then, AmaZulu were assured of second place in the DStv Premiership, which is their highest finish in the PSL era. Despite that game being deemed a formality, Shabba rolled back the years and was named Man of the Match. He showed his old form that was seen at Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana that made him a household name. However, Durban-businessman Zungu left the Siphesihle Maduna issue, whose contract with the club is rumoured to have expired, unaddressed. But SunSport has learnt he has signed a further two-year deal. “We are not worried. We think our plans are going very well. We will not only outline the future of Shabba and Maduna, but everything about the squad ahead of next season,” said Zungu. As revealed by SunSport, Usuthu extended the contract of strikers Lehlohonolo Majoro and Bongi Ntuli by giving them both two years extensions. However, defender Tsepo Masilela, who played second fiddle last season to Sibusiso Mabiliso, who has left the club to join Chiefs, has seen the club exercise the one year option on his contract. Masilela will have a new competitor at left-back as Usuthu have already signed Mxolisi Kunene from Maritzburg as well as Keagan Buchanan.
