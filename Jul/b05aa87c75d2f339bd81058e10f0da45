Springbok training has been suspended for Monday following a positive test in the squad. The players have been placed in preventative isolation prior to further PCR testing and a review of the testing data by the Medical Advisory Group (MAG).  Lood de Jager returned a positive outcome in scheduled testing and, because of his close contact with a number of squad members, the entire group has gone into isolation.  An update will be issued following the review by the MAG and the further testing.
