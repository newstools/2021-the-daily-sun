FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s rights were infringed when the Constitutional Court sent him to jail without a fair trial. This is the argument his lawyer, Advocate Dali Mpofu SC, made on Monday, 12 July. He said the court made a mistake and it must correct its decision. “A person aggrieved must approach a court and seek relief. It is on that basis that we have approached this court. What we are saying is that this court made fundamentally rescindable errors,” said Mpofu. Zuma (79) was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months in jail for contempt of court after failing to obey the order to appear before the Zondo Commission on 7 July.

Mpofu told the court the judgment was clear that the justices didn’t sentence Zuma because he disobeyed a court order, but because he attacked the judiciary. Justice Steven Majiedt reminded Mpofu that Zuma was not convicted for the insults, but for disobeying the court order. “I’m afraid that is absolutely not the case. We are told in more than five passages that what makes this case unique, extreme and unprecedented is because of attacks that were made by Zuma on the judiciary,” said Mpofu. The hearing continues.
