They say miracles do happen in life if you believe. "Congratulations to myself... thanks to the God of Mount Zion," was all that Junior Khanye posted on his social media pages, as he welcomes a set of new wheels. The former Kaizer Chiefs dribbling wizard took all and sundry by surprise when he posted himself with his brand new two-door BMW Mini Cooper TwinPower Turbo. The Daveyton born has turned his life around by becoming a social media football analyst, post his playing days. And his analysis has been appreciated by all who cared to listen to his iDiski football show with presenter Nkululeko, offering his previews, reviews and analysis of clubs, coaches and players alike. This must bring hope to many other former players that life is fair, but only if you try harder.
