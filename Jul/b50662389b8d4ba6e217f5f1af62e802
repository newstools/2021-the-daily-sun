PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa did not wilfully mislead parliament on the donations towards his campaign to become ANC president. Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane also had no authority to investigate the funding of his campaign. This was the ruling of the Constitutional Court read by Justice Chris Jafta. The majority judgment ruled Mkhwebane was wrong in fact and law in finding Ramaphosa had wilfully misled parliament when he answered a question about the donation. “In the inquiry into whether the president misled parliament, the evidence placed before the PP shows the president did not wilfully mislead parliament. The president did not wilfully and inadvertently mislead parliament because these two words cannot be used at the same time. It is either one or the other. “In fact, Mmusi Maimane did not have his facts correct when he asked the question in 2018,” Jafta said. The donations first came to light in parliament when then DA leader Mmusi Maimane asked Ramaphosa if he was aware of a R500 000 donation to his campaign by Bosasa. Initially, Ramaphosa denied the donation saying the money was paid to his son, Andile, who had business dealings with the company. He later withdrew this statement in a letter to National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise and conceded that indeed it was a donation to his campaign. The court found Ramaphosa had not personally benefited from the campaign and Mkhwebane was informed campaign donors were told they should not expect any favours. “It cannot be said the president used the EFG2 account trust to enrich himself and his son. Both the president and his son knew about the donation. The evidence on record is that the president did not have any influence on the account,” said Jafta. The court further ruled Ramaphosa had no control over the campaign funds.
