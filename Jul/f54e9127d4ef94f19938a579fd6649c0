A Limpopo man accused of stealing booze from a local bottle store in Nkomo Village outside Giyani, Limpopo, has paid for his alleged sins with his life. But the same group that attacked the man later looted booze from the same store they accused the man of stealing from. Jabu Shilubane (38) was assaulted and burnt to death in broad daylight at a local soccer field on Tuesday, 13 July. His car was also torched after the attack. Jabu, who is believed to be originally from Nkowankowa outside Tzaneen, was living in Giyani section F. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said Jabu was apparently spotted by the residents who blocked the road, pulled him out of his vehicle and drove it to the nearby sports ground. “They then allegedly started assaulting him and later burnt him to death. They thereafter allegedly looted the liquor store and also torched the deceased’s motor vehicle. The owner of the liquor outlet later opened a case of business burglary,” Mojapelo said. He said the police were investigating cases of murder, malicious damage to property and business burglary. Provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe, condemned the incident and warned residents to stop taking the law into their own hands. Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects who formed part of the mob justice is requested to contact Captain Khazamula Mchabi on 082 729 0343 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
