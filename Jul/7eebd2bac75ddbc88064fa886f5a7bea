THEY were on their way to deliver booze to their customers. And to hide the booze, they put it in bags of potatoes in the boot of the car. But just as they were approaching their destination, they found Kagiso cops waiting for them. So the driver tried to make a U-turn, but cops had already seen them. They stopped the car and found bottles of alcohol stuffed into bags of potatoes when they searched the vehicles. The driver and his two friends were bust on the spot on Sunday, 18 July. Captain Solomon Sibiya of Kagiso cop shop in Mogale City, said the three will appear in court this week. He said the suspects, aged 26, 27 and 36, were stopped and searched in Tshepisong during a special operation conducted in the Kagiso policing area. “The police noticed the suspects’ car driving between Tshepisong and Extension 13. “As cops approached from the opposite direction, the driver attempted to reverse. “The police stopped him and started to conduct body and vehicle searches,” he said. Sibiya said during the search, two paper bags meant for potatoes were found with bottles of beers. They also discovered a school bag which contained two bottles of unknown brands of alcohol. “All three suspects were placed under arrest and later detained at Kagiso cop shop. “A case docket of transporting liquor during lockdown was opened. “They will appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court soon,” he said.
