As they prepare for their second stint in the DStv Premiership, Marumo Gallants, previously known as TTM, have concluded deals with Sibusiso Khumalo and Matome Kgoetyane, SunSport has learnt reliably. The 31-year-old Khumalo has been lost in the game after joining Black Leopards last year while Kgoetyane, 29, moves to Gallants from Baroka FC. It is unclear whether Gallants will hold on to the services of coach Dylan Kerr, but it is understood that negotiations may have collapsed between the two parties. "The club will announce their new plans this week. There has been a number of quality players that were signed by the club. And Dylan Kerr seems to be reluctant on agreeing to what has been offered to him by the club. It's actually still open in their coaching post. But indications are that it's up to the club to decide," said our source. In the meantime, Kerr's assistant duo - Mpho Maleka and David Mathebula - are keeping players busy during this off season.
