KAIZER Chiefs defender, Ramahlwe “Rama” Mphahlele, said they are aware of what Al Ahly have achieved over the years, but they remain unshaken. He emphasised fact that football matches are decided in 90 minutes, not based on what happened in the past. He said this ahead of their Caf Champions League final against the Red Devils at the Mohammed V Stadium in Morocco on Saturday (9pm). “Al Ahly are the biggest team in Africa, and they have won this trophy (Champions League) more than any other team,” Mphahlele said in a circulated media audio. “But football is not about what you have done in the past. It’s about the 90 minutes, about how prepared you are for the 90 minutes and we are well prepared. We are ready for them.” Mphahlele believes Amakhosi will not be doing this job only for themselves but also for the country, as teams from the other countries will also know that in Mzansi, it is not only Mamelodi Sundowns. Sundowns have become the regular feature in the continental competition, and they stamped their authority in 2016 when they won the title under coach Pitso Mosimane, who is now coaching the Egyptian giants’ Al Ahly. Said Mphahlele: “If Chiefs win this, then the entire South Africa will benefit because the teams from north Africa – Morocco, Egypt and Algeria – will begin to know that South African teams can play good football. A few years ago, Sundowns won it. It is very important that all South African teams must play in this competition annually.” The final in Casablanca will be an opportunity for Mphahlele to finally lay his hands on the Champions League trophy after missing out in 2016 when he joined Amakhosi, just before Sundowns won the trophy. Amakhosi are eyeing their first Caf title, while the Egyptian giants will be chasing their 10th.
