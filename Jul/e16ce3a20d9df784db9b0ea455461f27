PROPHET Collen Mgodeli says he will not stop praying at the Union Buildings until all is well in Mzansi. According to Collen, the country’s foundation is shaking and needs spiritual intervention. The Rastafarian prophet told Daily Sun in 2018, he wrote President Cyril Ramaphosa a letter outlining the importance of praying for the SANDF, police stations, schools, mines and parliament. Collen said he had been praying at the Union Buildings for over 20 years and only death would put an end to it. “I received a message from God before 1994. God instructed me to tell South African leaders to go to the mountains to pray.” Collen said God didn’t reveal many things but told him there would be peace and people should keep praying. “I pray at the Union Buildings every two weeks. I will be praying for the rest of my life and not for a better life for myself, as it’s an insult to God to demand little things,” he said. Collen said he handed letters to the police at the entrance of the buildings, hoping they would make their way to the president. “As long as there is no response from our number one citizen, I will continue praying because I love our leaders, our people and the country.” Collen said he also prayed for an end to diseases and misunderstandings between people. “In one of my visions, I saw Ramaphosa building South Africa to become a prosperous country,” he said. His message to protesters was to stop burning tyres, as it was like killing people. Kenneth “Angel” Hlatwayo, also a Rastafarian, said he had known Collen for more than 30 years. “He is praying for peace, love, unity and freedom for those who were arrested for things they didn’t do,” he said.
