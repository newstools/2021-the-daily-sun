CAPE Town City have signed Richards Bay striker Khanyisa Mayo. The club confirmed the signing of Mayo this morning, continuing their trend of announcing new players early in the morning. “Cape Town City are delighted to announce the signing of South African forward Khanyisa Mayo. Let's welcome our new Citizen,” said the club. Mayo, the son of Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana striker, Patrick, becomes the sixth signing of the 2021-22 season for City after the acquisition of the Democratic Republic of the Congo defender Nathan Idumba Fasika, young defender Patrick Fisher, midfielder Katlego Mokhuoane, as well as goalkeepers Darren Keet and Bongani Mpandle to the team. Mayo had an outstanding season last term with the Natal Rich Boyz last season, scoring nine goals in 24 matches in all competitions to help the club reach the promotion and relegation playoffs. The 22-year-old also helped the KwaZulu-Natal club to the quarter-finals of Nedbank Cup where they lost to losing finalists Chippa United. He scored two goals in the competition, both of them against TS Sporting in the round of 16. In the first round when the club stunned Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 at FNB Stadium, Mayo’s corner was guided in by Austin Dube, who is on his way to join Amakhosi. Mayo was named the Nedbank Cup Most Promising Player. Meanwhile, Richards Bay is also set to lose defender Veluyeke Zulu, who is training with Chippa United. However, the club has signed former Polokwane City winger Sipho Mngomezulu. ?? | Cape Town City are delighted to announce the signing of South African forward Khanyisa Mayo.Let’s welcome our new Citizen! ??#iamCityFC pic.twitter.com/sS94JebXSh
