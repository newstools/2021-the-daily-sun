FORMER ANC Nelson Mandela Bay Region chairman Andile Lungisa has been suspended from the ANC for 18 months. The provincial disciplinary committee in the Eastern Cape found the controversial former Nelson Mandela Bay councillor guilty of violating Rule 25.17.2. of the ANC constitution. On Wednesday, 14 July, provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukaitobi wrote a letter to Nelson Mandela Bay Regional task team coordinator Luyolo Nqakula, informing him about the committee’s decision to suspend Lungisa. Both Nqakula and spokesman Loyiso Magqashela could not be reached as they were in a meeting. Lungisa could also not be reached for comment. “This serves to inform you that Lungisa has been suspended for 18 months by the provincial disciplinary committee, following being charged for violating Rule 25.17.2. of the ANC constitution,” he wrote. “This suspension follows him being charged by the ANC, after he was found guilty by a court of law on charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on councillor Raino Kaiser, and the subsequent custodial sentence of two years without an option of a fine.” In the letter, Ngcukaitobi said: “The committee has also directed Lungisa to attend anger management classes for 12 months as part of his rehabilitation process.” He also said his office had been alerted that Lungisa filed an appeal with the ANC’s national disciplinary committee regarding the finding. Lungisa was released on parole in December after serving three months of his two-year sentence for assault. He had handed himself to the North End prison in Gqeberha after his appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Appeal last September.
