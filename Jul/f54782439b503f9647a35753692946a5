CHIPPA United midfielder, Maloisane Mokhele, is confident that their new coach Gavin Hunt will help the team avoid being involved in relegation battles again. In fact, Mokhele believes the former Kaizer Chiefs mentor’s wealth of experience will see the Chilli Boys finish the upcoming season within the top six. The Gqeberha-based side avoided relegation by the skin of their teeth via play-offs after finishing second bottom on the DStv Premiership table on 27 points from 30 matches. They were four points ahead of relegated Black Leopards, who ended the season at the basement. Said Mokhele: “I have never worked with coach Hunt before, but what he has done in the past with other clubs speaks volumes. He helped Chiefs to reach the Caf Champions League final. He has done a great job to uplift the standard of football in the country and he is well respected in the PSL. I have no doubt that he will help the club finish the season within the top six or eighth position.” The 24-year-old player said accumulating points early is vital to avoid slipping up again. “We need to work together as a team and avoid putting ourselves under pressure by winning the majority of our games, especially in the first round. We should avoid dropping points unnecessarily and work hard to avoid being in the relegation zone,” he said. Mokhele reckons the arrival of Hunt will help enhance his chances of getting his first Bafana Bafana call-up. “Our new coach believes in youngsters, having given players like Happy Mashiane and Nkosingiphile Ngcobo a chance to play regularly at Chiefs. Last season was my first in the PSL and I helped the team reach the Nedbank Cup final (lost 1-0 to Marumo Gallants) and win other matches in the league. I also wish to see myself playing for Bafana Bafana and winning the league one day. But my immediate target is to score more goals to help my club win games,” added Mokhele.
