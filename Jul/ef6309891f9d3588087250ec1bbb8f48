CONVICTED former president Jacob Zuma has won his court bid in his application to have a leading prosecutor in his corruption trial to recuse himself. Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Piet Koen ruled that the proceedings would be postponed to 10-13 August, but would still be heard virtually, unless that platform was revised or revoked. Koen invited both parties, including Correctional Services, to provide a list in point form of any considerations or prejudice that may arise in the hearing continuing virtually. He was specific that the presentation should not be more than two pages, but be more direct to help him reach a conclusion on whether the hearing should continue virtually or not. “The list of considerations and prejudices referred to in paragraph 4 above must be compiled with reference to the circumstances that might prevail or anticipated to prevail as from 9 August,” Koen ruled. He said the presentations should be submitted to the court registrar in accordance with an earlier email this month that invited parties to make representations on the postponement of the matter. He also ordered that the prison where Zuma was serving time be copied. Koen’s call for the parties to factor in the circumstances anticipated to prevail was in line with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call for courts to close shop due to unrest in the province. Zuma’s legal team is likely to further push for him to be allowed physically in court when the hearing for the recusal of Advocate Billy Downer is heard. Both Advocate Dali Mpofu and Advocate Thabani Masuku argued that conducting the hearing virtually would deny Zuma a fair trial, and be a violation of his rights. They also submitted that they had not consulted enough with Zuma to proceed with the hearing, as suggested by the state.
