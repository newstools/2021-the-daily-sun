SWALLOWS FC have made sure that one of their top players last season, Tlakusani Mthethwa, will remain with the Dube Birds this season. Many of the players who helped Swallows win promotion in the 2019-20 campaign to the DStv Premiership were handed short-term contracts this past season. Mthethwa, who was hampered by a long term injury last season, was one of those players who have been rewarded with a new and improved contract. The 28-year-old midfielder played in 21 matches in all competitions last season, but picked up a bad knee injury against Chippa United on 20 March at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. The injury ruled him out for the remainder of the season. Birds chairman, David Mogashoa, said then the player, who took the season by storm by claiming four Man of the Match awards, might miss the first half of next season. However, that hasn’t stopped Mogashoa from rewarding him with the long-term deal. “We renewed his contract and it is a long term one we gave him,” Mogashoa said. Swallows are in a rebuilding phase. They recently signed former Stellenbosch FC winger Dillon Solomons, on top of free agents Thandani Ntshumayelo and Khethukuthula Zwane from Uthongathi FC. At the same time, the Dube Birds lost Sifiso Hlanti, Njabulo Ngcobo, Kgaogelo Sekgota to Kaizer Chiefs. Given Thibedi and Sizwe Twala, who were on loan from Chiefs, have also gone back to Amakhosi. Bantu Mzwakali was let go alongside Sammy Seabi, who was on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns. Meanwhile, it has been learnt that Ruzaigh Gamildien will no longer be joining Chiefs, but will remain at Swallows.
