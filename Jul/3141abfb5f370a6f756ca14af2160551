ERNST Middendorp, has expressed disappointment that no one is giving him the credit he deserves after Kaizer Chiefs reached the Caf Champions League final. “A team of AmaZulu’s calibre to qualify for the Champions League it’s a huge achievement,” said Middendorp. “I know what it means. I did it myself and nobody really, on the other side, was proud of it. But it is a huge, huge achievement for AmaZulu.” Middendorp quickly stopped speaking about the issue, which was a dig at Chiefs, who will face Al Ahly in Morocco on Saturday night (9 pm) He then praised AmaZulu, who finished second last season and will play in the Champions League if Chiefs fail to defeat Ahly tomorrow. Middendorp was fired by Chiefs management after the club lost the league title to Mamelodi Sundowns at the end of the 2019-20 season, having been at te top the whole season only to lose it in last 20 minutes. Chiefs are heading to this encounter carrying the underdog tag as Pitso Mosimane’s Ahly are heavy favourites. Ahly have won this competition nine times, while Chiefs are in the final of this cup for the first time in their history. Chiefs will want to complete a memorable feat to win it, as they are first team to reach a final without conceding a goal at home in the Champions League in over two decades. The triumph will also be a welcome as Chiefs had last season to forget, battling through to finish in the top eight. The top eight finish was even in doubt, but Chiefs management had to make a tough decision to let go of coach Gavin Hunt in May, who came under enormous pressure.
