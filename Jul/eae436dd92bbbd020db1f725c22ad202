MARUMO Gallants expected to announce their new coach to replace Dylan Kerr on Wednesday afternoon. A source close to Gallants told SunSport that former AmaZulu and Thanda Royal Zulu coach Roger Palmgren will be the man to take charge of the Limpopo based-side next season. The last time the Swedish-born mentor coached in South Africa was in 2012 in charge of AmaZulu. The 58-year-old spent three years at AmaZulu and two at Royal Zulu where he worked with Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana striker Bernard Parker. Palgrem is a well experienced coached who has worked in nine countries like China, Mazanzi, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Italy, Sierra Leone and at his home country. Palgrem has been coaching Swedish side FC Nacka IIiria of Stockholm. "I cannot reveal the name of the coach and please wait until we announce him today," saidÂ  Bahlabane ba Ntwa Liason Manager, Rufus Matsena. SunSport has also learnt that Mamelodi Sundowns legend Harris Choue is also expected to be unveiled as their new club Technical Director. Choue has worked at Downs as their development scout. Kerr's contract expired at the end of last month and the club chairman Abraham Sello decided to part ways with the Englishman despite helping them avoid relegation and winning the Nedbank Cup.
