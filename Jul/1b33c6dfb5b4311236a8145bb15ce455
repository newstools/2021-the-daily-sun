SUPERSPORT United’s young defender Keenan Phillips will look back on the 2020-21 season with fondness. The 21-year-old made his mark in the DStv Premiership, forcing his way into coach Kaitano Tembo’s plans. Phillips, who joined the Tshwane giants from now-defunct Bidvest Wits, is currently an important player for Matsatsantsa a Pitori. In his first season at the club, Phillips saw off competition from the more experienced duo of Grant Kekana and Siyabonga Nhlapho for the right-back position. He made a total of 23 appearances in all competitions last season, playing a whopping 1 618 minutes. This was a huge jump from the four matches he played at Wits the season before. “Being one of the youngest players in the team is always challenging as you constantly want to prove your worth,” Phillips said. “I feel I had done so and due to that I was seen by the right eyes and achieved Man of the Match awards. There is always more than one choice for a position in a club of this size and I had to remain consistent. “And having a healthy competition with Siyabonga Nhlapo and Grant Kekana allowed me to work harder, and they were a great support system to help me grow.” Phillips’ impressive campaign has not gone unnoticed with Bafana Bafana assistant coach Helman Mkhalele, handing him a national team call up for the underway Cosafa Cup. “My two main goals are to play in Europe and experience the type of soccer they play there and win young player of the season. But at the moment I will focus on doing my job at SuperSport United Football Club,” he added.
