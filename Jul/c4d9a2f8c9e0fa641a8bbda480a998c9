FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s supporters, amabutho and priests broke Covid-19 regulations and marched in Nkandla, KZN, on Thursday, 1 July, to show their support. They said they would defend Zuma and make sure no one had access to him. During their march, they fired shots in the air. They also prevented the media from taking photos of them as the majority had no masks on and there was no social distancing. Some of them held placards reading: “Ramaphosa must fall” and “Judge Khampepe is captured”.

No one will touch him in front of us. Touching Zuma is touching us. The arrest they are talking about will not happen. If it happens, they will have to kill us first,” he said. On Tuesday, 29 June, the Constitutional Court sentenced Zuma to 15 months direct imprisonment. He was ordered to hand himself over to Nkandla or Joburg central police within five days. And if he fails to do so, police will have to arrest him within three days. Amabutho leader (induna) Dumisani Zuma said they were ready to defend Zuma, and anyone who wanted to arrest him must arrest all amabutho in KZN and Gauteng.  “We have many amabutho members who are ready to defend Zuma. We know that his sentence was planned a long time ago because people who hate him are using biased courts to fight against him.” Bishop Sandile Ndlela, who had gone to Nkandla to pray for him, said he was aware that the cops and the premier wanted to arrest them for supporting Zuma. “We’re at Zuma’s gate to pray. If they want to arrest us, they are free to come. But we will never stop supporting and defending Zuma,” he said.
