 THEIR job is to entertain women with their sexy dance moves. And although ijob ijob, the male strippers are tired of one thing. WOMEN RIPPING OFF THEIR OUTFITS AND GRABBING THEIR 4-5s! This could be seen in a video that did the rounds on social media recently. In the video, a woman pulls out a male stripper’s 4-5 while he performs, but the stripper doesn’t take too kindly to this and kicks the woman in the face. Social media said the stripper got angry because his 4-5 is small. Daily Sun spoke to strippers who shared the challenges they face while performing. Mr Jones (28) said he’s been a stripper for four years.  He said he had to deal with women who couldn’t handle themselves during his performances. He said as some women just wanted to poke, they grabbed his 4-5, which crossed boundaries. “I saw that video and I’ve experienced it. That person didn’t do it out of spite. I’m sure she just wanted to see what was underneath,” said Jones. “We appreciate the attention, but this is really disturbing and needs to stop.”  Another stripper, known as Flax, said a man once ripped off his outfit while he was performing. “It’s sometimes really hard, especially when you’re dealing with a crowd that’s not used to such. Men throw tins at us while we perform,” said Flax. He said even though they faced challenges, they continue to perform because they love what they do. “The only time we don’t experience problems is at bridal showers or small events. Otherwise, we take it and soldier on.” Another stripper who calls himself Hardware said his underwear was ripped off twice. He said it’s always by people who are not used to strippers and go to such events with their boyfriends. “Men obviously don’t like what we do, but their girlfriends like us,” he said
