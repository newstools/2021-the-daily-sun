CAPE Towns Spurs are hard at work bolstering their squad ahead of the upcoming GladAfrica Championship season. The Urban Warriors have secured the services of defensive midfielder Jarrod Moroole. The former Stellenbosch FC skipper is Spurs’ first signing this season as they look to beef up their squad. They will be looking to strengthen their team as they look to bounce back from the last campaign which saw them escape relegation by the skin of their teeth. Moroole is no stranger to Ikamva having featured for the club’s youth teams before going on to play for Old Mutual, FC Cape Town, Vasco, Stellenbosch FC and most recently Cape Town All Stars. “It has been a good journey,” said Moroole. “I’ve been to many clubs over the years but this is where it all started. It’s good to be back. “I was here in 1999 when Cape Town Spurs and Seven Stars merged to form Ajax Cape Town. I was here for seven years. My foundation phase was really good, I was able to build good technical attributes which are very important. In life, it is important to have a good foundation. “It is very good to be back at Ikamva. I would like to help Spurs back into the Premiership. Spurs have to be back playing in the top-flight. We need to get the team promoted; back to where the club belongs.”
