Former top spy, Thulani Dlomo, who is believed to be a key supporter of former President Jacob Zuma, has handed himself over at the Durban Central Police Station this afternoon. According to the SABC Dlomo's decision comes after allegations that he is among those responsible for fuelling the looting and unrest that started in KwaZulu-Natal and spread to Gauteng.The SABC said he was accompanied by his lawyer Phumlani Shangase, who is yet to confirm. The public broadcaster further said it is believed that he is also concerned for his and his family's safety. In a statement seen byÂ IOL, Dlomo denied the allegations. He was quoted saying: "I reject with the contempt that it deserves, any attempt to link me to the unrest happening in the country. This is but a smokescreen to deflect from legitimate concerns about the arrest of President Jacob Zuma and the frustration due to poverty of the communities and people."
