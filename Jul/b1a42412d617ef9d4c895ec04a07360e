GOSPEL singer Katlego Modiba is making a strong comeback after a five-year break from the industry. The 31-year-old from Ga-Mphahlele in Limpopo stopped releasing music in 2016 to perfect his craft. He came back to release an album titled Mphagamishe Morena in April, scoring himself an Independent National Gospel Music Awards (Ingoma) nomination for best newcomer. Katlego told SunBuzz he had worked hard to be where he was. “In 2016, I took a break because my journey wasn’t easy. I tried for years to look for recording companies that would sign me, but I didn’t succeed. So, I decided to stop,” he said. “However, during that break, I worked very hard because I knew that when I come back, my music should be great. The quality was supposed to be perfect. “So, I went to different studios, recording the same songs to find great quality. “I worked so hard for my music to reach this level and I’m glad to be finally here,” he said.

He will do the same for other people.” Katlego said that even though he had taken a break, he still had goals and continued to work towards them. “I never gave up on music because I had goals that I wanted to achieve, and one of them was to be nominated for an award. “I am happy I reached that goal, and I’m still working on others. “In the past years, I would write songs and just save them because I knew the right time for releasing my album would come,” said Katlego. “Mphagamishe Morena has been doing great since being released. People can find it on digital music platforms.” The Ingoma Awards will be held on 28 August.
