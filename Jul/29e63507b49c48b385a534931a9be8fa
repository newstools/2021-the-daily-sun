Finally, the law has prevailed against former president Jacob Zuma. Msholozi being found guilty of contempt of court after refusing to appear at the Zondo Commission is a sign that our justice system is not afraid of anyone. This judgment is a historical milestone and a victory for the rule of law in South Africa. It’s clear for all to see that Zuma’s attempts to ignore, undermine and destroy the rule of law will not be tolerated in our democratic society. The law has taken its course. Our law and Constitution must be respected by all of us. Our court was forced to act and it had no choice. Those who continue to underestimate it will suffer the consequences. Zuma’s been defiant throughout and showed he doesn’t respect our justice system. He’s been given an opportunity on numerous occasions to present himself, but chose to undermine our Constitution. He’s been in prison before and this time he just undermined and took things lightly. Nobody is above the law and I hope others have learnt from this.
