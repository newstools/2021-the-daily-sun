MZANSI Magic’s controversial reality TV show Mnakwethu is coming back to the small screens on Tuesday, 6 July. Host Musa Mseleku said the standard was high this season. “Like the previous season, this one will be telling a difficult story of men who aspire to take second wives, but find it difficult to ask their first wives. And as usual, Mnakwethu is never without drama due to the fact that this happens without the first wife being aware,” said the polygamist and reality TV star on his show, Uthando Nesthembu. “There’s also always a twist. Even as a presenter, I never know what to expect. But this season, the standard is too high. I’m happy that the women involved are vocal and know exactly what they stand for.” Mseleku still thinks people will have negative reviews about this season, too. “I don’t even forsee a stage in the near future where South Africans will be happy about Mnakwethu. That’s the reality of polygamy. There’s never the right time to introduce a second wife. So coming from that understanding, I don’t think we could expect others to love and understand it. But it’s a good story to tell. And up until the mindset of society changes, then they will learn to appreciate what we’re doing. It’s more education,” he said.

And two or three years from now, people will accept the reality of isithembu. I think with Uthando Nesthembu and Mnakwethu, we have achieved in changing some mindsets so far. “But I guarantee that people will accept this reality. When we continue with Mnakwethu, even wives will be approaching us, saying they’re aware their husbands have partners, asking Mnakwethu for help,” he said.
