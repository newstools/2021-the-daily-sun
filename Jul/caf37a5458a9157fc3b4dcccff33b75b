GRACIOUS Mokgatsane (38) has lost her 19-year-old son when her house caught fire in the early hours of Friday morning, 2 July. She also lost everything including her furniture and clothes in the flames. She managed to escape the raging flames with her other five children. Gracious is fighting for her life in hospital while her five children were treated and discharged. It still remains a mystery how the fire started.  Her neighbour Salome Letsatsi told Daily Sun that she was woken up by a screaming voice outside and when she went to check what was happening, she realised that her neighbour’s house was engulfed by a thick smoke. This happened in Nkangala section H near Bronkhorspruit, Mpumalanga. “I woke up other neighbours and we rushed to save them. We used a spade shovel to force open the burglar door. We managed to save our neighbour and her kids. Later, she told us that her older child was still trapped in the house. We couldn’t enter because the flames and smoke were too strong. We tried to extinguish the fire using sand and water but it was too much. We then called the paramedics and cops. Gracious was taken by a chopper to hospital because she suffered severe burn wounds on her body,” she said.  Another neighbour Welheminah Mahlangu (42) said when she heard the voices outside, she thought people were fighting on the street. “I peeped through the window and I got the shock of my lif when I saw thick smoke going up. I immediately woke up and rushed to help. We only managed to save six lives. Unfortunately the other kid was still trapped inside the burning house. The mother told us very late so we couldn’t save him,” she said. Salome said they are asking for help from Good Samaritans to help the family start over. Gauteng police spokesman Kay Makhubele said an inquest was opened over the death of a child. “The child was burnt beyond recognition and the cause of fire is unknown,” he said.
