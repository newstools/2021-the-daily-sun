Lehlogonolo “Nolo” Machaba will continue to inspire many people in the country, especially the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) community. By participating in the Miss South Africa pageant, she has basically showed that transgender people are as normal, and just like any other person. Transgender people are denied opportunities and face challenges every day, which is unacceptable. I’m glad that Nolo is breaking the norm and now is close to achieving her life-changing dream. This will make a huge impact in the LGBTI community. Some churches are not helping the situation because they spread hatred against the LGBTI people. They also need to stop preaching hate speech against them. I salute Nolo for having the courage to contest the Miss SA pageant. ) Rachel Molema, Theresa Mews By encouraging and accepting Nolo’s entry, it will go a long way in changing many people’s perceptions. Transgender people have been suffering for a while and we have also reported on numerous occasions on some being killed just for being who they are. This letter wins R200.
