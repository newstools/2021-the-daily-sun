PSL rookies Sekhukhune United continued with their signing spree on Wednesday with the acquisition of midfielder Talent Chiwapiwa from AmaZulu. The Zimbabwean joined an exodus of players who joined Babina Noko in search of glory in the PSL. Said Chiwapiwa: "I am excited to be here and I am looking forward to achieve a lot with the team." Meanwhile, versatile new Sekhukhune defender Ryan de Jongh hopes to help his side lift a trophy in their maiden season in the PSL. The Westbury born player joined the club from Bloemfontein Celtic where he made his professional debut last season. Said De Jongh: “I would like to thank everyone who made it possible for me to be here, enjoy the team and set-up that is at a professional level and that’s how I like it to be. I want us to achieve as a team in terms of regaining our status at the end of the season and get to a point where we win a cup or two. De Jongh insists that Sekhukhune are not in the top flight league just to add the numbers. However, he warned their fans not to expect an easy passage to glory. “We are not just here as newbies in the league, but we want to stay consistent. To our fans, nothing will come easy, every game will be difficult, some games will be a fight and some won’t be as pretty as we would like. But in every game we will work to a point where we want to win everything."
