THE National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NatJoints) has encouraged those who looted goods to return them or face possible arrest. NatJoints, which is co-chaired by the SANDF, SAPS and State Security Agency, has welcomed tip-offs from residents of KZN and Gauteng, which led to a large number of items being recovered. It said that on Sunday, 18 July, 3 407 suspects were arrested on various charges. Only one was granted bail while 1 122 were expected to appear in court. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said: “A warning has been issued to those who were not looting but buying the goods that they would be arrested for possession of stolen property. “In Gauteng, during integrated operations at a number of hostels, mostly in Tembisa, Joburg, Alexandra and Moroka, 14 suspects were arrested for being in possession of suspected looted property.” Peters said among the goods recovered were mattresses, televisions, couches, fridges, sound systems, groceries and clothing. Meanwhile in KZN, 92 suspects were arrested this weekend for possession of stolen property. Peters said NatJoints was once again warning people not to provoke violence or spread messages that seek to increase levels of fear and tension. “These messages instil fear in our communities and undermine the authority of the state. “To this end, police in West Rand District in Gauteng arrested two suspects, both on allegations of creating and circulating inflammatory messages with the potential to incite violence.” She said they were expected to appear in court. “A third suspect, a 21-year-old woman, was arrested in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, on Saturday, 17 July on similar allegations. “She is expected to appear before the Nigel Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 20 July,” she said. Peters said authorities were aware of more messages threatening to attack police stations and disarm officers, attack courts, pipelines and refineries.
