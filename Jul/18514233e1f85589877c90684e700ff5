TB Joshua’s weeklong lavish funeral procession got people
talking on social media, mostly because of the glassy casket, which made all
his mourners see him clearly. The body of the founder of Synagogue Church of all Nations
(SCOAN) in Lagos Nigeria was dressed in a white suit and white shoes. His body was placed at the centre of the church’s auditorium
for all to view. His casket arrived at the church in the afternoon on
Thursday after a service at the Prayer Mountain in Agodo-Egbe in Nigeria. The funeral motorcade arrived at the Scoan headquarters in
Ikotun-Egbe, Lagos, where his body will lie in state before burial on Friday. Hundreds of mourners filled the SCOAN on Thursday after a
week-long funeral service that began on Sunday. Mourners came to pay their final respect to their beloved
Prophet.  People on Twitter shared their thought on his casket. @INVADERWAYNE said: "TB Joshua likes attention, noma
efile uhamba nge see-through coffin." @smelling_boxer said: "Vanity!!! The money used for all
this can change the life of many… nonsense!!!"  @RealAsivesaid said: "Transparent coffin though." TB Joshua died on 5 June just days before his 58 birthday.
His death came as a shock to many as he had a live broadcast a day before.
