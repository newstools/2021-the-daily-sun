THE families of people killed during the riots in Durban have been left traumatised. A total of 22 people from Amaoti north of Durban lost their lives. And most deaths happened in Phoenix, where residents put up road blocks and allegedly shot at people. On Tuesday, 20 July, KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala paid a visit to the families of the victims, accompanied by members of the provincial executive council and eThekwini Municipality. Sipholazi Chiliza (45) said her brother, Saziso Mnukwa (38), was heading to Cornubia Mall with friends when they were shot at. He died on the scene. “On Monday morning, 19 July, he went to loot Cornubia with his friends, but they never arrived as they were shot in Phoenix. “His friends ran back home to tell us. “When we got there, he was already dead. “I know what they were going to do was wrong, but they were on their way. They didn’t steal anything in Phoenix,” she said. Sebenzile Nzimande (29) said her brother Thulasizwe Nzimande (15) was returning from the shop on Tuesday when he was shot in the head.  “We are not sure where the bullet came from but after getting shot, he came into the house. We rushed him to the clinic but it was closed, so we returned home. He died the following day.” Zikalala promised to follow up on the killings. “Seeing so many people killed in one place shows hatred,” he claimed. Zikalala claimed a lot of people were unhappy about the jailing of former president Jacob Zuma. “Following those complaints, a lot of bad things happened such as looting and even death. “Even the former president won’t be happy about these things,” he claimed. Zikalala assured the families that the government was with them.
