Up-and-coming artist Linric Toto (43) has penned a song, titled Ithongo Lam, in honour of her late mother. It comes after her debut single Ithemba Lam, which she released three years ago. “Ithemba Lam was my letter to God about my hopes and dreams. I poured myself out to my creator,” she said. Speaking about her new song, she said: “This is a song of gratitude and appreciation to my mother. I’m what I am because of her. She guided and taught me everything about life and music. “I believe that she continues to be a good ancestor to me. “On this song, I’m also showing gratitude to my guides for leading my way and praying before God.” “I sing tribal music known as ukombela – a deep Xhosa genre. The song was released on 13 May, and is available on all digital platforms.” Originally from the Eastern Cape, Linric Toto started singing in church. “I’ve been singing throughout my life, but it wasn’t professional.

I was also happy to share my Xhosa background,” she said. While there, she joined a gospel group called The Anointed UK, which later won Best Gospel Group in the BAFTA awards. From time to time, she would also join South African artists on stage whenever they had shows in the UK. “Three years ago, I decided to go solo and fell in love with ukombela. I guess the sound reminded me of my gogo and women in my village, who would sing whenever they had gatherings or were collecting wood in the veld,” she said. Linric Toto said she wanted to grow the genre. “We don’t have much of this genre. Therefore, my intention is to grow it. This will protect it and ensure that it gets popular.”
