It is another day ekasi. The wings of development have been clipped. What was once shops have now become   slums, ransacked to the core by the same people they served. It’s a sad day to gaze at shopping malls. With their looting, the brainless crowds have pushed back our development. Today, the dwellers of townships and villages will feel the wrath of their own unjustified anger. Criminality won, but prosperity has been chained. Their small fridges can’t house the amount of meat they stole. Soon, everything will go stale and be thrown away. The celebration will last for just a few days. Their family members are now without jobs. Just yesterday they were employed but their jobs were snatched away from them by their own people. It’s a sad day as all we can do is look at what used to be ours. Now we will have to catch two taxis to look for bread. The excitement will soon be over. No thief can steal enough to last a lifetime. Prisons may be just a stone-throw away. We brought this unto ourselves. We made the bed, now it’s time to lie in it. What was built over many years, was brought down in a few hours of madness. Yes, we were happy when doing it. If felt like a bargain, like manna from heaven. But the after effects will be too heavy for us to bear. In a few days, all the sacrifices of many local businessmen and women were wiped out. Many of these small businesses do not have adequate insurance and the businesses destroyed will not be revived. The actions of people who took part in the looting will impact the rest of Mzansi for many years to come. This letter wins R200. Please call Nthabiseng at our office to collect your prize. – Editor
