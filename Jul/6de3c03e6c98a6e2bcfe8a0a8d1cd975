The recent protests about freeing Jacob Zuma are now getting out of hand. These protesters are now robbing people and businesses. This is not a Zuma protest. People are jobless, hungry and are using Zuma to vent their frustrations. People must just stop these acts of vandalism because many people have now lost their jobs in the wake of the looting. Let’s stop stealing because we are destroying our country. - Letter by Moses Mokoena, Ga-Mokwakwaila
