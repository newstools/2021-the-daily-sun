WHEN beer cans fell down during the arrest, one suspect lying on the ground wanted to have a sip. He thought cops were not paying attention to him, and he quickly stretched his arm to reach for the beer. However, the thirsty suspect was instructed to go back by an angry cop. “Throw that away,” the cop shouted. He helplessly looked at the beer foam coming out of the damaged can with sorrow in his eyes. The man was among a group of suspects arrested by cops at Chris Hani Crossing Mall in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, for looting on Tuesday, 13 July. Police had lined suspects on the ground and handcuffed them while waiting for state vehicles to transport them to police cells. This was after they were caught red-handed with stolen goods that including clothes, electronic appliances, sound systems and gadgets. President Cyril Ramaphosa has placed the country under alert level 4 for two more weeks, with the sale of alcohol still prohibited. As the violence spread to other parts of the province, many people were seen looting alcohol. Earlier in the day, Premier David Makhura said over 400 suspects had been arrested in the province in connection with the unrest.
