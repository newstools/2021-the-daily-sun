MARITZBURG United’s versatile Bandile Shandu is set to join Orlando Pirates. United bade Shandu farewell a few days ago and SunSport has learnt that he is heading to the Buccaneers. The 26-year-old, who was promoted by Maritzburg in the 2012-13 season, saw his contract with the Team of Choice end last Wednesday. What is clear is that Shandu wasn’t offered a new deal by management nor was he looking for it to be renewed as his mind was already made up that he will be leaving the club. However, the 26-year-old’s move to Bucs will come as a surprise as Shandu only started 13 of the 22 league matches he played for the Team of Choice last season under coach Ernst Middendorp. “Shandu is going to join Orlando Pirates as a free agent,” said an insider. At Pirates, Shandu will join a growing number of Maritzburg players and coaches such as Fortune Makaringe, Siphesihle Ndlovu, Richard Ofori, coach Fadlu Davids and recently announced coach Mandla Ncikazi. Shandu was at his best under coach Davids, when the club finished in the highest position in the PSL era which was fourth in the 2017-18 season. Maritzburg also reached the final of the Nedbank Cup that season but they lost to Free State Stars, with Shandu starting the match. Shandu also played under Ncikazi, who had a short stint in the 2015-16 season with Davids, who was the assistant coach then, Ncikazi was sacked after he failed win his first five games in charge. Because of his versatility, Shandu can play as a right back, an area where Pirates struggled last season, and as on the right wing. Shandu has featured in 162 matches for Maritzburg, scoring five goals with 12 assists.
