Dear MizzB I’M a 28-year-old guy and my girlfriend is 22. She is not a virgin but refuses to have sex with me because she’s a born-again Christian. I love her but cannot handle this torture anymore. How do I make her realise that sex is an important part of a relationship? Dear Brother Dating someone means understanding and respecting their choices. Sex is part of the package in a relationship, but not the main drive. It’s normal to feel frustrated at times and the best way to approach it is to have an open conversation with your girlfriend. Compromises should be made for the success of the relationship.
