“I’M attracted to Ferraris and Bentleys, but I don’t know if I’ll ever have a chance to own one of those.” This is what American footballer Ndamukong Suh, who expresses his uncertain goal and desire of one day owning one of those beautiful cars, said. While these beautiful cars may be best on the road and very pleasing on the eye, a recent study has shown that men who own and drive such cars are not considered for a long-term relationship. According to the Independent publication, women perceive men who flaunt their wealth as unsuitable partners for a long-term relationship. According to US researchers from the University of Buffalo, ostentatious displays such as driving a flashy car, could be detrimental when it comes to finding a potential partner. The study reveals that people who drive extravagant vehicles are viewed as less reliable and more sexually promiscuous. The study, published in Springer’s journal Evolutionary Psychological Science, asked 375 undergraduate students to complete anonymous online surveys in a bid to investigate how others interpret a man’s display of wealth. The participants first read through the descriptions of two men who were purchasing cars and were asked to rate each character on dating and parenting behaviours, his interest in relationships and his attractiveness to others. Both fictional men spent the same budget but, while one man made a frugal investment, the other opted for a car with new paint, larger wheels and an impressive sound system. The results showed that both male and female participants rated the man with the flashy car as being more interested in brief sexual relationships and did not tick the boxes for a long-term committed partner.
