THE funeral service of City of Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo was filled with memories of a selfless life lived with purpose and passion. His family and friends gathered at the Orlando East Community Hall in Soweto on Wednesday, 14 July, to bid him farewell. Premier David Makhura, Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, Economic Development, Agriculture and Rural Development MEC Parks Tau and Housing MMC Mlungisi Mabaso were in attendance. The mayor’s brother, Tebogo, said: “Two weeks ago, I had a brother and someone who protected me for 47 years. My family and I will never get over his death. “He lived his life looking after me. To his kids, I’m always here. This was the person who shared his clothes with me and everything else he could. I’m shattered and lost for words.” His youngest brother, Padi, said: “I’m broken, and have lost my pillar of strength and cheerleader. What you lived and stood for I will take to new heights. You were a great man and you ran a good race.” Nkosi-Malobane said Makhubo had many friends and she was honoured to speak as one of them.  “Not only was he a friend, but he was a brother, comrade and true servant. He spent his time working for the people using his academic skills to improve the organisation and pioneer the youth,” said Nkosi-Malobane Makhubo’s wife, Dikeledi, also paid tribute. “The day our daughter was born, you were caught in-between coming to see me or going to an ANC conference. But I said go to the conference because I knew how passionate you were about serving. You had big shoes to fill and I’m not sure if I’ll be able to carry on without you. “The best I can do is keep your legacy alive. I was looking forward to the trip you promised to take with me after lockdown. This time, it would just be the two of us without the kids. Thank you for loving me,” said Dikeledi. Tau said Makhubo was like a brother to him. Makhubo was laid to rest at Westpark Cemetery, where his tombstone was also unveiled.
