Khethukuthula Mbatha on Uzalo, whosebetter known as Mr Mbatha, is greedy, jealous and a wannabe popular pastor. But Thabo Mnguni, who portrays the character, insists there are only two things he has in common with Mbatha. “Mbatha wants everything to himself. He doesn’t think of other people. He’s selfish and likes painting people badly. I’m not like that. But we are somehow similar in that I’m vocal and confrontational like him,” he said. He said playing Mbatha reminded him of the days he played Bra Steve in the hilarious SABC1 sitcom, Family Bonds. “Bra Steve was funny and as much as Mbatha is highly manipulative, I like the fact that he’s funny too. TV fans love this character and I enjoy playing it,” said Thabo. ALSO READ | METRO FM NEWSREADER MOURNS HUBBY'S DEATH! He said being confrontational had cost him his best friend, whom he used to act with in Family Bonds. “We used to be best friends but I’m always honest and confrontational. That’s why we ended up not getting along,” said Thabo. He said he also confronted the eThekwini Municipality for sidelining actors and using gqom artists and DJs for tourism purposes. He said his storyline where he recruited people of KwaMashu to join his church, Khethukuthula Family Church (KFC), left people in stitches. “People laughed at me when they saw me. Some even manipulated the KFC logo where they substituted the old man’s photo and put mine. I love that because it shows that I do my job excellently. I love it and I don’t have the feeling that I’m not going to be taken seriously by TV fans. I think they are smart enough to be able to differentiate between a TV character and a real person that portrays a character,” said Thabo.
