THE SA Under-23 coach, David Notoane, has confirmed that Ronwen Williams is the only overaged player going to the Olympic Games. This comes after Abbubaker Mobara (27) was withdrawn due to medical reasons. Mobara was released among essential players such as Lyle Foster, Fagrie Lakay, Sipho Mbule and Keletso Makgalwa. SunSport has reliably learnt that the five players have been replaced by Themba “Mshishi” Zwane, Thendo Mukumela, Kamogelo Mahlangu and Reeve Frosler. All these players were part of the 40 man squad that Notoane selected. On Monday, Notoane told SunSport that they cannot confirm the replacements yet as they are waiting for Covid-19 results. However, he admitted that Mshishi, as Zwane is known, was among his considerations. “Remember Zwane has always been considered among our overaged players, however, we cannot take him due to an injury. Mamelodi Sundowns doctors told us that he has been struggling with hamstring injury since towards the end of last season,” Notoane stated. “So, now we do not want to take an overaged player and when we get to the tournament he breaks down. “We have decided that Ronwen Williams will be the only overaged player that will go with the team. “I must say, the process of replacing a player in the squad is very complicated, but we will see what we can do.” The Under-23’s will leave Mzansi for Japan on Tuesday. Notoane admitted that the late withdrawals affected their plans. He said: “I am satisfied with the camp we had in Mpumalanga but I must say it has been a difficult time, the challenges including the player withdrawals, Covid really affected us.” They were scheduled to play a warm-up match against Australia when they arrive in Japan, but that match has since been cancelled off.
