NEWS anchor Chriselda Lewis is the latest media personality to open up on testing positive for coronavirus. In a brief statement, the seasoned journalist shared that she tested positive last month, and had since been nursing her health. “Late last month, I had tested positive for Covid-19. It has been a painful and scary journey towards recovery. I thank the Almighty for giving me more life. The doctors, my family, friends and colleagues who showed so much love and care,” she said. Chriselda said although her isolation period had lapsed, she would still be taking some time off. “While my isolation period has lapsed, I will be away for a few more days to regain strength and provide emotional and logistical support to others who are nearing the end of their isolation period,” she added. The TV journalist, who has been away on social media since testing positive, urged everyone to be safe and take care of themselves. “I have been away from social media for a while as the grief of families losing their loved ones has been too much to bare. May God grant them comfort. Please be safe. God bless you. See you soon,” she said. ALSO READ | TOP SOCCER PLAYER GETS HITCHED!
