AMAZULU goalkeeper Veli Mothwa is honoured to lead the SA national team Bafana Bafana on his debut. Mothwa will captain Bafana during the Cosafa tournament as they will be hoping to improve on their showing at the 2019 edition, where they lost to Botswana at the quarter-final stage on penalties. Bafana will kick off the tournament's group stages on Tuesday with a clash against Botswana in Gqeberha. Helman Mkhalele's charges will then play against Eswatini before ending the group stage phase against Lesotho on 14 July. Talking after being appointed as the captain for the tournament, Mothwa said: "I was not expecting to be named the team captain. "However, I am honoured and excited to be the captain of the senior national team. "It is a huge responsibility. When you are the captain, you have to step up and motivate the players around you. It means a lot to be a captain for me, and I will do everything to lead by example." Mamelodi Sundowns defender Rushine de Reuck and Usuthu midfielder Siyethemba Sithebe will deputise if Mothwa is not available. Mothwa will be donning the national team colours for the first time when he leads Bafana on Tuesday against Botswana. "I do not have international experience and playing on Tuesday in a national team jersey would be my first time," he stated. Coach @Helman_Mkhaleke has announced that Veli Mothwa from @amazulu will wear the Captains armband while Rushine De Reuk @sundowns and Siyathemba Sithebe @amazulu will deputise. @Cosafamedia @SAFA_Net pic.twitter.com/1FDkO3P0h5
