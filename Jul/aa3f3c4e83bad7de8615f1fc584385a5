The executive mayor of Johannesburg, Geoff Makhubo, has been hospitalised for Covid-19 complications following a positive test result late last month. The City's spokesperson Mlimandlela Ndamase said in statement on Saturday that Makhubo would remain in hospital "until his medical team is satisfied [with] his recovery". Makhubo tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 June and went into self-quarantine. The mayor committed to continue monitoring and providing guidance on work being carried out to contain and manage the spread of Covid-19 in Johannesburg. The City urged residents to continue adhering to Level 4 lockdown regulations and following non-pharmaceutical preventative measures such as wearing a mask. "Joburg residents are urged once more to take all necessary precautions to remain safe and to avoid infection. This includes strict adherence to non-medical practices of wearing masks, sanitising regularly and minimising movement in line with the Level 4 restrictions announced by the president," Ndamase said.
