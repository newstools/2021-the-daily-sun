A MUM was shot and killed in the early hours of Saturday morning 3 July after transferring her last R100 into an armed robber’s account. At about 1am, unknown men broke into the 36-year-old’s home in Kanana Village, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo. Her 13-year-old son was still up as he was preparing for exams. The boy said: “I was packing up my books to go to sleep when the door suddenly opened.” A man ordered the boy to call his parents, who were already asleep. The boy ran to his parents’ room and told them there was a snake in the house. As they came into his room, the man pointed a gun at them, tied up the son and locked him in his room. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the parents were then tied up and ordered to transfer money using a cellphone app. They transferred all the money they had, which was only R100. The suspect shot the mum five times but left the husband unharmed before fleeing the scene. She was rushed to Sekororo Clinic in Moshate Village, Tzaneen, and certified dead on arrival. Mojapelo said it was a random home invasion but the police had not heard reports of similar incidents in the area. “No arrests have been made yet. We’re appealing to anyone who can assist us with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspect to call their nearest police station, 08600 10111 or make a tip-off on the My SAPS app,” he said.
