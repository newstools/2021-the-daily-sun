NEXT UP, it’s the Castle Lager Lions Series opening Test between the Springboks and The British & Irish Lions at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. It has been a roller-coaster ride for the Lions since they have been in the country with Covid-19 infections affecting preparations for them, and those of the Boks. As they charge up for the big Test, five players scored their first tries for Lions as the tourists entered the first Test week with a 49-3 victory over the Stormers. In the opening half, the Lions came up against consistent pressure and power before three tries from the pack gave them the upper hand at the break. An uneven second half saw the return from injury of Tour skipper Alun Wyn Jones as the forwards dominated the try scoring for the Lions. Questions answered for Nienaber in South Africa “A” defeat Marcus Smith got his Lions debut off to a dream start with a measured kick into Stormers territory – after receiving the ball from kick off – before blocking a kick from Sergeal Petersen. The Lions crossed the whitewash first through Luke Cowan-Dickie but the England hooker was judged to have made a double movement as he attempted to dot the ball down. Stormers responded with their own period of attack and after several phases they were rewarded with a penalty against Hamish Watson, with Tim Swiel kicking the first points of the game. But following a sweeping attack from a turnover ball, Lions lock Adam Beard picked a gap in the defence and dotted down to get his maiden Lions try as Smith converted to get his first points of the Tour. After the Stormers were penalised at the scrum, the maul from the resulting line-out allowed Cowan-Dicke to cross for his first Lions try, reaching over last-ditch tacklers to crash the ball down. And in the closing seconds of the first half, Cowan-Dickie’s clubmate Jonny Hill got in on the try-scoring act after good work from Ali Price and Stuart Hogg as the Lions went into half-time leading 21-3.
