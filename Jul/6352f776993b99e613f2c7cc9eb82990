WHILE President Cyril Ramaphosa was addressing the nation last night (Monday, 12 July), violence and looting got worse in Gauteng. Thugs took over most malls and shopping centres in different kasis throughout the night, right until the morning. Today, (Tuesday, 13 July), people were seen further looting. In Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, Chris Hani Mall was looted and shops were set alight. Police used rubber bullets to disperse the crowd trying to loot even more. Other malls and centres affected in Ekurhuleni were Gold Spot Centre, Naledi Mall, Letsoho shopping centre, Sam Ntuli Mall, Spruitview Complex and Busy Corner Mall. In Soweto, Jabulani Mall, Diepkloof Square, Protea Glen Mall and Bambanani Mall were among the centres that were ransacked. However, Eldorado Park residents distanced themselves from the mayhem. A group of community leaders have been monitoring busy roads coming into their kasi for any disruptions. ALSO READ:Â LOOTERS BATHATHE KONKE!

The violence that has engulfed in two provinces started as an alleged pro-Zuma protest following the jailing of former president Jacob Zuma. Since the beginning of the unrest, six people have died in Gauteng and four in KwaZulu-Natal. Over 160 suspects have been arrested in KZN and 323 in Gauteng.
