Idols SA's second week came with more success and talent. While 20 golden tickets were given out last week, 31 were given out this week on the Mzansi Magic singing competition. Although it got off on a rocky start, the show picked up. The first contestant, Wandile Jacobs did not impress the judges. The bubbly and confident contestant was disappointed by the nos he got from the judges. He got a wooo sham from Somizi for his personality. The first golden ticket went to 16-year-old Zukisa who sang Ami Faku's Ubuhle Bakho. A first for Idols was Chosi, who played uhadi, a Xhosa traditional instrument. The singer said she wants to preserve her culture as Xhosa people. She walked away with a golden ticket. Milani, a 21-year-old from East London disappointed the judges when she said she was confident in herself because it was her birthday. Somizi told her they have balloons for contestants who are celebrating their birthdays and get golden tickets. Unfortunately, she didn't get the balloons. It was also a bad night for singers with their original songs. Nonceba, who was inspired by last year's Vhudie whose story has been success sang her own song, but got four nos. Another contestant, Katlego sang her original song dedicated to her ex-boyfriend, she also got four nos. Nonelela also sang her own song and got a no too. Gospel powerhouse, Ntokozo Mbambo was this week's guest judge and she graced the show with her voice twice when she sang her hit single, Jehovah Is Your Name and Celine Dion's The Power of Love. Award-winning singer, Ringo Madlingozi will be the guest judge next week.
