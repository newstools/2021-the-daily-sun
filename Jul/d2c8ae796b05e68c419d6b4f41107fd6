TOP journalist, singer and author Mzilikazi Wa Afrika has just released his fifth album. The album titled Rise dropped on Friday, 2 July. The album has 25 hits featuring different musicians from all over Africa. “This is my fifth album and it is a wake-up call for all Africans to rise up and take their rightful place under the sun and fight for their rights. I worked with a number of musicians. Musicians and artists are eyes and ears of the society. Life is my greatest motivation. I write and compose my songs about all the good and bad things that life has to offer,” he said. Last year, Mzilikazi produced a song titled Ngiyeza for duo Rafiki, featuring three-time Grammy Award winners Soweto Gospel Choir and Oluhle Ncube. He also co-directed the music video for the song.
