SOUTH African Football Association (Safa) vice president Ria Ledwaba has penned a book titled Not Without a Struggle. She said it was about her humble beginnings right up to her current position as football boss. “Most people don’t know who Ria is. They only know Ria the owner of the football club Ria Stars and Ria the Safa vice president. “So the purpose of the book is to introduce Ria the person.” She said the book was based on her background. “It will take the reader back to my childhood. The book tells the story of a young girl who grew up in poverty and went to school without shoes and hungry. But she achieved her ultimate dream,” she said. According to Ria, the book has been in the pipeline for over five years.  “It has always been my dream to write this book. It carries my voice and is a legacy I’d like to leave for the next generation,” Ria described the book as inspirational, motivational and educational.

I’d therefore encourage people to buy it once it’s out.” Ria said her next book would focus on her career as a football boss. “This biography doesn’t dwell much on my football career. ‘This is because I plan to write a second book, which will be a tell-all about my football career. “Including my football career in this biography would have been too much for the reader and probably confused them. Hence I felt I needed to separate my personal life from my business life.” The book is scheduled to be launched in Ria’s birthday month of September.
