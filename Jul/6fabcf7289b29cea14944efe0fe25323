A 39-year-OLD Newport man was arrested in the early hours of the morning after he was involved in a single-vehicle crash. This happened on 26 June at an intersection of Southfield and Allen Road, where a cop discovered the driver struck a pole. According to TheNewsHerald.com, the driver said he was returning home from downtown Detroit in the US and had been drinking. The cop then did an alcohol test. After doing poorly on the tests and registering a 0.18 blood-alcohol level, he was then arrested for drunk driving. It’s reported the driver told the officer he didn’t have insurance for the car, and then the cop discovered his licence was suspended.
