VETERAN midfielder Granwald Scott and Marc van Heerden have followed Robyn Johannes in getting their contracts with Stellenbosch FC extended until the end of the coming DStv Premiership season. Both players contracts had expired last month but Stellies, who struggled for much of last season, have ensured that the experienced duo will be with the club next season. Van Heerden, who reunited with coach Steve Barker at Stellies who he worked with at AmaZulu, featured in 28 of the 30 league matches, scoring three goals in the process, not a bad return from the full back. Scott (33) who has been hampered by injuries, started only eight of the 22 league matches. But he finished the season strongly, starting and completing the last two matches against TS Galaxy and Golden Arrows. As previously confirmed by SunSport, the club tied down Johannes, whose contract also expired at the end of last month. However, Johannes, who is the club skipper, is nursing a long-term injury he sustained in March which sidelined him for the remainder of last season. The retention of these players follows that of classy Argentine midfielder Junior Mendieta, whose loan deal from Lanus II has been made permanent. Meanwhile, the club has since parted ways with Asavela Mbekile, Phathutshedzo Nange (back to Kaizer Chiefs after his loan spell expired), Kristopher Bergman and Azeemud-Deen Brenner.
