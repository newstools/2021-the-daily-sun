Former president Jacob Zuma has made his first public appearance since the Constitutional Court sentenced him to 15 months in jail and ordered him to hand himself over to police within five days. Zuma surprised his supporters outside his home in Nkandla, northern KZN, when he came out holding his traditional stick and shield singing. He was surrounded by amabutho as they paraded outside his home.  A few minutes after he made his appearance, his friend and suspended ANC secretary general Ace Magashule arrived at Nkandla to show his support. Magashule arrived after the ANC leadership in KZN including chairman Sihle Zikalala, secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli and regional chairman Musa Dladla had just had a meeting with Zuma.  Zuma didn’t speak to his supporters but his son, Edward, took to the mobile stage stationed outside Zuma’s home to tell the supporters that there will be bloodshed should anyone touch Zuma. “Let us be ready to fight. The time to talk or negotiate is over,” he said. ANC Ehlanzeni regional leader Michael “Ngrayi” Ngwenya told Daily Sun that they drove all the way from Mpumalanga to defend Zuma. “We will die for Zuma and no will touch him. We have been here since yesterday and our mandate is clear – to defend Zuma from the biased Constitution,” he said.
