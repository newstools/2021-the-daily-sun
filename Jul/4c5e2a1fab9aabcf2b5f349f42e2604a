AMAZULU president, Sandile Zungu, said his club will join Orlando Pirates to become the second DStv Premiership side to launch their own App next month, where fans can log in and read the latest updates about Usuthu. The Umlazi-born Zungu also confirmed they will reveal a new sponsorship, new players, plus a new kit and announce the players who have left the club. This will be a busy season for Usuthu. After finishing second in the Premiership, the club will feature in the Caf Champions League for the first time, alongside Premiership winners Mamelodi Sundowns. Zungu also expects Usuthu, under coach Benni McCarthy, to improve on the 54 points they accumulated last season. “On 5 August, we have a big press conference where we’ll reveal our new players, players we released, new sponsors, and our new kit for this coming season,” said Zungu. “We’ll also reveal an App for Usuthu. Fans who want to know more about the club will be able to download the App. It will be a big day for the club.” SunSport has revealed that they have so far signed Keagan Buchanan, Mxolisi Kunene – both from Maritzburg United – and Tercious Malepe, who is the captain of the SA Under-23 side at the Tokyo Olympics Games, which starts tomorrow. Meanwhile, Usuthu, who started their pre-season two weeks ago, will start their preparation in earnest this week. They will hold a camp in Mpumalanga for two weeks. McCarthy, who was given more time off to be with his wife in Scotland, has returned to Durban. However, Siyethemba Sithebe and Veli Mothwa are to be given more time off after helping Bafana Bafana win the Cosafa Cup at the weekend. Sithebe and Mothwa were named Player and Goalkeeper of the Tournament, respectively, for Bafana under caretaker coach Morena Ramoreboli.
