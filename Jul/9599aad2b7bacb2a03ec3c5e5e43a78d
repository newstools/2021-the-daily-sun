ONE shack dweller was killed and scores were left homeless when fire ate up to 200 shacks at Marikana squatter camp in Cato Manor in Durban on Thursday, 8 July. The fire was allegedly started by a stove that was left on in one of the shacks. The shack was apparently locked. One dweller, Bhekuyise Mthiyane (56), said he was the first to see the fire breaking out at his neighbour’s shack and alerted other dwellers. “I saw a smoke coming out of the shack next door to mine and I went to investigate. I saw the door was locked from outside and I tried to break it but I couldn’t. I called other dwellers to come and help but the blaze was too strong and we had to run for our lives,” said Bhekuyise. He said he didn’t even had time to take his belongings out of his shack because the flame was moving very fast. “I grabbed my phone and my ID and ran for my life. Everything was destroyed. We are not sure what started the fire but we suspect the stove was left on,” said Bhekuyise. Another dweller, Nokuthula Hadebe (25), said she lost everything in the fire. “I was scared to take things out because the blaze was big and very brutal,” said Nokuthula. One person who has not yet been identified was killed. Its not clear whether he was trying to run away as he was found in one of the passages. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said an inquest docket is being investigated by Cato Manor police. “On Thursday in Cato Crest informal settlement, over 200 shacks caught fire. An unidentified man was burnt beyond recognition. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” said Mbele.
