Following the #FreeZuma protests in certain parts of the country, particularly KwaZulu-Natal, I would like to state that this does not appear to be a protest as is claimed, but these are pure criminal acts. The fact that businesses are targeted and shops looted is proof that the intention is to steal â€“ not to display unhappiness over the arrest of former president Jacob Zuma. If this was a protest, there would not be any looting. Criminals burning trucks and buildings while looting should not hide behind the protest. Their intention is to cause havoc, steal and make the country ungovernable. Law enforcement officers should treat these incidents as criminal acts. Let all perpetrators be brought to book, because lawlessness can never be ignored. The burning of property reverses the gains the country has been making. Jobs and economic opportunities are being arrested by people who rejoice over committing crime behind a false campaign. Crime can never be justified. - Letter by Malphia Honwane - Gottenburg, Manyeleti
