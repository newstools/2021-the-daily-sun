FORMER SuperSport United defenders Ricardo Katza and Phil Evans are happy to have been part of Pitso Mosimane’s coaching success from the beginning. Mosimane, who started his coaching career at SuperSport in the 2001-02 season, became the most successful African coach after he helped Al Ahly win their 10th Caf Champions League title when they thumped Kaizer Chiefs 3-0 in Morocco on Saturday. It was Mosimane’s second Champions League title with Ahly after winning it with the Egyptian giants last year, and third overall after he claimed it with Mamelodi Sundowns in 2016. Evans and Katza were part of Mosimane’s first triumph, winning the SAA Supa8 final against Chiefs in the 2004-05 season. SuperSport reached three cup finals on top of the SAA that season. They won the Absa Cup but lost the Coca-Cola Cup final to Chiefs. “He deserves what is coming his way at the moment,” said Evans. “He was always an up to date, obsessive coach. He had a natural desire to win and there’s no surprise to see where he is right now. I won’t be surprised if he ends up coaching in Europe. “One is happy that we were part of his formative coaching career. “When Pitso took over we just went up and up. This is because he works so hard.” There were question marks about the first Champions League he won last year with Ahly. He took charge when the Egyptian giants were in the semi-finals. Having started this year’s competition from the start, Katza said there are no excuses now. “I know when he came to Ahly, some were saying he came in the middle of the season and he was doing someone else’s work,” said Katza. “But now what are they going to say this year? So I’m not surprised at all.” Against Chiefs, it was Mosimane’s 51st game in charge of Ahly. He has won 37 matches, drawn 10 and lost only four.
