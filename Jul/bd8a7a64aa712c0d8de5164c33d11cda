IT’S been a few dry days in some parts of Tshwane. This as some areas experienced water interruptions caused by an explosion at a Rand Water pump station on Sunday. Rand Water released a statement, saying three medium voltage motors used to run the pumps exploded, resulting in the pumps at Palmiet Pumping Station becoming inoperable. “The cause of the explosion is still unknown, and a root cause analysis is currently being investigated. Emergency repairs are being carried out,” the statement read. Mabopane resident Lethabo Motsepe (32) said they had not had water for three days now. “This is very stressful. It’s like being in a village but paying services. I haven’t had a proper bath in days and this is not healthy. The worst part is that we’re fighting a virus that requires us to constantly wash our hands. Yet here we are, struggling with water,” she said. Another resident from Soshanguve, Molefe Songwane (45), said this problem had to be resolved. “We have to wait for tanks so we can fill up our buckets. We don’t have a choice but to do that because we can’t live without water. Some elderly people can’t go out and look for water,” he said. City spokesman Lindela Mashigo said Rand Water notified the city on Monday about the infrastructure failure which affected its water pumping capacity. It was only able to supply 55% normal daily supply volume. “Rand Water has emphasised that if the call to reduce water consumption is not heeded, there will not be sufficient water to supply municipalities. Reservoirs will run dry. The city’s water reservoir levels will also drop and ultimately run dry – a situation that will lead to inevitable water supply interruptions,” he said.
