AWARD-WINNING actor Motlatsi Mafatshe has scored himself a major acting gig. The actor, best known for his role as Sechaba Moloi on SABC 3’s canned soapie Isidingo, will join the cast of e.tv’s new drama series, House of Zwide, where he will play Molefe, a problematic uncle. Speaking to Daily Sun, Motlatsi said: “I was excited when I was approached for the role. “I’m working for an amazing production company that produced some of the show that influenced the actor that I am today, and I could not say no to that.” The talented actor described his character as someone who’s always in trouble but very kind and comedic. “Molefe is that uncle we all have in the family, who is always in trouble, but we love him so much as he is the glue of the family who shares pearls of wisdom every now and then,” said Motlatsi. The 37-year-old actor said stepping into Molefe’s shoes was easy because he did a lot of research about the character. “I chilled a lot ekasi and engaged with the type of people I would be playing on screen, to learn about their habits and how they conduct themselves so that when I get on set I am able to execute it as honest as possible.” ALSO READ | LETOYA AND WIFE FIGHT BACK Motlatsi, who also presents Mzansi Magic’s new reality series Unefa, said juggling the two shows has been hectic.
