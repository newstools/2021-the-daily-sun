MULTITALENTED duo, producer Letlhogonolo “Tlhoks” Moloi (33) and composer Nelisiwe Ngcobo (39), are set to release an amapiano song titled Themba Lam. Nelisiwe and Tlhoks have been recording songs throughout May, and have now decided to release their work. Tlhoks said Themba Lam is a song about love and hope. “The song is suitable for couples who are in long-distance relationships. It aims to bring hope and a spark into the relationship. It encourages couples to keep trusting and loving each other,” he said. The artists have been in the music industry for some time, but only met this year. Nelisiwe is from Newcastle in KZN, while Tlhoks is from Magong Village in the North West. “We were destined to meet and work together because we come from two different provinces. We met by grace and I have no doubt that our collaboration is going far. “Prior to this, I was pursuing my dreams in acting. One day I will continue to pursue my acting dreams but for now, my focus is on music,” said Nelisiwe, who started singing at the age of 11. “As I grew older, I started composing my own songs,” she said.

My goal was to make it big in the music industry and make a name for myself. “I haven’t fulfilled my dream, but I’m still hungry for success,” he said. One of his biggest industry highlights was the launch of his album, Re Bine. “I launched this album at the Joburg Theatre in 2019. “It has eight tracks and is suitable for everyone. I am proud of this album because it assured me that I deserved to be in the industry,” he said. Tlhoks told SunBuzz that he wanted his music to touch lives, unite and change people for the better.
