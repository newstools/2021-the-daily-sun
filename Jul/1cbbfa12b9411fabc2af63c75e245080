Lloyd said they were excited to present meaningful radio to their audience. “We’re filled with joy and pride as we’re ready to serve and make a meaningful difference through everything we do. “This is while bringing back radio that is fun, meaningful and just for you. We love the music we play as well as what we do. And the best part is, we get to share it with you everyday. If we’re having fun on air, the spirit translates through the magic medium into the psyche of our listeners. It then uplifts their spirit and makes them feel great.” Lloyd said that the station would also play a meaningful role in the community through its association with the Hot Cares Charity. “With this huge reach across the Joburg region, and knowing the good hearts of our listeners, I’m confident that we can do more to help those in our community who are struggling, especially in these difficult times,” he said.
