PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has apologised to the families of the people who died at Ndofaya Mall in Meadowlands, Soweto, during last week’s looting unrest. “We are sorry that a number of our people have died. We are going to give the families the assistance they need to get through this very sad moment,” he said. Ramaphosa was speaking during his visit in Soweto, where he led clean-up and rebuilding operations at affected malls. He said they had learnt important lessons from the unrest, with the most important one being that they needed to tighten security forces.  “We must also ensure the defence of our democracy is firmly in the hands of our people. It is you, the people of our country, who will continue to defend that democracy. “People who did this (organised the unrest) were well-organised. They came with grinders and guns to attack our democracy and ravish our constitution. “We must never allow anyone to destroy our democracy.” Ramaphosa said the next step was to rebuild and find a way to support affected businesses and people who lost their jobs. Resident Irene Makoro said it was important for the president to see what had happened in Soweto, and she appreciated the promises he made. Irene didn’t blame the looters, but rebuked those who damaged shops. “People are hungry because they have lost jobs. The president has stopped the R350 Covid-19 relief fund, which might have also added to the looting. People flock to funerals despite the restrictions because they are hungry and hoping for food.”
