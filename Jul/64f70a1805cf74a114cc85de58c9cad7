BAROKA coach Thoka Matsimela says his new signing Athenkosi Dlala is the man to fill the void left by his star midfielder, Goodman Mosele. The 23-year-old Western Cape-born player joined Bakgaga from GladAfrica Championship outfit University of Pretoria on a three-year contract. “We have been following Dlala’s career closely and we see him as the right player to fill Mosele’s position next season,” said Matsimela. “I have watched him and he is very good on the ball and works intelligently. I am impressed with what I’ve seen from him and I no longer worry about Mosele leaving us for Orlando Pirates. “I think he will add huge value for us next season. I’m positive that he will do well for us. “It’s unfortunate that he missed out in the SA Under-23 squad for the Olympic Games. But he has moved on and is working hard preparing for next season.” On Mosele joining Bucs, Matsimela, who worked with the 21-year-old for the past four years at Baroka, said: “We had a good time with him and he has grown as a player and I believe he will do well at Pirates. We wish him all the best in his future.” Another player set to leave the Limpopo outfit is their star striker, Evidence “Tower” Makgopa when he returns from the Olympic Games. The Bafana Bafana player has been linked with a move to either Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns or Kaizer Chiefs. But Bucs are believed to be winning the fight for Makgopa’s signature.
