Many people are qualified but still can’t find work due to the high unemployment rate. This has led to scammers taking advantage of desperate jobseekers. Among the victims of these scams is Violet Matheka ( 34) from Mmakau Village in North West. She’s in debt after borrowing money to pay for a job. “My neighbour, a doctor at George Mukhari Hospital, was checking on me and my mum told him I’m struggling to find work.” She said the neighbour told her there was a man who could get her a job at the hospital. “He gave me the guy’s number and I contacted him. The man told me I needed to pay R2 000 for a medical examination before getting the job,” said Violet. She said the man told her to meet him at Kalafong Hospital in Atteridgeville for the examination. “I deposited R1 500 into his account and waited for him to get back to me but then he just went missing,” she said. Violet said when she called her neighbour, he started ducking and diving. “I’ve been asking him to pay me back as he’s directed me to the scammer.” “I knew there were scammers but I thought this guy was genuine because I was told about him by someone I know.” Daily Sun tried to call the neighbour but his phone went straight to voicemail. When the SunTeam called the alleged scammer, he said: “I’m a medical student and I have an exam. I don’t have time to answer these questions.” Hospital spokesman Thuso Montwedi said: “Government jobs are not for sale and no one should have to pay to get a job.” The hospital has launched an internal probe.
