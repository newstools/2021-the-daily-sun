The greediness of the chief looters, those who loot state resources, are to be blamed for hooliganism mushrooming in KZN and Gauteng. We all know an idle brain is the devil’s workshop. If all those people were employed and earning a decent salary, they would think twice before jeopardising their jobs and tarnishing their images by being involved in criminal acts in the name of former president, Jacob Zuma. Proverbs 29:2 says: “...when the wicked rule, the people mourn” and that is what has been happening in our country. People are expressing their frustrations and vulnerability to poverty. If their conditions are not addressed and fixed, the scourge will remain. Our country has turned into a jungle where it’s survival of the fittest. No comrade will ever save our country. Only genuine leaders will.
