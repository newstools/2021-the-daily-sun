THE National Professional Teachers’ Organisation of South Africa (Naptosa) is calling for harsher sentences for people who looted, vandalised and burnt schools during the ongoing riots in KZN. A school in Pinetown was burnt to the ground while 31 other schools in KZN were looted and vandalised. The looters stole items such as computers, office equipment and furniture. NAPTOSA director Basil Manuel said they are sickened by images of a school in KZN burned to the ground, and the reason apparently being that people were looking for food. Equally shocking is the great number of schools that have been looted. Stealing objects and equipment from a school is contemptible, but stealing the future of innocent children,” said Manuel. He said the time for harsher sentences to the people who vandalised school has arrived. ALSO READ: AMADLOZI
PUT MY 4-5 TO SLEEP! “It needs to be elevated to something more telling for which more severe and deterrent sentences can be imposed and where the damage it causes children, becomes an aggravating factor,” he said. KZN South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) secretary Nomarashiya Caluza said it was unfortunate that these schools are looted by locals who might have children attending the school. She said this is a major set back as some schools in the province still don’t have proper infrastructure.

It is disappointing that people have the courage to burn or loot what the department tried to improve. Now the money to improve schools will have to be used to rebuild burnt classes and buy looted equipment to ensure that teaching and learning will not be interrupted,” said Caluza. KZN Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said the statistics of the damaged properties are being updated by the office of the premier.
