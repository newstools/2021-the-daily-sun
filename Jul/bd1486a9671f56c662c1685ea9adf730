KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala has appealed to people to stop looting as the damage has increased to an estimated R3 billion plus. Zikalala visited some looting hot spots on Wednesday, 14 July, where they managed to make arrests after catching looters red-handed. He said: “The looting has to stop, and it has to stop now!” A preliminary investigation of the losses so far has been done. “This is not a final figure, as we are still in the process of collating the final figures. We estimate the damage to be more than R3 billion,” said Zikalala.  Zikalala started in Cato Ridge, where he witnessed the massive damage to property and the extent of looting. He then proceeded to Westmead in Pinetown before visiting Springfield Park after Springfield Value Centre was looted and set alight.  He said: “The damage we have seen with our own eyes is massive and we can safely say it amounts to several billions in damage to property and looted stock.” Zikalala said these scary scenes left him worried as the destruction was going to lead to massive jobs losses in KZN and the rest of the country. “This destruction is going to deter investors from investing in capital and infrastructure,” said Zikalala.
