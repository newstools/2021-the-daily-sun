Former
Bosasa COO-turned-whistleblower Angelo Agrizzi and former ANC MP Vincent Smith
will be tried separately in the corruption and fraud case. On
Thursday, the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court sitting in the Palm Ridge
Magistrate's Court granted the State's application for a separation of the
trial due to Agrizzi's ill health. Agrizzi
appeared alongside Smith in October last year, with a small oxygen device. He
has since failed to appear due to ill health. His lawyer
Mannie Witz said they didn't object to the separation of trial application. "We
don't want to delay and deny Mr Smith and the company that he represents the
rights to a speedy trial and a fair trial in terms of Section 35 of the
Constitution," Witz said. "...it
is just a separation of trials and if and when and once his medical
condition... can improve then the State can then decide to proceed against him
but they don't want to delay in all fairness." The matter
was postponed to 28 September. The State
is also expected to prosecute Smith on charges of tax fraud and tax evasion. His lawyer
Wikus Steyl previously said there were no grounds for these charges, News24
reported. Agrizzi and
Smith are charged with corruption, while Smith faces additional charges of
fraud for alleged payments made to his company Euroblitz in 2015 and 2016. The State
alleges the payments were made to Smith to silence his opposition to Bosasa
during parliamentary committee meetings. Smith has
pleaded not guilty and maintains the money was a loan from Agrizzi, which
Agrizzi denies. SOURCE:
