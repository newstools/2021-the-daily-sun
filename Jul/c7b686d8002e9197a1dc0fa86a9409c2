BURUNDI referee Pacifique Ndabihawenimana will be in charge when underdogs Kaizer Chiefs meet Egyptâ€™s Al Ahly in the African Champions League final at the Mohamed V Stadium in Casablanca, Morocco on 17 July. His appointment was confirmed by the Confederation of Africa Football (Caf), who also announced Elvis Guy Noupe Nguegoue of Cameroon as the first assistant referee and Lee Okello from Uganda as the second assistant referee. The fourth official is Eric Arnaud Otogo Castane from Gabon. The match commissioner is Ali Konate Aboubakar, who is also from Cameroon. Ndabihawenimana is no stranger to Amakhosi. It will be the third time the Burundian referee will officiate in a match involving Chiefs in the Champions League this season. He was the man in the middle when Chiefs came home with a goalless draw against Primeiro de Agosto of Angola in the first leg, first round in December. He was in charge when Chiefs lost 3-0 to Simba SC of Tanzania in the second leg of the quarter-finals in Tanzania. Amakhosi thumped Simba 4-0 in the first leg to progress to the semi-finals. The 36-year-old also officiated in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
