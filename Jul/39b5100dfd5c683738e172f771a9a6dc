Miss South Africa 2020 Shudufhadzo Musida graduated today with a BA Honours in International Relations from the University of the Witwatersrand. The graduation ceremony was held virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, Musida was a guest of the Wits Vice Chancellor, Professor Zeblon Vilakazi. There were celebratory whoops of joy accompanied tears of happiness as Musida received her degree in the same week that she celebrated her birthday. An excited Shudu said the day was the culmination of a dream that her beloved great grandmother had for her. “Growing up in Ha-Masia, deep in the heart of Vhembe District in Limpopo, my Gugu always stressed that education was a fundamental stepping stone to success. How proud she would have been of me, her little Abi (I was known as Abigail as a child), who has earned this university degree," she said. Musida also has Bachelor of Social Science degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from the University of Pretoria.
