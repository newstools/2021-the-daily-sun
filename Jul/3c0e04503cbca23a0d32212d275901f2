THE Constitutional Court must suspend a warrant of arrest against former president Jacob Zuma until it hears and ruled on his application to rescind his sentence. This was the application by Zuma’s lawyers to the highest court in the latest attempt by the former president to stay out of jail as the clock was ticking for the deadline for police to arrest him after he failed to hand himself over by Sunday. The lawyers in the letter to the Constitutional Court said alternatively the court should wait for a ruling of the Pietermaritzburg High Court which heard his stay of arrest case but stressed that after agreeing to hear Zuma on his rescind application, it gave no directive as to what should happen should happen to the arrest warrant.

They argued that there would be prejudice against the client if he wins the stay of arrest case or if the Constitutional Court reversing his sentence. “We understand that the Constitutional Court may direct the suspension of its orders, which if granted will be binding to the high court, to prevent our client from being arrested prior to all legal processes being finalized,” it said.
