WHEN the ANC came into power, South Africans were promised heaven on earth. But the country is now being led by a party more concerned with its own internal politics than fulfilling promises. Former president Jacob Zuma continues to be a thorn in the ANC as the NEC plans to meet to discuss his future. When the Constitutional Court ruled that he should serve 15 months in jail, many saw it as the end of the road for him. However, he returned to the court, which granted him a lifeline by agreeing to hear an application to revise the decision. It’s not clear whether the governing party will take a firm stance following dramatic scenes in Nkandla on Sunday, 4 July. Zuma’s supporters had gathered in Nkandla, daring the police to arrest them. On the other hand, Zuma is blaming the judiciary for his bad luck. Rumours have it that the NEC is due to discuss a deal with him, which might see him avoiding jail. It remains to be seen whether the ANC will have any say. On Tuesday, 6 July, the Pietermaritzburg High Court will hear whether the arrest warrant against Zuma should be put on ice while he returns to the Constitutional Court. Police Minister Bheki Cele told reporters the cops would wait for directions from the court, as the matter was in its hands.
