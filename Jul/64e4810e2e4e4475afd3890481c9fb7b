KAIZER Chiefs winger Happy Mashiane is pumped up for the biggest game of his career so far. The 23-year-old is looking forward to playing in the final of the Caf Champions League. He will be hoping to make the team that will face Al Ahly in the final set to take place at the Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca, Morocco on Saturday. Amakhosi will have to bring their A-game against Pitso Mosimane’s Red Devils who are targeting their second straight title. The Egyptian giants, who have won this trophy a record nine times, are eager to extend that record at the expense of Amakhosi. But Mashiane insists that they do not intend on letting that happen. “We worked very hard to reach the final,” said Mashiane. “But we have to work even harder now to win the trophy. We have promised many people that we are going to take this trophy back home so we have to work extra hard.” Amakhosi are in unfamiliar territory, reaching the final for the very first time in their history. They have surprised a lot of people enroute to the final but they will hope to have left the biggest for last. The final, set to be played at a neutral venue, will mean both sides will be without home support. Mashiane insists that this is not ideal but they will do their best to make their supporters proud. “We do feel the vibe of our supporters,” added Mashiane. “But we as players will never get used to playing, especially a final like this one, without our supporters. "The game of football depends on the supporters for the atmosphere. It won’t be great to play without them. It won’t be easy but we will fight extremely hard.”
