A DRUNK driver who allegedly killed three pedestrians in Parkgate in Phoenix, north of Durban, was handed over to the police after being assaulted by a crowd. According to Reaction Unit South Africa spokesman Prem Balram, two pedestrians were killed instantly while the third one died in hospital after they were run over by a drunk driver in B Section, Parkgate, on Saturday. Balram said they received multiple calls at about 10pm from residents requesting assistance for the injured. He said the reaction unit officers and paramedics were sent to the scene, where they found an angry crowd assaulting a man who had been stripped naked. “It was established that he was the driver of the white Toyota Corolla involved in the accident. He abandoned his damaged vehicle and fled the scene on foot when he was pursued by a mob and apprehended about 300m away. They began assaulting while escorting him back to the scene,” said Balram. He said that the paramedics assessed the injured and found that two pedestrians were fatally injured. “According to residents, the vehicle was travelling at high speed when the driver lost control and ploughed into the pedestrians. His vehicle then crashed into a tree. The pedestrians landed several metres away from the point of impact,” said Balram. He said the driver was allegedly drinking alcohol at a local shebeen before the accident. “The suspect was handed over to the police and the seriously injured pedestrians were transported to hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries,” said Balram. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated by Verulam cops. “It’s alleged that on Saturday on Tottenham Road in Parkgate, three men in their 20s died after they were knocked down by a vehicle. Circumstances surrounding the incident are still being investigated,” said Gwala.
