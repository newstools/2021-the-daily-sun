BAROKA youngster, Tshegofatso “Viera” Bodega, is aiming to emulate his teammate Evidence “Tower” Makgopa who did well after being promoted to the first team two seasons ago. The 18-year-old midfielder has been promoted to Thoka Matsimela’s team for next season and is confident he won’t disappoint. Makgopa played for Bakgaga’s first team at the age of 19 and now he is the most in-demand youngster in the DStv Premiership as big teams such as Mamelodi Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates are fighting for his signature. The 21-year-old has also made it to coach David Notoane’s Under-23 squad for the Tokyo Olympic Games in Japan. Makgopa also underlined his potential when he scored a brace in his debut for Bafana Bafana when they beat Uganda 3-2 in the international friendly last month. “Makgopa has inspired many of us at Baroka’s development team,” Bodega said. “Everyone is working hard to achieve what Makgopa is doing, having showed that you don’t have to play for a big team to play for Bafana.” Added the Ga-Mashashane born player: “This is a dream come true for me to play in the PSL. I am going to work hard. My goal is to play regularly and win trophies and also play for the national teams. I know I can achieve that as long as I work hard.” However, it is unlikely that Bosega will play with Makgopa as his teammate at Baroka next season. Makgopa, who hails from Ga-Mampha, is set to join one of the bigger Premiership teams when he returns from the Olympic Games. Baroka also promoted Thabiso Bobete from their development squad to the first team.
