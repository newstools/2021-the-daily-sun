ORLANDO Pirates’ new recruit Bandile Shandu is under no illusions about the step up he has made in his career and what the demands will be at his new club. The former Maritzburg United star is aware that he will face a different kind of pressure at the Soweto giants from what he was used to at his previous club. The 26-year-old has made well over a hundred appearances for the Team of Choice during his time in KwaZulu Natal but will be taking on a new challenge next season. He joined Bucs on a free transfer after running down his contract at Maritzburg. “It’s difficult because of the quality that Orlando Pirates has, but I’ll keep doing what’s worked for me up until this point,” Shandu told the club’s website. “I always strive to work hard, do the basics right, and follow the coach’s instructions. “Basically, just try and add value and do whatever is required by the team to the best of my ability. So, I’m just willing to do that and contribute to the team’s cause, and make sure that we achieve a lot in the upcoming season. “Pirates is a big club – one of the biggest in South Africa. So, I’m expecting a different type of pressure. I know there is a demand for results, and I’m aware that I have to do my best to contribute to positive results for the team. “I’m really honoured to be playing for Orlando Pirates. What I can promise is that each time I’m on the pitch, I’ll always give 100 per cent and ensure that the fans are happy.”
