WITH  what is happening in the country, Safa President Danny Jordaan believes that Kaizer Chiefs winning the Caf Champions League title will give the country so much needed good news. Mzansi is reeling from the worst unrest and looting, which has been going on for days. ‘’This match is historical for Kaizer Chiefs, and it would be tremendous for Amakhosi to win this Edition. There has been so much happening in the country, depressing developments and winning the Champions Trophy would give South Africans much needed good news,’’ said Dr Jordaan. Amakhosi will face Egyptian giants in the final scheduled meeting at Mohammed V Stadium in Morocco on Saturday night (9pm). Jordaan said he would want Chiefs to win this title and alluded that South Africa would still have won somewhere somehow if they fail to do so. Ahly are under the guidance of the South African duo of Pitso Mosimane and Cavin Johnson, meaning on either side, the South African flag will be hoisted sky high, according to o Jordaan. “To the technical team (of Kaizer Chiefs), support staff and players, I want to wish you all the best in Morocco. You have come this far, so go there and enjoy yourself. Make the country proud. South Africa seriously need some positive lift,” he added. “Believe in yourself and play for the club’s badge, your country, family and for your careers. In Kaizer Chiefs we believe.” Chiefs will become a third SA team to win this title if it happens they manage to bring down Ahly on the day. They will follow the steps of Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns, who have won it before. “Kaizer has done tremendous work for South African football, and winning the CAF Champions League title will be a befitting reward for the hard work he has dedicated to the game. He is an icon of South African football, and I wish him all the best,’’ stated Jordaan.
