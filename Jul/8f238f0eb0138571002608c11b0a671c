WHEN they couldn’t find jobs, they came up with a plan. The group of seven young people started cultivating vegetables on a piece of unused land. Albert Mashaba (32) said he and his friends decided to create their own jobs and started working the land in Nkangala near Bronkhorstspruit in 2018. He said they sold their produce door-to-door and supplied vendors. “The unemployment rate is very high and this was the only way to survive.  “We started this project with our own money,” he said. “We claimed this land and have the title deed but instead of putting shacks up, we started planting vegetables. “We rotate crops according to the season. “In summer, we produce maize, watermelons, beans and peanuts.” Albert’s partner, Dumsani Thubani, (35) said they faced many challenges and needed support from the government. “We realised the money is in the soil and we had to do something to make a living. We have utilised this land but we are struggling without any support.” “We rely on dams on the land to irrigate our vegetables. We are pleading with the government to help us with fencing. There is livestock here and our crops are not safe. We have to plough by hand with hoes and a tractor would be handy.” Dumisani said they needed a water engine, pumps and pipes to irrigate their crops. “We are using a furrow irrigation system and when the water pressure is strong, it washes away the fertiliser and causes erosion. We are also asking for seeds. “This is the only way we can deal with the unemployment issue.” Other young people taking part in the project are David Msiza (26), Lungisani Masanabo (26) and Mbali Komani (20). They said they started by clearing the land and digging with hoes.
