AL AHLY coach Pitso “Jingles” Mosimane believes his team showed more hunger and determination than their opponents Kaizer Chiefs in their Caf Champions League final. Mosimane’s Red Devils eased past The Glamour Boys in Morocco, walking away 3-0 winners at the Mohammed V Stadium. They clinched their second consecutive Champions League title and their tenth overall, extending their record in the process. Amakhosi could not get over the line in what was their maiden appearance in the final. Mosimane insists that his side “wanted it more.” "We really needed this trophy; I know the Chief of my country also wanted their first star, but we wanted it more than them," said Mosimane in a virtual presser after the match. "The tenth one is important. It's good for our history, it's good for our archives. And how better to do it with three goals. Mosimane admitted that the red card to Chiefs youngster Happy Mashiane on the stroke of halftime made things much easier for them. Mashiane was given a straight red card after a dangerous tackle on just before the halftime interval, a moment that swung the game in Ahly’s favour. And Mosimane’s side took full advantage of the situation. Mohamed Sherif, Mohamed Afsha, and Amr El Solia all got on the scoresheet for the Egyptian giants who were smelling blood and went for the kill. "Yes, I understand, there was a red card, but red cards are part of football,” added Mosimane. “You should not be reckless when you play the cup final, you should not be too emotional, and this happens in football.” "We deserve it. We won it. We've been scoring goals in the semi-finals. We've been scoring goals all the way. Al Ahly deserves the tenth trophy to make history." Mosimane is now the most successful African coach in the competition with three titles to his name.
