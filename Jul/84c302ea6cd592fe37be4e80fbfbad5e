Dear MizzB I’M 22 years old and I’ve been with my boyfriend for more than two years now. The problem is his family doesn’t like me at all and I don’t even know why. I’m thinking of ending the relationship because this is breaking my heart. He’s also not doing anything about it. Please help. Dear Sista Relationships can be complicated, especially with the involvement of the families. Some parents feel it’s their responsibility to ensure their child gets the best in life. Keep in mind it’s not always their intention to dislike you, but it’s simply the perception they might have of you. Maternal instincts at times tend to take over and parents then become overprotective. The survival of a relationship is dependent on both partners’ willingness to fight for it to grow. Your boyfriend needs to address his family’s involvement as much as you do. Counselling will provide a platform for both of you to express your feelings. All the best!
