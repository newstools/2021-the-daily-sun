ACTRESS Lusanda Mbane is leaving etv’s much-loved soapie Scandal! The talented actress, who plays Boniswa Langa, is set to exit the show after a five-year run. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said being part of the show has been an honour. “What a journey and a ride it has been. Five years ago I took on this queen, Boniswa Langa, who cared about nothing else but the well-being of her family. Little did I know she would evolve into the cold and calculated villain that our audiences have come to love-to-hate,” she said. The actress further said she loved and enjoyed every single moment playing Boniswa. “From getting to know her right through to becoming her as I searched deep within to find this queen of darkness, her strengths, her fears, her motivation, I found so much more within. I found me, my own light and I am proud to walk away knowing that no one can ever take that away from me,” said Lusanda. ALSO READ |   RIP MUTODI NESHEHE!
