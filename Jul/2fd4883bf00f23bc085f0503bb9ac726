I’m pleading with everyone to help pensioners register for vaccination. Covid-19 cases are rising on a daily basis, and the roll-out programme is slow. Everyone needs an elderly person in their life. So if we appreciate them, this is the time to show it, even if it means accompanying them to vaccination centres. We must appreciate and support them while they’re still alive. Let’s also discourage them from the myths and misinformation on the vaccine. Everyone must get involved to help the elderly register and get vaccinated
