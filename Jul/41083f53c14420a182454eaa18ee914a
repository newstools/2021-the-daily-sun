Y ESTERDAY the Acting Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni said the police have arrested an alleged instigator behind the looting. Ntshavheni was giving an update on the ongoing unrest in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. She said the suspect was currently behind cells and the cops were working to arrest eleven more alleged instigators. “We are pleased with the report that Gauteng is largely calm and that there have been fewer incidences this far.” Ntshavheni said 10 000 more troops were on the ground yesterday.  She said she believed that the decline in cases of violence was due to the increased deployment of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), South African Police Service and Joburg Metro Police Department in identified hot spots. At least 139 more arrests were made, taking the total number of arrests to 725 in Gauteng, and 1 478 in KwaZulu-Natal since the outbreak of the violent.
