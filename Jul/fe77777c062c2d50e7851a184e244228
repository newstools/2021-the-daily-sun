Kaizer Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter has bemoaned the red card his side received in their Caf Champions League final defeat to Al Ahly. Youngster Happy Mashiane was given a straight red card after a dangerous tackle on the stroke of halftime, a moment that swung the game in Ahly’s favour. Baxter believes it would have been a different game had Amakhosi not been dealt the huge knock of going a man down against one of the best teams on the continent. Pitso Mosimane’s Ahly took full advantage of the situation, easing to a 3-0 win in Morocco to bag their tenth title. Mohamed Sherif, Mohamed Afsha, and Amr El Solia all got on the scoresheet for the Egyptian giants who were smelling blood and went for the kill. "I thought with the challenges that we've had building up to the final, the players did really well," Baxter said in a virtual press conference after the match. "The opening of the game, we pressed high, but al Ahly were good with the ball. I thought we did that reasonably well, but we had less and less of our attacks. "We couldn't follow the plan that we've had. The red card turned out to be the killer; I had to change the game. "In the second half, they put the gas to the floor, the same time we had the handbrake on. It was a good performance by Al Ahly, but shame for us we had to deal with a red card." Baxter, who was on the bench for the first time since his return to Amakhosi, was still proud of his team for reaching their maiden final. He did, however, admit that the pain of losing a final will not go away easily as they had high hopes. "Of course, you're disappointed, massively disappointed. The players in the dressing room are massively disappointed,” added Baxter. "I'm disappointed not with their workload, but in certain situations, the quality of our play was not good enough.”
