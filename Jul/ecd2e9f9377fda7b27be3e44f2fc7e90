Dear MizzB Iâ€™M a 28-year-old guy who is in a relationship with two women. They are both older than me and I just found out they are both pregnant. How do I make them get along well since I want to continue dating both of them? Dear Brother Dating is all about honesty and open communication. You betrayed both their trust and you can only hope it will not cause you to lose both of them. Individually let them know about each other, and find out from them what they feel comfortable with. Keep in mind that not only did you lie to them, but you also risked their health by having unprotected sex with both of them. Your behaviour displays unfairness as you were only thinking about yourself. If all fails, at least negotiate co-parenting with them. All the best, brother.
