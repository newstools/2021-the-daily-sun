PLANS for the new season are already underway for SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo. By their high standards, Matsatsantsa a Pitori have underperformed in the recently concluded DStv Premiership season, although it could be argued that several factors worked against them. The team is set to lose some key players, including Teboho Mokoena and Sipho Mbule. Among those who could arrive at the Tshwane outfit are Hlompho Kekana and George Maluleka, on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns. The two barely played last season and are understood to be part of negotiations between the two clubs over the potential transfer of Mokoena, among others. Tembo is working on the plans for the new season, which is expected to start sometime next month. “We have the whole of July to prepare the team for the new season and so we have already started with our plans,” said Tembo. “We might not be able to play a lot of friendlies due to the Covid-19. And so, there will be a lot of 11 versus 11 training matches which are more in-house. “Of course, it might take a little bit of time for us to prepare the team, but we will just do it gradually. It wasn’t easy last season, but we endured the race.” Tembo came under pressure as United slipped out of contention for league honours. But he continued to enjoy the backing of club boss Stan Matthews, who pointed to the excellent job Tembo did in the transition of the team that used more players under the age of 24 than any other club in the PSL. He commended him for having the courage to give young players a chance, a move which mostly leads to a sacrifice of short-term points while a head coach pays their PSL “school fees”. Tembo has seen many youngsters from the junior ranks through to the first team, the likes of Ronwen Williams, Mokoena, Luke Fleurs and Mbule, who turned professional at a very young age.
