MAHWELERENG police in Limpopo have launched a manhunt for a rape suspect after he allegedly escaped from the hands of police who had brought him to Mokerong Magistrates Court for his court appearance. It was at about 1pm on Monday, 5 July when a police truck arrived to take 10 suspects, including Tshepo Menyuku (35), back to the cells after they had appeared. Menyuku escaped from court before he could be loaded into the police truck. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo says it was reported that a police constable was loading 10 awaiting-trial prisoners, when rape-accused Menyuku ran away and jumped over the big fence at the back of the court. Mojapelo told Daily Sun: “The suspect was already denied bail for two rape cases. A primary school pupil was raped on the way from school and a woman was also allegedly raped by the suspect.” The rape cases were committed in October 2020 at Mabula and Kadichwene villages in Bakenberg outside Mokopane. The suspect was later arrested at a local tavern in January this year. A witness who works at the court says there was no way the police were going to catch up with the suspect. “He was running very fast and quickly jumped a very high fence and disappeared in the streets of Mahwelereng,” said the witness. NPA Limpopo spokeswoman Mashudu Malabi-Dzangi said the prosecution hoped he is found and arrested before his next court date on 12 August. “It will be bad if he is not rearrested because that will delay the case further.”
