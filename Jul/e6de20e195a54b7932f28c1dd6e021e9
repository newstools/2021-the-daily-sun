ORLANDO Pirates legend Lucky Lekgwathi will not let the recent incident of looting at his Grootman Restaurant get him down. The former Bucs skipper’s store was not sparred in the recent looting that engulfed the country in the past week. His three-month-old fast-food business based in Kliptown, Soweto was turned upside down by looters. Lekgwathi was understandably shattered following the incident. But it has not stopped him from opening his heart for the community.Through his foundation, the Lucky Lekgwati Foundation, Lekgwathi honoured the elderly on Mandela Day. Against all odds, Lekgwathi refused to disappoint as he partnered with three local Non-Profit Organizations to give back to the community. Along with Pirates midfielder Linda Mntambo’s foundation, the Linda Mntambo Foundation as well as the Kasi Heroes Foundation and Nhlanhla Foundation, they donated blankets and food parcels to the local communities of Soweto. It is safe to say, Lekgwathi 's heart of gold resonates with the spirit of Mandela Day of selflessness, forgiveness and Ubuntu.
