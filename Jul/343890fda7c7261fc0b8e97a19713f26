THE South African U-23 Olympic team has arrived and settled well at the Olympic Village in Tokyo, Japan ahead of the 2020 Games that were rescheduled for this year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The team left South Africa on Tuesday afternoon for the Far East and are relishing the prospect of doing well in this year’s Games. Head coach David Notoane and his troops travelled from South Africa via Ethiopia, before connecting directly to Japan and arrived safely at modern Olympic Village. The team have kicked off their training sessions ahead of their opening game against hosts Japan on 22 July at the Tokyo Stadium (1pm, SA time). They will then play France at Saitama Stadium on 25 July (10am, SA time) before their last Group A match against Mexico three days later at the Sapporo Dome at 1pm. Coach Notoane believes that a few days of acclimatisation and rest will do the boys the world of good, which will inspire them to reach their goals. “The Village is beautiful and we have been welcomed well,” said Notoane from Japan. “We have waited so long for these Games to take place and it’s an honour for us all to be here. “The players understand that this is a prestigious event that will definitely take their careers to the next level, as playing in the Olympics is a career highlight for every player.” He admitted that jet-lag has hit them hard “and resting but the boys will be fine”. He added: “We will, in the next few days, take it easy and have light training sessions before focusing fully on our opening match against hosts Japan.” The final list of 19 players has been concluded and the Kaizer Chiefs duo of Reeve Frosler and Nkosingiphile Ngcobo will join the Olympic Team from Morocco after the Caf Champions League final against Al Ahly.
