GOLDEN Arrows have piped Kaizer Chiefs in a race to sign highly rated midfielder Saziso Magawana from GladAfrica Championship side Uthongathi FC. The 22-year-old was also wanted by Swallows FC but their offer to Magawana was not good for Magawana who turned heads with some outstanding performances last season with the Cane Cutters. Chiefs extensively showed a big interest in Magawana when Gavin Hunt was still their coach by sending their scouts to watch him in Durban. But Arrows chairperson Mato Madlala stepped in and made the player an offer he couldn’t refuse. Magawana was given guarantees that he will grow in the Arrows side next season, like Pule Mmodi, who joined Arrows at the beginning of last season from Uthongathi and has turned out to be a great acquisition. Mmodi (28) scored five goals in 28 league matches, becoming one of the unsung heroes at Abafana Bes’Thende, as they finished fourth last term with no big name players in their squad. SunSport has also learnt that Arrows have signed defender Ntsikelelo Nxadi and left back Sibonelo Cele also from Uthongathi. Arrows need to beef up the left back position as they are set to lose Devine Lunga, who is heavily linked to  join DStv Premiership Mamelodi Sundowns. Madlala has already found Magawana Nxabi and Cele a flat in Umhlanga where most of Arrows players are staying.
