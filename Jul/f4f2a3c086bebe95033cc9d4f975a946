NEW Cape Town City goalkeeper Bongani Mpandle is excited to be reunited with coach Eric Tinkler. Mpandle, who was signed by the Citizens on Tuesday, worked with Tinkler at Maritzburg United in three seasons with the Midlands club. Together they reached the final of the Telkom Knockout in the 2019-20 season but the Team of Choice lost in the final to Mamelodi Sundowns in Durban. It was that tournament where Mpandle showed he was not just a squad member for Maritzburg, as Tinkler selected him ahead of Richard Ofori. “I know coach Eric and I also know the style of football he likes to play, and I think I can help the team achieve things. He's a good guy and if he pushes you, you will get your chance to play,” said Mpandle. Mpandle (28) who had been with Maritzburg since the beginning of the 2016-17 season after he was signed from Bloemfontein Celtic, faces a battle for the number one jersey after the Mother City club signed Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Darren Keet a few days ago. City have bolstered their goalkeeping department following the departure of Peter Leeuwenburgh, who returned to the Netherlands to join FC Groningen. Mpandle says he will learn a lot from Keet who helped Bafana qualify for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Egypt. “I’m happy to be part of Cape Town City, I’m here to learn and help the team to win trophies,” he said. “I think working as a team we can achieve more. I’m happy to work with Darren.  I will learn a lot from him as he has represented the national team before.” City, who finished seventh in the DStv Premiership last season, will visit AmaZulu who finished second, in the MTN8 quarterfinals next month when the 2021-22 campaign gets underway.
