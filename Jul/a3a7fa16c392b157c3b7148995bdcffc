I would not read much to the Constitutional Court ruling for former president Jacob Zuma to go to jail. I neither weep nor celebrate this turn of events. More so when I think about how Zuma humiliated and betrayed Muammar Gaddafi in cohorts with that false black hero called Barack Obama and other puffed-up souls from the West. Moreover, it is not Zuma’s doing alone to be where we are today. I do not agree with the false claim by the ANC and media that Zuma is getting what he deserves. It was you who convinced someone who was poorly educated to run an emerging democracy, see himself as a leader and promoted him as above the legal threats against him when it suited you. Zuma’s confidence to defy the court is not incidental. Those who supported him and used his popularity include ministers Blade Nzimande, Fikile Mbalula, Pravin Gordhan and Bheki Cele. Zuma may fall on a sword he thought was his, but it actually belonged to enemies who pretended to be friends. Claims that the ruling sends a strong warning are false. Firstly, the same constitution and its constituencies provided a political solution for Zuma to be president to prevent a Zulu revolt. Secondly, Zuma has not been found guilty of any corruption charges that involve many members of the ANC after years of speculation. Thirdly, there is no guarantee that Zuma will go to prison. Finally, the fact that this judgment came after level 4 lockdown proves that there is political affiliation to the work of the judiciary. The Constitution can be amended if the majority agrees. In this regard, it can neither be trusted to exist eternally nor can it save itself when that moment arrives. The Constitution can never be our God and its existence depends on the very same people it seeks to regulate, and the political environment under which it operates. The proponents of the Constitution made a mistake by proclaiming it as above God. It will not be spared when the time comes. Mangaung, Bloemfontein
