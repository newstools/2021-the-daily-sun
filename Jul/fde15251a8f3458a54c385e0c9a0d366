President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation on Monday, 12 July, at 8pm. He will talk about the government’s response to the persistent public violence in parts of the country. Presidency spokeswoman Nonceba Mhlauli said the address by Ramaphosa would follow after the announcement by the South African National Defence Force that it has commenced with pre-deployment processes. “The request entails SANDF support for police operations in parts of KZN and Gauteng. In terms of Section 201(2)(a) of the Constitution, the president may authorise the deployment of the national defence force in co-operation with the police service and must inform parliament of such employment,” Mhlauli said.

She said the president has been on record calling for calm and has warned those involved in criminal activities that they will face the full might of the law. This comes a day after Ramaphosa addressed the nation on lockdown regulations which have been kept in place to fight the pandemic. “The majority of South Africans do not and should not tolerate violence, the destruction of property and the endangering of livelihoods. People are urged to report criminals by sharing videos of criminal activity with the police. People are also asked to pay attention to what they post on social media and to be aware that the sharing of fake news or content that incites violence and looting is a crime,” Mhlauli said.
