A MAN accused of stabbing his 46-year-old wife to death on Thursday, 1 July was found seeking the help of an inyanga the next day. The 38-year-old was bust at the home of an inyanga in Escourt, KZN. According to the victim’s relative, police were alerted by the inyanga. “We think he feared that if he didn’t alert the police that the suspect was at his home, he would have been arrested when the cops eventually found out,” the relative told Daily Sun. She said her family was relieved that the suspect had been arrested. “We feel much better. Before the arrest, we had to deal with the double pain of losing a loved one and knowing that the killer was still at large,” she said. “We know his arrest will not bring back our sister, but knowing that he’s now behind bars somehow eases the pain.” The relative said the family didn’t want the suspect to get bail. “Instead, he must get a long sentence that will teach him a lesson that you can’t kill people and get away with it.” The suspect fled immediately after allegedly stabbing the victim at their home in KwaMakhutha, south of Durban. The couple were apparently not getting along and the victim had obtained a protection order against the suspect and was staying at a neighbour’s house. On the day she was killed, she arrived at home to do her chores. She was in the process of getting a divorce and the suspect was allegedly furious as the house was owned by the victim. The body was found by a relative who saw blood stains on the veranda of the couple’s home. The relative also saw the suspect speeding off in the victim’s car. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “We can confirm that a 38-year-old murder suspect was arrested in the Wembezi area of Estcourt. He will appear in the Umbumbulu Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 7 July.”
