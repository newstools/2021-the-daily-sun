Veteran coach Sammy Troughton is to make a return to GladAfrica Championship side University of Pretoria, where he will act as a technical advisor. He will work with head coach Tlisane Motaung, where he will act as a mentor but also to improve the club’s academy system. “Twenty-one years ago I was brought in to spearhead the elite football at Tuks and it is exciting to be back at my old stomping ground,” Troughton said. “I have coached many teams around the country; I have been to Durban, Cape Town, Mpumalanga, Free State and I can honestly not say that there is any structure like the one we have at Tuks. “Between all the junior national teams, the PSL teams, players who have been selected for Bafana Bafana and Banyana Banyana, we have over a hundred exceptional players who were brought up from this system and we need to get that back. “I am not coming in through the back door as the head coach. My role is very clear, we need to get back to promoting more players from within the club than those we bring from outside. It is what has worked for us before and there is no reason why we should be deviating from that. “This is one of the few places that actually takes the position of Technical Director very seriously. I am excited at the prospect of what we can achieve together, with the support of the rest of the coaches in the club.” Troughton played a role in AmaTuks’s qualification to the PSL promotional play-offs in the 2007-08 season and their eventual elevation to the top-flight in the 2011-12 campaign. -SuperSport
