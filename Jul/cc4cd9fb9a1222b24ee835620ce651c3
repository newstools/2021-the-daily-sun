IT seems not even izangoma are safe from scammers. This comes after scammers used a photo belonging to Daily Sun’s Digital Bones Sangoma Nzama Maluleke to lure clients under false pretences. But Nzama said he saw this coming. “I had a vision last week of people collecting money in a basket, which had my picture in it. I immediately knew something was wrong and went to my indumba to pray. I asked my ancestors to reveal more to me because my vision was clear people were collecting money using my name,” said Nzama from Meadowlands, Soweto. The truth was then revealed to him three days later when several of his clients sent him messages they got from a man named Adams Sheikh. “I was not shocked. They asked me if I had moved from Soweto to Sandton and if I worked with Adams Sheik. I said that I didn’t even know him. “Several of them shared the messages from the scam artists, who used my picture from Daily Sun. The scammers are promising people the impossible. They clearly want to crook innocent South Africans.” He said he didn’t know the man and didn’t like what he was doing. Nzama said it was heartbreaking that the crook used his photo, but he would pray against them. “My ancestors don’t like what they did. They will sort them out. They must know I see what they’re doing.” On Saturday, 3 July Nzama opened a case of fraud at the Sandton cop shop against the man. When Daily Sun contacted Adams, he said he would contact Nzama. “Yes, I got the picture from the internet but I was not aware it will be a problem. Please send me Nzama’s number and I will sort it out with him,” Adams said.
