THE ANC notes and respects the decision by former President Jacob Zuma to comply with the incarceration order issued by the Constitutional Court. In a statement, ANC spokesman Pule Mabe said the party has always reaffirmed its clear commitment to and defence of the Constitution. “Without doubt, this is a difficult period in the movement, and we call upon our members to remain calm. Former president Jacob Zuma’s decision to abide by the incarceration order was truly a brave and hard decision to make. We wish him well,” said Mabe. Meanwhile, the IFP said it reiterates its call to former president Zuma to respect the ruling of the Constitutional Court, the rule of law, and to allow justice to take its course. “The IFP further reiterates its call for calm and restraint in respect of groups of persons supporting former president Zuma that may wish to hold gatherings, as well as compliance with all Covid-19 regulations,” the IFP said. The DA’s John Steenhuisen said: “Jacob Zuma’s incarceration is an important victory for the rule of law and sends a message to all those who have aligned themselves with the Zuma faction and who have become emboldened by his dismissive attitude, that the law cannot be mocked and challenged with impunity.”
