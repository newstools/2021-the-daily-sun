One must love Mzanzi. Despite the country having seen looting mayhem the past few days, there were bizarre and hilarious images and videos of looters that took the internet by storm. The most classic one was the man with a vibrator followed by the one with a mannequin. Our struggles are not the same. I thought someone looting a coffin was weird but then it hit me. We bury our loved ones every weekend and coffins are expensive. https://t.co/JXkDgSfjBW  The big questions here are who will buy? How much? and What do you plan to do with it? An elder Gogo, on crutches with 6 beers got many in stitches. Gogo is thirsty hle #ShutdownSA #ShutDownGauteng #looting https://t.co/YFEyyJDhUW  Coffin looting was way beyond bizarre, but shocking to many who wondered what the looters intended to do with the coffin. I wonder what's a motive by looting coffins https://t.co/h7HdyJzDK7  Karma was what some social media users described in a video in which a looter got takkies with different colours. The lavish and expensive couch worth R68900 which could not get into the mkhukhu was hilarious also.
