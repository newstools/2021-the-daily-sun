SINGER LeAnne Dlamini has tested positive for the coronavirus. The wife of the popular music executive, Sipho Dlamini, took to social media to share the news. She said ever since she tested positive, it has been a complete nightmare as almost all her family members tested positive too. “I tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, followed by positive results for Sipho, Zani and Nosizi on Wednesday. The only negative results were of Zaya and Thato. I tried so hard to keep the virus away from our family. I just don’t know how it happened.” ALSO READ | FOUR TIMES ZODWA WABANTU HAS LEFT MZANSI SHOCKED She further shared news of their progress. “We are managing our symptoms as best we can and we are all doing okay. Trying to isolate and still take care of Zaya and Thato I think has been our biggest struggle. It’s almost impossible isolating from children when all the adults have Covid.” She added that the virus is evil. “We also have so many family members and friends who have contracted Covid-19 this week. It’s been very taxing emotionally and physically but God has been our strength,” she said. She ended her post by thanking everyone who has shown them support in this difficult period of their lives. “Thank you so much to all our family and friends who have been checking up on us daily and dropping off essentials. Please keep us in your prayers, each day is very scary as you don’t know what symptoms you are going to wake up with,” she said. A post shared by LEANNE KISTAN-DLAMINI (@iamleanned)
