Former Orlando Pirates captain Lucky Lekgwathi was not spared the wrath of the anarchy that engulfed the country on Monday. His three months old fast food business, GROOTMAN, based in Kliptown, Pimville in Soweto, was ransacked and destroyed by looters. According to the celebrated Bafana Bafana star, he has lost over R700 000 in damages as thugs looted all his business belongings. "They vandalised everything they came across. They took everything - stock, machinery, cables, computers, just everything," said a distraught and disappointed Lekgwathi. "I don't know where to start now in rebuilding my business. This was my only means of sustaining my life and make a living for my family. "They say soccer players waste money and retire poor. I thought I've learnt and wanted to be different and start something. This too was helping the people of Soweto in my eatery where I employed people. Now it's just gone, gone, just like that." He said he will approach the Gauteng government for a relief in his quest to try and recover from the criminality that was paraded as a protest for the release of former President Jacob Zuma. His entrepreneurship tendencies started with a clothing label "Fantastic 14" which he had previously launched and expanded to eatery. SEE GALLERY HERE:
