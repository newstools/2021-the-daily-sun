THE family of a woman who was allegedly stabbed to death by her husband wants justice. This after the 46-year-old woman’s body was found by neighbours in the couple’s bedroom in KwaMakhutha, south of Durban on Thursday, 1 July. Neighbours were alerted to the incident by the woman’s 10-year-old relative, who was greeted by blood stains on the veranda when he returned from a tuck shop where he was allegedly sent by the husband. The woman’s aunt said the deceased told them her marriage had turned sour. “She told me everything that was going on, including an incident that happened about a week ago, when the suspect threw a pot full of cold water at her, pretending it was hot. She realised that her life was in danger. She stayed in her house during the day, but slept at a neighbour’s house at night,” said the aunt. She said the woman got a protection order and was also in the process of getting a divorce. She said on the day of the incident, the husband allegedly sent the relative to buy bread. “He then turned the radio volume high and allegedly stabbed the victim until she died. He then got into his car and left. He met the relative on his way and told him he was rushing somewhere and would be back soon. The relative found blood stains on the veranda when he got home,” said the aunt. She said the relative tried to open the door, but it was locked. He went to a neighbour’s house to check if the victim was there. “When they told him she was not there, he told them he saw blood on the veranda and they rushed to the house where they made the gruesome discovery. We urge the police to arrest him quickly.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a murder case was opened at KwaMakhutha cop shop after a woman was stabbed to death.
