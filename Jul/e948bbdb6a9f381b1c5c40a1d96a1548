KAIZER Chiefs duo Reeve Frosler and Nkosingiphile Ngcobo have put their disappointment of losing the Caf Champions League trophy behind them to focus on helping the Under-23 national team do well in the Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. The two players arrived in Japan today joining their teammates ahead of their opening match against the host country on Thursday at 1pm, SA time. They were part of Amakhosi side that lost 3-0 to Egyptian giants Al Ahly in the final of Champions League in Morocco over the weekend. Although the players have yet to get settled in Japan following a long trip from Morocco, they are ready to help Mzansi make an impact if selected by coach David Notoane. Frosler will add the much needed stability in defence while also adding numbers in attack. Ngcobo will strengthen Notoane’s attack with his silky skills and trickery with a knack for goals. Said Frosler: “We have had a very long trip and are still a bit disappointed at the weekend results (defeat to Ahly). However, as professionals we are now settled in Tokyo and will be 100 percent ready to play if we are selected in the opening match.”
