THEY took an oath to not only protect and serve, but to also uphold the law. And with looters emptying malls and shopping centres, residents relied on cops to act against this kind of criminality. But instead of stopping looters in Soweto on Monday, 12 July, two constables, aged 44 and 54, joined in on the looting, making off with goods that were estimated at R90 000. These men in blue are now behind bars.  Daily Sun understands that members of the national crime intelligence unit received a tip-off. They followed up on it, and it led them straight to Protea Glen. Members of Soweto K9 went to a house in Doornkop, where they were shocked to find the two police officers in full uniform. The two had even used a marked police van to load and offload the stolen goods while on duty. Items found included in their possession were electric appliances, clothes, groceries, a generator and music systems.  Daily Sun understand that the house belonged to one of the constables. Upon searching the house, the goods, which were stolen during the looting of shopping malls around Soweto, were found in two back-rooms. All the stolen goods were confiscated by cops and taken to the Protea Glen Police Station.  At the time of going to print, police did not get back to Daily Sun, but promised to issue a statement.
