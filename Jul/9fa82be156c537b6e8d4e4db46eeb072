THE DA wants answers after more than 1 million rounds of ammunition was allegedly looted at the Mobeni industrial area in KwaZulu-Natal. This comes after a news report by Netwerk24, which alleged that the looting took place on Wednesday evening, 14 July and that sources claimed the ammunition, imported from Brazil, would have ordinarily been shipped to Cape Town. The DA’s shadow minister of police Andrew Whitfield said there are allegations that someone in the police delayed permitting the truck, which carried the container, to transport the ammunition to Gauteng.

The looters would have required an extensive amount of support to carry out this act,” Whitfield said in a statement. He said these allegations come after a news report by Mail & Guardian on Friday, 16 July, which reported that the violent riots were simply the first stage of a larger concerted strategy to destabilise the country. “The SAPS have confirmed the incident as well as arrests linked to the theft. A case has been opened and a team has been assembled to trace the missing ammunition,” said Whitfield.
