THE dating game has changed a lot in the past three years. While it is cool to hit on each other face-to-face, the introduction of online dating platforms has fuelled a huge social change in the dating world. The sad outbreak of Covid-19 meant that we had to drastically change our social behaviour including the way we date. According to The Kochava Collective, the host of the largest independent mobile data marketplace, there has been a huge uptake on online dating since 2019. To date, over 7,5 billion people globally have an active account on at least one dating platform. According to the Good-House-Keeping publication, these are the best online dating platforms which people should try: 1. Tinder If you’ve been online at all, you probably know of Tinder. According to the Kochava Collective, the app has the highest number of users of all dating apps out there. While a lot of users turn to Tinder for casual meet-ups, others have found long-term love here. 2. Bumble On Bumble, women are the ones who get to initiate communication. Of course, which gender makes the first move is less of an issue for LGBTQ+ women, but ladies seeking dudes may find it as a breath of fresh air, says Kochava. Most of its users also fall in the 26 to 35-year-old age range, so younger daters may like that too. 3. OkCupid Anyone who’s been in the dating game for a while has probably heard of OkCupid, which has been around since 2004. The app with its signature questionnaires about everything from religion to peanut butter vs jelly can help you find your perfect partner.
