FOR former Black Leopards striker Mwape Musonda, it is all about securing his future! The 30-year-old Zambian striker is currently in Mzansi training with his former club, Lidoda Duvha, after his contract with the Arabian Gulf League club, Hatta came to an end. He joined Hatta at the end of the 2019-20 season. But his stint was not a fruitful one as he made only 12 appearances and scored one goal. Musonda, who is in search of a club, said it is all about money. “The financial aspect is one of the main priorities right now, we play for money that is what all we want,” he said. “There’s life after football. You need to make sure that you are secured and don’t come back and have to ask for a cold drink from people. “It’s shameful. To avoid that, I think you need to make sure that you go for the money. It does not matter where you’re playing, as long as you get the money.” One of the main reasons he came back to Mzansi after his deal with the UAE club came to an end was his family. He stated: “My wife is from here. I came to see my wife, while I am open to listening to offers if anyone is interested in signing me. But If I do not get any worthy offers, I will go back to overseas to secure my future.” In his short stint overseas, Musonda does not consider himself as someone who failed. “I think I struggled a bit,” he admitted. “But by the time I had adjusted and started to get my form, the team was already under pressure. We were bottom of the log, and they brought in another coach. “I had to leave because the new coach came with his own players. I then went to Saudi Arabia on loan (where he played in the second division for Al-Sahel FC) and the mandate was to save them from relegation, and we managed to do that. “I would not say I failed there because I achieved what I was asked to do, which was to save the team from being relegated.”
