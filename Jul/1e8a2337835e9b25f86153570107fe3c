MZANSI has been hit hard by violent protests, with criminals torching and looting malls. The protests and looting have led to government to send the army to various parts of the country. In a statement, director of defence corporate communication, Brigadier-General Mafi Mgobozi said: “The South African National Defence Force has commenced with pre-deployment processes and procedures in line with a request for assistance received from the national joint operational and intelligence structure to assist law enforcement agencies deployed in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces to quell the unrest. The deployment will commence as soon as all processes are in place.”  Mgobozi said that the duration and number of soldiers would be determined based on the assessment of the situation on the ground by relevant law enforcement agencies.  “It must be emphasised that the SANDF’s deployment objective is to provide safety and a safe working environment for members of the SAPS and other agencies while they carry out their constitutionally mandated law and order duties. Deployment-related information updates will follow in due course.”
