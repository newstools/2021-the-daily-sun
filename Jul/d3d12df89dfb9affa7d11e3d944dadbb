Stellenbosch FC have confirmed the permanent transfer of Argentine playmaker Junior Mendieta after he spent the 2020-21 season on loan from Club Atlético Lanús in his homeland. The 28-year-old made 23 appearances for the Winelands club in the campaign and they had made it a priority to bring him on board on a permanent basis. “After a season-long loan to the club, we're delighted to announce that we've procured the services of Junior Mendieta as a Stellenbosch FC player,” a statement read. Stellenbosch will hope his creative artistry can bring them better fortunes in front of goal in the new campaign. Stellies scored just one goal in their final 10 games of the last DStv Premiership season, which was a penalty netted by Mendieta. -SuperSport
