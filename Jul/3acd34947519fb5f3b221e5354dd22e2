The manner in which police responded to the crowd gathered in Nkandla over the weekend says a lot about how poorly our cops are trained. They don’t know how to deal with a crowd which was even defying lockdown regulations. Last week police issued a warning saying anyone found organising or being part of gatherings would be fined, jailed or both. Not even one person who had gathered in Nkandla to show support to former president Jacob Zuma was bust. Police Minister Bheki Cele said those who were there will be arrested. Our cops have failed, period. - Sam Difoe Magana - Dennilton, Limpopo
