WHEN President Cyril Ramaphosa announced yet another alcohol ban on Sunday, 27 June, many were caught off guard. At the beginning of the second week of the ban, many people started looking for ways to quench their thirst. Four thugs resorted to breaking into a liquor store in Waterloo, north of Durban, on Monday, 5 July. Reaction Unit of South Africa (Rusa) spokesman Prem Balram said the four made off with a large amount of alcohol. “We received reports of the break-in at about 11.30pm. Officers were dispatched and on arrival, found the front door smashed. CCTV footage confirmed the stolen goods were loaded onto a double-cab bakkie,” he said. Balram said when the guards arrived, the thieves were already gone. They found a trolley loaded with booze outside the store, which was suspected to have been left by the thugs when they realised the officers were near. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a case of burglary was opened at the Verulam Police Station. “The complainant said when he left his workplace at 8pm, all the windows and doors were locked and the alarm set,” she said. “Later on, he received a call stating that the premises had been broken into. “A large amount of alcohol had been stolen while some was left outside the shop in a trolley.” Mbele said the matter was being investigated by police.
