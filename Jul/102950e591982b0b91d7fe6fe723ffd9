THE depleted quasi-Bafana Bafana team currently doing battle in the COSAFA Cup has been strengthened. The side has been boosted by the addition of two members of the technical staff as well as three more players. Morena Ramoreboli has held the fort without much assistance so far and has had to do so with a limited squad. But the arrival of Vela Khumalo, who will be his assistant, as well as goalkeeper coach Thembalethu Moses, will be welcomed by the mentor. Ramoreboli, who only had three outfield players on the substitutes bench, will have more options in the next match. This after the arrival of Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Lebohang Maboe, Bloemfontein Celtic striker Victor Lestoalo and Baroka defender Vusi Sibiya. Bafana are currently at the top of Group A with six points from their two matches. They have beat Botswana and Eswatini 1-0 in both of their outings. They next face Lesotho at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday hoping to seal a spot in the knockout stages of the competition.
