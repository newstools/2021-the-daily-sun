We need to spread the message that vaccines are effective. South Africa needs more vaccines now to overcome the brutal Covid-19 third wave. Mzansi is facing record-breaking numbers as the third wave ravages the country. We are not winning this battle against the virus, so it does not matter where vaccines come from. The Delta variant is a monster, ready to take peopleâ€™s lives. All we need is rapid access to vaccines. In some parts, hospital admissions are rising and beds have run out. A slow vaccination roll-out has left millions of people vulnerable to being infected. We should all be concerned about the rapid spread of the virus. If we can vaccinate many people, we can win the battle against the coronavirus. Theresa Mews
