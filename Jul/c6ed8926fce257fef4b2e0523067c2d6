AT LEAST 24 people were left injured on Sunday, 18 July, after a taxi and three other vehicles collided on the R57, outside Heilbron in the Free State. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said their paramedics arrived on the scene at 2.40pm to find one vehicle in the road, while a taxi and two other cars were on the side of the road. “Several people were found trapped inside the vehicles, while numerous others were found walking around on the scene.
