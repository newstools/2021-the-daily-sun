A COUPLE’S fight in a car led into a BMW ramming into a Ferrari GTC4Lusso, Porsche 918 and a Mercedes. The Ferrari GTC4Lusso that costs R4,3 million and a Porsche 918 Spyder were damaged in China after being hit by a BMW 3-Series in an underground parking lot. Carscoops reports that the incident happened on 4 July when a wife and a husband got into an argument while driving around in a parking lot. The wife is said to have taken out her anger by ramming into the side of the GTC4Lusso, pushing it against a white Porsche 918 Spyder that costs R12 million, which itself was knocked into a Mercedes-Benz E-Class.  The publication says before hitting the Ferrari, the driver of the 3-Series also rammed into a number of other vehicles and pillars, damaging the rear-end of the BMW. Images from the scene show that the driver’s side door and rear quarter panel of the GTC4Lusso have been badly dented after the collision and one of the Ferrari’s wheels looks to have also sustained some damage.
