FORMER Prasa board chairman Popo Molefe says claims that he was investigated for irregular payments were false. On Thursday 15 July, he told the Zondo Commission it was true that more than R1 million was paid into his personal account by Prasa, but he returned the money on his own. The allegation was first made by former deputy finance minister Sfiso Buthelezi in an affidavit submitted to the commission. He claimed Molefe was forced to pay back R680 000 after being investigated by the special investigating unit. Molefe said he was not in the country when board directors were paid this money. “When I found out the minister had not approved it, I voluntarily made a decision to say I was paying back the money until such a time that the process of approval had been effected by the minister. “I encouraged other directors to pay back the money,” he said. Molefe said the reason he only paid back R680 000 was because the rest of the money was taken by Sars. He also responded to Buthelezi’s claim that he irregularly paid Black Hawks bodyguards R6 million of Prasa’s money. “They were not appointed by me. “They were appointed by the company as my life was under threat and we could not rely on the security Prasa employed at the time,” he said. Molefe once again said 1 064 locomotives procured for R54 billion were not fit for purpose. He said they were too tall and too close to the electricity running over them, which was a safety risk. Molefe said in February 2015, the board made a decision to cancel tenders, including modernisation projects, and reissue a requests for proposals. He said the board arrived at the decision on the advice of auditors.
