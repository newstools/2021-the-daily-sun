Dear MizzB I’M a 25-year-old guy who’s in a relationship with a lady of the same age. I’m really struggling to connect with her emotionally and sexually. I have to think about my ex-girlfriend to get an erection and have sex with her. Is this normal? Dear Brada Finding your partner attractive and interesting are the key elements that help to sustain a relationship. Comparing your current girlfriend to your ex is a recipe for disaster. Identify what you like about her and build up from there. It’s normal for a connection to be absent with certain people and that means you are not mutually relating to each other. Should that fail, you need to consider letting her go so you both can find other partners whom you will effortlessly connect with. All the best!
