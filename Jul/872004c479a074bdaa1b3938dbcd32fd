FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns striker, Eleazar Rodgers, is still fit enough to play for another two years in the Premier Soccer League (PSL). This was revealed to SunSport by the 36-year-old veteran’s manager, Rui Alves. The Kuils River-born player has been playing in the PSL since he joined Cape Town-based outfit and former Premiership champions Santos 16 years ago at the age of 21. Since then, Rodgers, who won five caps with Bafana Bafana, has played for Free State Stars, defunct Platinum Stars, Bidvest Wits, Ajax Cape Town and Cape Umoya United who have sold their GladAfrica Championship status to Venda Football Academy (VFC). “We have three offers for him (Rodgers) from three teams in the PSL,” said Alves. “It’s just that now I cannot reveal the names of the clubs as we are busy looking at the best option for him. All I can say is that they are teams from Cape Town and Gauteng. We hope to finalise everything in the coming days. “But one thing I can assure you is that Rodgers still has two more years of playing football. Rodgers has been in the game for years and the secret for that is that he looks after himself and he does not smoke or drink.” Last season, Rodgers played at Umoya but his contract expired. Rodgers was among the nine players VFC waited to renew their contract, but he decided against heading to Venda. Meanwhile, former Bafana striker Tokelo Rantie is negotiating with VFC with the hope of joining them to resurrect his fading career. The 30-year-old former English side Bournemouth and Downs star was on the books of DStv Premiership side Marumo Gallants, but Rantie did not see much action due to injury.
