IT seems as though a dark cloud is hanging over the Zuma family in Nkandla north of KZN. Just as they are still digesting the news of former President Jacob Zuma's arrest, brother to the former president tragically died after a long illness. Michael Zuma, a brother of former President Jacob Zuma and a senior member of the Zuma family in Nkandla, has passed away. It's alleged that Michael was not well, and he passed away around 11 am today (Sunday). His passing comes as his brother, Jacob, is helplessly in jail for contempt of court. Jacob's younger brother, Michael, died after a long illness. Michael was old and he had not been well for many years. Michael’s passing also comes as KZN and Gauteng provinces continue to be gripped by violent protest, linked to calls for Zuma to be released from jail. So far, the KZN government says estimates show that the protests have inflicted a loss of R100 million on the province’s economy. The government has called for calm during this period.
