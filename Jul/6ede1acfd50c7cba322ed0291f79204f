CAPE Town City have signed Congolese defender Nathan Idumba Fasika, his former club FC Saint Eloi Lupopo have revealed. The 22-year-old centre-back is a likely straight replacement for Greek defender Giannis Potouridis, who left at the end of the 2020-21 season. "Nathan Idumba Fasika will not prolong his stay despite negotiations on a new contract started by the club management weeks ago," Saint Éloi Lupopo said in a statement. "He is about to discover the South African Championship with the ambition to make history with his future club, Cape Town City. "Football Club Saint Éloi Lupopo is proud to have counted a player and a man in his ranks, who demonstrated under the yellow and blue jersey of talent and ambition that humility and professionalism. "On the other hand, the club is satisfied that it has been able to accompany its progress and participate in its development at the top level." Fasika is a DR Congo international who played for his country at the African Nations Championship finals earlier this year. He was also involved in the 1-0 friendly loss to Tunisia last month. He will be the fourth foreigner on the club’s books after Mozambique defender Edmilson Dove, Nigerian attacking midfielder Abdul Ajagun and Zambian forward Justin Shonga.
