FORMER Black Leopards and Jomo Cosmos goalkeeper King Ndlovu is ready for the challenge from his Marumo Gallants teammate Washington Arubi. The 28-year-old signed a one-year contract with Gallants, who are formerly known as Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) on Tuesday. He "underrated yet talented" goalkeeper now is aiming to wrestle the No. 1 jersey from Washington Arubi, last season's number goalie. The 35-year-old Arubi also renewed his contract with the Limpopo outfit on Monday. Arubi also signed a one-year-contract with Gallants.Arubi was linked with a move away from the Gallants but it seems the club management convinced the Zimbabwean-born to stay for another season. “I am pleased to sign with Gallants and I am looking forward to the new season,” said Ndlovu, the Ga-Rankuwa-born keeper. “I love what I have seen since I started training with Gallants. They are an ambitious team and I am ready to fight to win trophies with them. "I know it is not going to be easy to just be their number one goalie, as they have other keepers. But I am ready to fight for the first position and do well for the team. It is all about fighting for your position in football, and working hard. I love working with top keepers because it gives you challenges and makes you work hard at all times.” Ndlovu last played football for Leopards in April before he asked for his contract to be terminated by the Venda-based side. Arubi helped Gallants survive relegation and lifted the Nedbank Cup last season under coach Dylan Kerr. But now it remains to be seen who Bahlabane ba Ntwa's new coach, Sebastien Migne, will prefer as his number one in the next coming season.
