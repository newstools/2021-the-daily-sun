SuperSportTV revealed in a statement on Wednesday that they
will broadcast the TotalEnergies CAF Champions League final between South
African football giants Kaizer Chiefs and Africa's Club of the Century, Al Ahly
on Saturday at 9pm. The match  will in Casablanca will be broadcast on
Channel 202 in South Africa, channel 205 in Nigeria and on channel 225 on the
rest of the continent, according to paychannel. Having secured the rights, Marc Jury, SuperSport’s chief
executive, was delighted: “Games on the continent don’t get bigger than this
and we are thrilled to showcase Africa’s best in a match of this magnitude. Two
of Africa’s super clubs in a major final will no doubt boost fans in these
challenging times.” Chiefs will be competing in their first Champions League
final against defending nine-time champions Al Ahly. The fixture has been given added piquancy because the
Egyptian team are coached by former Bafana Bafana coach Pitso Mosimane, who has
enjoyed great success since joining them in 2020. Chiefs are also in the unusual position of being in a major
continental final despite their modest eighth place in the DStv Premiership, a
point Mosimane picked up on in a recent interview in Cairo.
