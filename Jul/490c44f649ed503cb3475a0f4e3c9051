DUMPED alcohol bottles are worth gold in the hands of Tseko Monyamane. The 37-year-old from Heilbron, Free State, finds bottles on dumping sites, washes them and decorates them with colourful wool. He said he was inspired to pick bottles because they pose a threat to car tyres and could cut kids’ feet. “I can turn a dirty alcohol bottle into something that puts food on my table,” he told Daily Sun. Tseko, who now lives in Vanderbijlpark in Gauteng, said he used to draw pictures of people. “But many people are doing that and I wanted to do something different. This is all about allowing the mind to be creative,” he said. “I have been selling sets of three bottles and I get many orders in the process.” His work starts with collecting bottles from the dumping sites. Then he washes the bottles until they look new again. “Then I apply glue and start sticking different colours of wool to decorate the bottles.” A set of three bottles sells from R200 and he has been getting a lot of support. “Who would have thought something that has been thrown away could be loved by so many people? I’ve been able to feed my four children since I started doing this in 2018,” he said. “And I’m also doing my share to save the environment.” He said he listens to what his clients need and it takes him three days to perfect the order. “I encourage people to use their God-given talents to make a living. Someone’s trash could be the next person’s meal,” said Tseko. Thabang Leeuw said Tseko has come up with a unique way of decorating bottles and people are loving it. “I bought some sets from him after I saw his work on social media. This man is good. I like that he’s making an honest living,” he said.
