Plumbers will tell you that too much pressure on water pipes can cause them to burst. And this is what happened to a 40-year-old British man. According to The Daily Mail, doctors in the UK have recorded the first known case of a 4-5 breaking vertically during sex. According to the doctors, the man’s 4-5 “buckled against his partner’s perineum”, or the area between the anus and genitals, before a 3cm tear opened at its base. The doctors didn’t say what position he was in, but 4-5 fractures are most commonly triggered by doggy style and the man on top positions, the doctors said. While there are no bones in 4-5s, experts said they usually break when a man’s 4-5 slips out of his partner and is suddenly bent, which can cause painful swelling.

They said all previously recorded 4-5 fractures had been horizontal. In this case, it split up the tunica albuginea, which is the protective layer around the erectile tissue that pumps blood to this area. Doctor’s said no “popping” sound was heard when the break occurred, which happens when fractures are horizontal. Six months after treatment for the injury doctors said the man was still able to achieve erections of the same quality to those prior to the injury. They said there was no long-lasting curving of the 4-5 or palpable scarring. Penis fracture, according to experts, is popular among men in their 40s. The British Association of Urological Surgeons recommend operating on fractured 4-5s within 24 hours to reduce the risk of long-term problems like erectile dysfunction.
