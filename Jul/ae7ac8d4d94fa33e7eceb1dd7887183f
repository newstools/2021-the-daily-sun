Should there be tlof tlof on the first date? That’s the quesiton we’ll try and answer in this week’s episode of our popular podcast Umjolo and Sex. This week, our hosts Gomie Seabi, Mlungisi Mpela and an expert will unpack whether this is cheap and if the 90-day rule still applies in today’s social context. Mlungisi believes there is nothing wrong with sex on the first date. “If both parties want to take that leap of faith, there’s nothing wrong. We need to stop boxing and blocking ourselves from sexual satisfactions because of social norms,” he said. The presenter was hoping that this episode debunked the stigmas attached to people who had sex on the first date. Mlungisi believes we need to do away with the 90-day rule. “That should not be the standard of integrity and innocence. Also, sex is a feeling that cannot be measured or stored away for later usage. “If you feel that both of you are sexually attracted to each other on the first date, then take it all the way.” If one subscribed to the 90-day rule, then live by it. However, let it not be a measure of cheapness,” he said. Co-host Gomie also agreed that there was nothing wrong with sex on the first date. “There’s no right or wrong way to handle this. It depends on your expectations and how you view sex. But this decision requires maturity,” she said. “Many people had sex on the first date and went on to have a successful relationship. So, it’s different strokes for different folks,” said Gomie. UMJLO & SEX can be heard exclusively @ DAILYSUN.CO.ZA
