CLOSE friends of kwaito star Bonginkosi “Zola 7” Dlamini have poured cold water on claims that the iconic musician is in hospital. They further denied that he was in desperate need of financial assistance to cover the medical bills for his chronic illness. The news of his hospitalisation left Mzansi coming after a local publication reported  that his management team had allegedly started a crowd-funding campaign to help cover his mounting medical bills. But close friend and fellow musician Mapaputsi rubbished the claims, telling Daily Sun that the report was fake news. “People are lying. Zola is not collecting any funds. I was recently with him and he is doing well. He’s not in hospital. Yes, it’s no secret that his health is not good. But we all have our own health-related problems, so people need to stop making up stories,” he said.

They are not collecting any funds and he is not in hospital. We were supposed to visit him last Saturday, but unfortunately because of the lockdown regulations, we were not able to do so. We now rely on the phone to check up on him. And when we speak to his family, they say he is in the same condition we left him in and his health has not worsened,” he said. Zola was diagnosed with epilepsy three years ago, and he recently spoke up about his battle with the chronic disease. “Nowadays I have to take medication twice a day just to get by,” he told Macgyver “MacG” Mukwevho on his YouTube channel Podcast and Chill With MacG. Daily Sun reached out to Zola for comment, but he hung up the phone after being questioned.
