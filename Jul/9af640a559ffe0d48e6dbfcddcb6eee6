A BRIDE was left heartbroken after her future husband died at the altar just minutes before they were due to be married. Paul Wynn, from North Ayrshire in Scotland, collapsed at the wedding venue as his family tried desperately to save his life. The critically-ill 57-year-old was about to fulfil his dream of marrying his partner of 21 years, Alison Wynn. According to The Mirror, she was already walking down the aisle at Saltcoats town hall with their son when tragedy struck. Paul had been told by doctors he had cancer eight days before he died and the couple decided to race to tie the knot. Paramedics had broken the terrible news to Paul that the disease was in his pancreas and that it had spread to his liver and lungs. He was given anywhere between six weeks and two months left to live.
