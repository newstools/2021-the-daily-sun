GETTING accepted into university might be easy for some pupils, but many of them are not prepared for life after matric. It’s for this reason Tshepiso Malema (18) started an organisation called Tshepiso Malema Speaks to give matriculants an idea of what to expect after high school. The University of Pretoria first-year student said most students were likely to drop out without proper guidance. “Firstly, you no longer live with your parents and have to learn to take responsibility for your own life. It’s not easy because you meet different influential characters who can either make or break your varsity life,” said Tshepiso. “Some people apply for courses they have no background knowledge of. They don’t do research and later discover it’s not what they wanted. I know many who have already dropped out,” he said. Tshepiso said he realised pupils from kasis and rural areas didn’t have access to information about careers and life after matric. “I’ve taken it upon myself to help look for relevant people who can help guide pupils through this journey. “I visit schools in townships with university graduates, entrepreneurs as well as people in different career fields to share knowledge,” he said. He said judging by what he saw on social media, they thought university was cool. “There’s nothing cool about multiple assignments and tests you have no clue about. “It takes hard work and dedication to achieve good results. It’s nothing like high school,” he said. Tshepiso said he managed to survive because he had mentors and also teamed up with other students and they supported each other. “I hope to reach as many schools as possible with my organisation,” he said.
