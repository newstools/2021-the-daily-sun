A BAD relationship between separated parents can negatively affect their children. A man paid his final child support payment to his ex by dumping 80 000 coins in her garden. But the woman turned his spiteful deed into an act of kindness by scooping them up and donating them to charity. Avery Sanford from Virginia in the USA claimed her father pulled a stunt on her mother, just a few days after she turned 18, saying it had an emotional impact on her. She said he pulled up with a trailer full of coins and dumped them on the grass outside her mum’s house, who had no idea what was happening. When her mum came out and shouted at him, he replied it was her final child support payment before levelling the trailer and driving off. Sharing the story with local news outlet WTVR, Avery said: “I just turned 18. When I was in the middle of class, my dad came by. He had rented a trailer. “He pulled up in front of the house and turned the trailer on so it dumped out all the pennies on the grass. My mum came out and asked: ‘What are you dumping in my yard?’ “She didn’t know who it was until he shouted: ‘It’s your final child support payment’.” According to The Mirror, the mum refused to let the situation get the better of her. Instead, she scooped up the money and donated it to Safe Harbour, a charity that acts as a shelter. A friend of theirs matched the exact amount and other people started making donations in their honour.
