Whether you love them hard or soft boiled, scrambled or sunny side up, many of you peel off the eggshells before eating your cooked egg. While you might find this weird and surprising, there a lot of benefits to keeping your eggshells. According to Health-line and the Taste of Home magazines, these are the reason you shouldn’t throw away your eggshells: 1. Eggshell Powder Is an Effective Calcium Supplement Eggshells consist of calcium carbonate, along with small amounts of protein and other organic compounds. Calcium carbonate is the most common form of calcium in nature, making up seashells, coral reefs and limestone. It is also the cheapest and most widely available form of calcium in supplements.

In 2010, it affected an estimated 54 million older Americans. Old age is one of the strongest risk factors for osteoporosis, but inadequate calcium intake may also contribute to bone loss and osteoporosis over time. If your diet is lacking calcium, taking supplements may help you reach your daily requirements. Eggshell powder is a cheap option. 3. They Fertilise the Garden Improve the garden with help from your breakfast. Rinse and remove the clear inner membrane of eggshells. Store dry eggshells in a large, secure container. Then you can load up on eggshells again. Once the spring temperatures soften the soil, you can sprinkle and mix the ground eggshells you’ve been saving into your garden for a great source of calcium carbonate for the soil.
