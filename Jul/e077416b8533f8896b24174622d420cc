IF youâ€™re a Ford Mustang enthusiast, this will be a painful video to watch as yet another Mustang crash has been caught on camera. In the video that has surfaced on social media, the driver of a Mustang is seen getting way too confident with his ability to spin the car for spectators. Based on the trail of smoke, it looks like the burnout started before an intersection where a stop sign is visible.  As the driver builds speed, the tail of the car quickly kicks out. Unable to control it, the car veers off the road, slides through some grass and slams head-first into an electricity pole. In the video published by Jeremy Cook, the driver can be seen throwing his hands up in misery instantly after the crash.
