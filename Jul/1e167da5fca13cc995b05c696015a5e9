IT ALL started with protests over the release of former president Jacob Zuma, and it spiralled out of control. Shops were looted, leaving the economy hanging by the thread. But cultural experts say part of the reason for things to have turned out this way, was because the ANC had turned its back on the ancestors. They now wanted the party to repent and ask for forgiveness. Cultural expert Mtimande Ngwenya said the governing party had sidelined the religious sector. “It only thinks of the religious sector when it wants votes. They go to the church and even phahla, but once they win, they forget about them,” said Ngwenya. He said the biggest mistake the ANC made when it took power was to remove religion at schools and in government. “The ANC must go back to the basics. Ask for forgiveness. Don’t rely on your own understanding,” he said. He said that should the ANC go back to the basics and ask for guidance from supreme powers, then that would stop the unrest in the country. “Supreme powers are angry. The late sanosi Credo Mutwa once told the ANC that the ancestor were angry, and the party never took him seriously.” Ngwenya said the unrest showed that the ancestors were angry. Pastor Peter Masemola from a church in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni asked how the ANC could run the country without asking for guidance from God. “When we talk religion, it seems we are boring them. Nothing will come right until they invite God in whatever they do,” said Masemola. So far, more than 70 people reportedly died during the looting, which has been happening since the weekend. More than 200 malls and warehouses were looted, with damages estimated to more than R1 billion.
