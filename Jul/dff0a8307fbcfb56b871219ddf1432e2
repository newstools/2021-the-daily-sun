FOLLOWING a spate of robberies, gatvol residents took the law into their own hands. The people of Xawela block 23, outside Giyani in Limpopo, set up a patrol team to deal with thugs. However, things became ugly on Tuesday 6 July after they caught a suspect and assaulted him before setting him alight. The mob allegedly became violent after he refused to point out his partners in crime. The police said the identity of the man, aged between 20 and 30, is not known yet but a case of murder was opened. Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the police were called to the scene but when they arrived, they found the man had already been killed and burnt. “The victim was apparently accused of stealing a TV from Shikhumba, a neighbouring village,” he said. Limpopo police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe, condemned the incident and urged residents with information of the mob to come forward. She also pleaded with residents not to take the law into their own hands. A resident told Daily Sun cops were not doing enough to deal with crime in the area. “The police treat cases of stolen TVs as minor, forgetting that people worked hard for their possessions. “Our community got fed up,” said the man. Another resident said he supported the residents’ actions. “No one will try and steal what people worked hard for in the future. These thugs are torturing us left and right. We are fed up,” he said. Another person was killed in the same area last month after being accused of raping a toddler. Anyone with information that can help locate the family of the victim should contact Warrant Officer TK Manganyi on 082 414 6709 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
