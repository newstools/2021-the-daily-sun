FORMER head of the Joburg Metro Police Department, Chris Ngcobo died on Monday, 12 July. Ngcobo died at the age of 60 due to Covid-19 complications. To salute him, Joburg Metro cops and members of the Emergency Management Services held a parade outside his home in Roodepoort, west of Joburg, on Wednesday, 14 July. Motorcycles and patrol vehicles roamed his street three times with his family witnessing the heart- warming gesture. Ngcobo’s brother, Jerry, said the parade proved his brother was a people’s person and they were happy to see so much love for him. “The parade showed us how much my brother’s former colleagues loved him. We are happy with the gesture because we had thought people forgot about him as he left the force a long time ago. “But he is still in the hearts of people he worked with, especially those he nurtured,” he told Daily Sun. Jerry said the family was still reeling in shock. “We will forever miss and love him.” Joburg Metro police spokesman, Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar, said Ngcobo was the founder and first chief of the department. “Ngcobo developed the JMPD. We’re here to salute him for the tremendous job he did in developing and nurturing some of the officers in the force,” he said. Minnaar said when the department was established in March 2001, Ngcobo started training new members and enrolled them in communities before leaving the department. “Ngcobo established a number of specialised units which were very functional under his watch. Ngcobo was a focused and passionate man.” Ngcobo will be buried in North West at the weekend.
