FORMER SA Under-23 coach Owen Da Gama believes the current Team SA football squad heading to the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan is better than what he had at the 2016 Rio Games. The SA-U-23 side will be making their third appearance at the Olympic tournament after appearances in Sydney in 2000 and Rio 2016. In 2016 under Da Gama, the SA youngsters were knocked out in the group stages after finishing bottom of Group A with just two points from a draw against Brazil and Iraq. However, heading to this year’s games, Da Gama believes they can get out of Group A consisting of the host nation Japan, Mexico, and France. South Africa will play their first match against hosts Japan on 22 July Da Gama told the players not to be intimidated by the big event and wished them all the best for the tournament. He said: “Coach David Notoane has selected a fantastic squad, and I think we can go all the way. I’m very proud of the boys. I believe in them, and I believe in the coach. “I have been there, which is why I believe we can go all the way. Yes, we are in a tough group and will open against the hosts Japan, but they have what it takes. The players must just not be overwhelmed by the occasion. They must just show big match temperament and show the world they can play.” Despite the lack of friendly matches due to the Covid-19 pandemic to prepare for the Games, the SA team is expected to do much better than the class of 2000 and 2016. The class of 2000 are the only side who managed to win a match at the Olympics when they beat Brazil 3-1, but that was not enough to send them to the knockout stages. Da Gama added: “This is a quality team unlike us (group of 2016) where we had some players in the squad who were not playing regularly for their clubs. We were forced to put a team together. “Now we have a team that 99% of players are playing regularly at the highest level.” The Under-23 are wrapping up their final preparations and are expected to depart to Japan later this week.
