Former president Jacob Zuma is about to taste how the judicial authority system in South Africa works. His non-compliance to adhere to the state capture inquiry for testimony will definitely send a strong message to all citizens, even high-profile politicians. Although the former president will have to hand himself over within five days, as the Constitutional Court has ruled, many people donâ€™t fully agree with the verdict. But the fact remains that Zuma must serve his 15 months in prison, according to the judgment by the Constitutional Court. Finally, our justice system is getting its bus on track! Chapter ( 8) subsection (2) of our Constitution states: Our courts are independent and subject only to the constitution and the law, which they must apply impartially and without fear, favour or prejudice!
