FIVE cops based in the stock theft unit in Ladybrand, Free State, were bust by the Hawks on Tuesday, 13 July. Their arrest took place during the first phase of a major investigation aimed at stopping corruption and stock theft in the province. Hawks spokesman Captain Christopher Singo said the investigation came in October after farm manager Brendin Horner was murdered in Senekal. Police Minister Bheki Cele then visited the area where farmers said police officials were involved in stock theft. Singo said the suspects aged between 28 and 40, as well as two animal stockbrokers between the ages of 30 and 50 were bust in the early hours of Wednesday 14 July in Bloemfontein and Ladybrand. “A multidisciplinary task team was established to investigate these allegations, which led to the arrest of police officials and animal stock brokers. During the arrest of two stockbrokers, police also discovered two unlicensed firearms.” The suspects are expected to appear in Ladybrand Magistrates Court on Thursday, 15 July, where they will face charges of stock theft, defeating the administration of justice and perjury. The stockbrokers will also face charges of possession of unlicensed firearms. Free State head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Major General Kubandran Moodley has applauded the team for the arrest of the suspects reported to be involved in Free State stock theft.
