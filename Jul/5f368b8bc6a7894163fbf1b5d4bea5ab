CLUBLESS Dylan Kerr says he is ready to listen to offers from other teams. The former Black Leopards and Baroka FC coach’s contract with his former team, Marumo Gallants, expired last month and he is yet to receive a revised offer from Limpopo-based side chairman Abraham Sello. But Bahlabane ba Ntwa, as Gallants are known, are taking longer with the new DStv Premiership season set to start next month. Gallants started their pre-season without a coach on Wednesday. And Gallants have also been linked with Pablo Franco Martin, former Real Madrid assistant coach, and Belgium mentor Patrick de Wilde to be in charge next season. “I am a free agent,” Kerr told SunSport. “I have not had anything from Gallants so far. I will listen to offers if they come. I had a good short time at Gallants and I would love to continue to bring success with them. But I have been in football for a while to understand how things sometimes are done.” He added: “I'm now enjoying the Euro 2020, and the good thing is that my country England has made it to the final. But I hope in the coming few days something will come up. I just want to get back to work, as it is what I love doing.” In his three months with Gallants, the 54-year-old helped Limpopo-based outfit avoid relegation, and won them the Nedbank Cup.And by winning Ke Yona Cup, Gallants have qualified for the Caf Confederation Cup next season. Meanwhile, former Polokwane City goalkeeper Bongani Manavhela is training with Gallants with a hope of winning a contract. They will on Thursday announce the acquisition of Sibusiso Khumo, as well as Matome Kgoetyane. On Wednesday, Gallants were without many of their senior players like Alfred Ndengane, Mogakolodi Ngele, Tokelo Rantie, Washington Arubi, Mishark Maphangule and Thabo Rakhale who have joined their Limpopo rivals and Premiership newcomers Sekhukhune United.
