Three days after breaking the African 100m and national record, Akani Simbine will return to action when he enters the blocks against a powerful line-up at the World Athletics Diamond League meeting in Monaco on Friday night. Simbine, who clocked 9.84 seconds in Hungary on Tuesday, will be among the favourites for the top-flight Diamond League race. He is up against a field which also features American sprinter Trayvon Bromell, the fastest man in the world this year (9.77) and Canadian star Andre de Grasse. Six of the eight men in the 100m start list have run under 10 seconds this season. Also on the programme at the same meeting is Ruswahl Samaai, who will turn out in the men's long jump. After finishing fourth at the previous leg of the series in Stockholm last week, the African champion will hope to reach the podium in Monaco. He faces a line-up which is led by world champion Tajay Gayle of Jamaica and in-form European champion Miltiadis Tentoglou of Greece. “Every competition is different and anything can happen because you are as good as your last performance,” said James Moloi, the President of Athletics South Africa. “So, everything they have been all working towards since their last contests will again be tested tomorrow. “We wish them well and trust that every step they take will reap the desired results they seek. We believe that even though this is part of their build up to the Olympics, they will want to end up on the podium tomorrow.” SCHEDULE OF SA ATHLETES: 8.50pm - long jump, men (Ruswahl Samaai) 9.28pm - 100m, men (Akani Simbine)
