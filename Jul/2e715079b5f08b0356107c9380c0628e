THE last time Kaizer Chiefs had the opportunity of playing in the final of a continental competition (2001 African Cup Winners’ Cup), Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Happy Mashiane were two and three years old, respectively. Amakhosi lifted that trophy – the forerunner of the Caf Confederation Cup – by beating Angolan side Interclube 2-1 on aggregate over two legs. This year, the duo is part of the Chiefs team that made history, reaching their first-ever Caf Champions League final. And with four days to go, the nervy moment has almost arrived for Chiefs as they face reigning champions and nine-time winners Al Ahly of Egypt. The game will take place at Mohamed V Stadium in Morocco on Saturday night (9pm). Ngcobo said he would be out to make full use of the rare opportunity of playing in a continental final as Amakhosi seek to stamp the authority and make their fans happy after a dismal domestic campaign. “I think we have done well as a team to get to the final, and now we have to make sure that we win it,” said Ngcobo.“For my career, this is a massive achievement because there are so many people who wish for this opportunity and now that I’ve got it, I will make sure I use it.”Mashiane stated: “Winning the trophy is something that everyone is hoping to achieve. I feel very lucky to achieve this at an early age, therefore I shall cherish it and be happy that I was able to do it.”Dumsani Zuma said they have to finish their job on Saturday.“Most of the teams we played against on our journey here undermined us and that motivated us,” he said.“We kept on giving our best, even if results were not coming our way.“I’m happy to be in the final. It was not easy. There was a lot of pressure from our (poor) domestic league (campaign) but we knew the team is capable and good enough to achieve.”Chiefs veteran attacker Lebogang Manyama wants to win the Caf Champions League for their chairman, Kaizer Motaung.Chiefs leave for Morocco tomorrow to wind up their preparations.
