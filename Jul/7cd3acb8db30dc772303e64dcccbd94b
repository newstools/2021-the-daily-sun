A BOLT driver says he wants his money from actress Letoya Makhene-Pulumo and her wife, Lebo Keswa. The driver, who didn’t want to be named as he allegedly had been receiving threatening phone calls, claimed the Generations: The Legacy actress owed him R5 000 for transporting her to work, as well as her kids to school for three months. On Sunday, 11 July, a fleet of Bolt cars went to her home in Randfontein, West Rand, to collect the money but the couple was not there. The fuming driver told Daily Sun they initially owed him R12 000, but paid R7 000. “I charged them R4 000 per month and started transporting them in April. At the end of May, they paid R1 000 and said they would give me the rest in the middle of the month. “As the weeks went by, they paid me some of the money, but they still owe R5 000. When I ask for my money, they insult me.” The driver said the situation caused conflict in his family. “What hurts me is that my family doesn’t have food and I’m fighting with my wife because they are angry at me. I promised them money and I don’t have it,” he said.

I didn’t want to but we had to go because this was affecting me badly. “When we arrived, I knocked on the door and there was no one. Even though I didn’t find them, I will still give them some time but at the end of the day, I want my money. “If she doesn’t pay, we will all drive to her workplace where I used to drop her off.” Lebo spoke to the SunTeam on Sunday, and said she would comment on Monday afternoon but didn’t answer calls. She didn’t get back to the SunTeam at the time of going to print.
