IT is quite easy for one to forget that Retshegofaditswe “Ox” Nche is not particularly new to the Springbok setup. With an odd test cap, earned against Wales in Washington in 2018, under his belt, Nche is as good a newbie in the national team. His Springbok journey couldn’t quite take off as then coach Rassie Erasmus built towards the 2019 World Cup with some of the tried and tested warhorses. But the time has arrived for Nche to stake his claim in the green and gold jersey. He will start for the Boks against Georgia in their test match at Loftus tomorrow. “Ever since that Test, I’ve been telling myself that I’ll do whatever it takes to get back to that level,” Nche said in a virtual briefing. “The end goal was to get here and get the chance. As much as I’m trying to be a better player, I also have to reap the rewards and get the chance to represent my country. “It is the biggest achievement. The coaches have standards that the Springboks thrive upon. I’m still getting there, and I’ll do anything and everything to ensure I get to those standards and maintain them. “It’s a great challenge. Every single week a different team will come with a different challenge. The first match is as important as the last match. I’m always willing to give it my best, whether it is Georgia or the British Lions..” Nche garnered nearly 100 caps for the Cheetahs in the Currie Cup, several Super Rugby games and the PRO14. That was before he joined the Sharks. At 25, the front rower might be a newcomer to the Boks, but he is certainly not wet behind the ears. Meanwhile, Boks coach Jacques Nienaber has said the British and Irish Lions tour is not in jeopardy despite the threat of Covid-19. “I do not believe the tour is in jeopardy,” Nienaber said.
