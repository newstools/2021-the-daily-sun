KAIZER Chiefs are aiming at winning the Caf Champions League title within 90 minutes. This was the view of young midfielder Nkosingiphile Ngcobo ahead of the final against Al Ahly which will take place on Saturday night (9pm). Chiefs are heading to the encounter carrying the underdogs tag given the pedigree of defending champions Ahly, and the experience of their coach Pitso Mosimane, already a two-time Champions League winner. "The training (in Casablanca) was very nice, we enjoyed ourselves and we are focused on the main mission now. Preparations have been very good, so we are looking forward to the game," Ngcobo said. "It is a bit hot, but not too bad compared to (what they are used to) in South Africa. The training we had relaxed us, and we have the energy. We are feeling fresh. Everyone is on their toes."I'm ready, my body is ready, although we haven't played a match for some time, but we have prepared very well. We will fight."We just want to play them now, obviously we need to be careful and execute the game-plan very well. We want to finish it in 90 minutes."
