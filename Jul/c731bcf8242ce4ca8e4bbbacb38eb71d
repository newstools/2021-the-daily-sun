A 21-year-old Eastern Cape suspect was arrested on Monday, 5 June, for allegedly stealing copper cables worth R2,5 million. Captain Yolisa Mgolodela said cops from Cala were conducting a routine patrol when they came across a suspicious-looking white Nissan NP 200 bakkie loaded with copper cables. “Allegedly, on seeing the police vehicle, the driver of the bakkie sped off, lost control and crashed into another vehicle. He then fled the scene on foot,” Mgolodela said. She said the Hawks were summoned and the suspect resurfaced at the crime scene.

The Hawks’ investigation linked the suspect to the bakkie and the scrapyard where stolen copper cables are often sold. “Sentech, the company responsible for erecting tower poles for network signal around Cala, identified the recovered cables,” Mgolodela said. She said the suspect would be charged and would appear in Cala Magistrates Court soon.
