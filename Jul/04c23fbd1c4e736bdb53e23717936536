FORMER president Jacob Zuma has met his legal team for a debriefing after his application to rescind his prison sentence was heard in the Constitutional Court on Monday, 12 July. The meeting also covered his corruption trial, due to be heard in the Pietermaritzburg High Court from Monday, 19 July. The Jacob Zuma Foundation spokesman, Mzwanele Manyi said: “That’s where we are. We are in court. Right now today, the legal team is visiting president Zuma to debrief him.” Manyi distanced Zuma and the foundation from the unrest and looting in Gauteng and KZN. “Our battle as the foundation is waged within the legal precinct of this country. We are in courts. That’s where we’re fighting our battles. “What is happening on the ground is not in any shape or form part of the programme of the foundation,” he said. “We don’t even know some of the people organising these things. We’re saying the sentence meted out to president Zuma is unconstitutional, as pronounced by other judges. Detention without trial belongs in the apartheid era, not in our democracy.” Manyi said it was becoming clear that there were forces that had taken advantage of the situation. He said the nation should wait for the investigation by intelligence authorities promised by State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo. Manyi said lawyers argued that Zuma should have been kept out of jail while the justice system dealt with the matters. He said different ministers, including Police Minister Bheki Cele, had suggested something bigger was behind the unrest. “We have had State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo saying they have all kinds of information about what is happening. We must wait for the report.”
