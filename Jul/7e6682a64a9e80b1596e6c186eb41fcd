ENTERTAINERS have joined forces to help the people of Eswatini. Musicians, actors, radio personalities, comedians and TV presenters from Mpumalanga have been collecting donations to help that country’s citizens after protests and looting led to food shortages. Their campaign, called 1 Voice 4 Eswatini, was started by musician Afrotraction. Campaign ambassadors are Rise FM presenter Kedebone Mkhabela and DJ Zoe Matsebula. Project manager Ayanda Dlamini said although the campaign only started on Saturday, 3 July, it had already collected 12 000 boxes of food. Afrotraction told Daily Sun: “Mpumalanga is closely connected to Eswatini and these horrible things hit home. “A lot of South Africans have family and friends in Eswatini, so we couldn’t be quiet.” The artist said he knew entertainers would bring in large donations. “They have a lot of influence. We want to alleviate poverty, loss of income and food shortages in the country,” he said.

We had to do something.” Ayanda said they were proud of what they had achieved. “As soon as we heard what was happening, we started the organisation and quickly registered it so we could help. We challenge other entertainers to join us to make this bigger.” However, she said they were struggling to send the food parcels to Eswatini. “We plan to drive to the border and see if we can work something out. We hope to send everything by the end of the week.”
