SWALLOWS who lost a number of key players in the off-season are hard at work rebuilding their squad ahead of the upcoming season. The club have signed former Stellenbosch FC winger Dillon Solomons from Cape Town All Stars. “We can confirm that former Cape Town All Stars footballer Solomons will join Swallows FC,” Solomons' GN Sports Agency of Grant Nieuwenhuys said in a message. “We are extremely happy for him and his family on this move to Swallows FC, specifically due to him taking a step back to the GladAfrica Championship last season and now he's back in the DStv Premiership, where we feel he belongs. “Dillon is a pure example that at times, one needs to take a step back in order to gain three or four steps forward. “We also want to thank Cape Town All Stars management for playing their part in making this move possible. We wish Dillon all the best for the future.” Solomons, who previously played for Royal Eagles, joins Swallows as one of the new fresh faces alongside Thandani Ntshumayelo and Khethukuthula Ndlovu from Uthongathi FC, Mthokozisi Shwabule and Siphelele Ndlovu have returned to the Dube Birds after they were sent on loan last season at Solomons’ former club Cape Town All Stars Swallows, who were the only club who did not lose a league match at home last season after they were promoted to the top flight at the beginning of last season, lost Sifiso Hlanti, Kgaogelo Sekgota, Njabulo Ngcobo to Kaizer Chiefs. Rising star midfielder Given Thibedi and Sizwe Twala have also gone back to Amakhosi as spending a loan stint at the Birds. Swallows also parted ways with Bantu Mzwakali and Phetso Maphanga, while Sammy Seabi has returned to Mamelodi Sundowns after the end of his loan deal. Brandon Truter’s side, who provided a breath of fresh air last term, will open their 2021-22 season away to Orlando Pirates next month in the MTN8 quarterfinals.
