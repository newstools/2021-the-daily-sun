NORTHERN Cape will have a side in the GladAfrica Championship for the first time in 17 years after Hungry Lions won the ABC Motsepe League play-offs final at the Mbombela Stadium, Mpumalanga on Saturday. With this victory, they collected a whopping R1 million in prize money. The Postmasburg-based Hungry Lions edged North West outfit Platinum City Rovers 5-4 on penalties after a hard fought final that ended 2-2 in regulation time to be crowned ABC Motsepe champions. Rovers were also promoted as runners up and went home R500 000 richer. The last Northern Cape team to play in the First Division was Basotho Tigers in 2004. Player of the Tournament Bongi Mkhwanazi (24) thanked the former Kaizer Chiefs star Gert van Schalkwyk, who is the coach of another ABC Motsepe League team Real Hearts FC from Stilfontein near Klerksdorp where Mkhwanazi played previously. “My former coach Schalkwyk managed to arrange for me to play for Hungry Lions. I’m here today because of Schalkwyk and also thanks to my present team,” he said. The centre back, who hails from Khuma in Stilfontein, wants to follow in the footsteps of his late illustrious cousins Phil and Bennett Masinga, who were both PSL and Bafana Bafana stars. He was surprised when he heard he was honoured after the tournament: “After hearing my name announced as the Player of the Tournament, I then believe that God is great as I’m always praying to see myself becoming successful and that anything is possible. “I’m so excited. I know that my success will motivate young players back home. These play-offs were tough.” SA Football Association president Danny Jordan praised Northern Cape and Safa Siyanda Region president, Emma Hendricks, for bringing first division football to their province.
