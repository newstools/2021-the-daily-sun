MASKANDI star Senzo Zondi, who is affectionately known as Ntencane, is allegedly in a papgeld battle with two of his baby mamas. Ntencane allegedly warned his two baby mamas last week to stop tarnishing his name in public or he will take them to court. This all started when the two mothers claimed on social media that Ntencane is failing to serve his duties as a father. Sources said that Ntencane could lose a lot as a singer if the two mothers continue with their claims. “Ntancane has five childrem with different mothers. I’m not sure if he maintains the other kids. But it’s clear that he doesn’t maintain these two women’s kids. That is why they embarrassed him on social media,” said the source. Another source said the mothers are lying low after Ntencane warned them.

But it’s ok. Let me not speak further,” she said. The other mother said that Ntencane must man up and play his duties as a father. “Taking us to court won’t feed his kids. Ntencane must man up, and think of his kids,” she said. Ntencane said it’s hard for him as an artist since there are no gigs because of the pandemic. “But I maintain my kids. I have five kids. I think my two baby mamas are trying to drag my name through the mud because I’m no longer with them,” he said. He said he had to warn them because their claims could make him lose a lot.
