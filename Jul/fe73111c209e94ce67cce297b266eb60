The Health Department in Mzansi has refuted claims that sex can cure the coronavirus. The warning comes after a fake document surfaced on social media claiming that having sex for four to six hours a day can cure Covid-19. The bogus letter with bad grammar and typos reads: “The only way we can beat this Coronavirus! Note let’s keep everyone indoors at least four to six hours a day we confirm that sex is the only medication we can use for now. Let’s try to make many rounds as we can at least four to five per day until further notice. This is for elders only a health and strong. Together we conquer.” Heartlines CEO Dr Garth Japhet recently asked the public to pause before they share fake news about the virus, as that has the power to break the progress already made to fight the pandemic. Dr William F Marshall, from the Mayo Clinic, told The Irish Sun that kissing and engaging in sexual activities can expose one to the virus. “People who have Covid-19 could also spread respiratory droplets onto their skin and personal belongings. “A sexual partner could get the virus by touching these surfaces and then touching his or her mouth, nose or eyes,” he said.
