Swallows FC have completed the signing of former Orlando Pirates midfielder Thandani Ntshumayelo on a one-year contract. The 31-year-old has largely been in the football wilderness since a four-year ban in 2016 for taking recreational drugs halted his promising career. The ban was later reduced to two years on appeal. He has been training with Swallows for some time, having also previously tried his luck at Baroka FC, where he made a fleeting 35-minute appearance in the 2019-20 season. Ntshumayelo started his career at SuperSport United, helping them to the league title in the 2009-10 season in his breakthrough campaign. He joined Pirates in 2011-12 and won the league again with The Buccaneers in his first season, later becoming a regular before off-field issues saw him fall out of favour. He also played for Pirates in all five games as they lifted the 2014 Nedbank Cup. -SuperSport
