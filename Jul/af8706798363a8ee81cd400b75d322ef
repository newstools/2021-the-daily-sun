TEN years without tlof tlof! A self-confessed sex addict woman has made a shocking revelation as she fears relapsing again. The 39-year-old woman from Atlanta in the USA said despite being sober of sex for more than 10 years, it was too risky for her to be friends with men again. According to The Irish Sun, the woman used to flirt with a lot of men so that she can have sex. The publication reported that the former sex addict realised that she needed help when she started dating two men. “I had two boyfriends for two years. I got caught three times. I was such a good liar I got out of it. I was totally gaslighting them. I would overlap every relationship; I would always have someone in line,” she told the publication. The woman said she loved having multiple partners and moulded them to satisfy her needs. She has now published a novel based on her experience called Secret Life of a Hollywood Love and Sex Addict. The book details how addiction began and solely blames it on movies that she watched while still a teenager. She hails her therapy sessions for helping her get over her sex addiction but admits that she might relapse. “I can’t have guy friends, I can’t even talk to waiters. “I would flirt with anyone. I would even flirt with the door,” she added.
