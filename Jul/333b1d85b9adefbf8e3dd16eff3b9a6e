IN a video that’s gone viral, a woman from Kentucky in the US shared a strange story behind her name. The woman named Kristina said there was a deal before she was born that if it was a boy, her mother would name the child after her father, but if it was a girl, her dad would pick the name. When she arrived, her dad selected a name and filled out the necessary paperwork. According to The Mirror, it turns out her dad had been having an affair and he shamefully decided to name the baby after his nyatsi. The dad reportedly did this so that if he slipped up and accidentally said the nyatsi’s name, everyone would think he was talking about his daughter.  I just hope I make my namesake proud ?? #storytime #story #name #cheater #stitch #prouddad #daddysgirl #GossipGirlHere #fyp? #foryou #viral #trending
