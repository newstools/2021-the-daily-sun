SA UNDER-23 team have landed safe in Tokyo, Japan for the 2020 Olympic games. The squad left Mzansi via Ethiopia on Tuesday, and they landed in Asia on Wednesday. The Under-23's will be based at a Modern Olympic Village for the tournament scheduled to kick off next week. Coach David Notoane left Mzansi with a squad of only 17 players. This was after the withdraw of five Keletso Makgalwa, Fagrie Lakay, Lyle Foster, Sipho Mbule and Abbubaker Mobara due to different medical complications. Kaizer Chiefs duo, Reeve Froslerand Nkosingiphile Ngcobo are expected to join the Olympic team from Morocco after Kaizer Chiefs Caf Champions League final, which will take place this Saturday. On their arrival in Japan, Notoane said the players in the team understand the importance of doing well in these games not just for the team but also for their careers. "We have waited so long for these Games to take place and it is an honour for us all to be here. The players understand that this is a prestigious event that will definitely take their careers to the next level, as playing in the Olympics is a career highlight for every player," said Notoane. "We are currently jet-lagged and resting but the boys will be fine. We will in the next few days take it easy and have light training sessions before focusing fully on our opening match against hosts Japan." The team will have almost a week to adjust and prepare for their first Olympic games, where they will face the hosts' Japan next Thursday (22 July) at Tokyo Stadium time 20h00 (1pm, SAÂ  time). They will then play France at Saitama Stadium on 25 July 2021 at 17h00 (10am, SA time) before their last group A match against Mexico on 28 July 2021 at Sapporo Dome time 20h30 (1pm, SA time).
