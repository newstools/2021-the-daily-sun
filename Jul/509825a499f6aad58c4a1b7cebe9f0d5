THREE people lost their lives when a fire raged through Plastic View squatter camp in the east of Tshwane in the early hours of Sunday morning, 18 July. About 400 shacks were burnt down and 25 people were taken to hospital with mild to serious injuries. Some of the victims have been taken to the nearby NG Church. Resident Knowledgeable Moyo (20) said it was rumoured that the fire was started by a drunk man who was cooking. He said the man fell asleep and his paraffin stove exploded.  “When residents realised there was a fire, it was too late for some. I was asleep when the fire started,” he said. Knowledgeable said he and his girlfriend escaped with just the clothes on their backs. “My neighbour kicked open my door and screamed that we should get out immediately. We both grabbed jerseys and ran out. The shack was quickly engulfed in fire. The fire was spreading fast and we had to kick other doors so others could also escape,” he said. Community leader Benjamin Sithole said they were praying the injured would survive. “Some were badly injured. It was hard because there are no roads here and emergency services couldn’t reach us,” he said. Benjamin said they had to take the injured to a local sports ground. “It was heartbreaking. It was cold and there were no blankets. Women and kids were crying,” he said. Lovemore Naka (36) was so devastated he couldn’t speak. He bought a car two weeks ago and it burnt out. Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman Charles Mabaso said: “Unfortunately, three people lost their lives and 25 others were transported to hospital in ambulances.” The SunTeam could not locate the man who allegedly started the fire. Residents said he could have been among the injured or he might have fled in fear.
