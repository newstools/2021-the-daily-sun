FORMER president Jacob Zuma has lost his bid to stay his
arrest as the Pietermaritzburg High Court his application. The judgment delivered in seconds by Judge Bhekisisa Mnguni
further ordered Zuma to pay the costs. This means that Zuma will stay behind bars for the weekend
pending his application to the Constitutional Court to have his 15 months
sentence rescinded. He is currently serving time at the Estcourt Correctional
Center where he handed himself over on Wednesday night. The former president will now hope the apex court can rule
in his favour failing which he would have to serve his sentence for a period
within which he can apply for parole. His imprisonment has sparked a wave of protests in KZN with
footage of protests circulating of his supporters blocking roads and burning
tyres demanding that he be released or the province will remain shut down.
