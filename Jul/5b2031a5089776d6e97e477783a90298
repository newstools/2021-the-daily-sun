LIFE Esidimeni warned top officials of disastrous consequences. This is what former managing director Dr Morgan Mkhatshwa told North Gauteng High Court on Tuesday, 20 July, during a virtual hearing into the Life Esidimeni inquest. He said former health MEC Qedani Mahlangu, former head of department Dr Barney Selebano and former head of the mental health directorate Dr Makgabo Manamela were key players in the Marathon Projects. Those were where mentally-ill patients were moved from Life Esidimeni facilities to a number of NGOs. This resulted in the deaths of 144 patients between 2016 and 2017. The NGOs were found inadequate to cater for mental healthcare users while others were unlicensed. Mkhatshwa said Gauteng Health stated that it was terminating its contract with Life Esidimeni due to cost of services, which was already low. Mkhatshwa said the department’s plan was not clear. He said normal procedures when moving patients were not followed. “The project had to happen within a short period of time. We never vetted these NGOs. We also offered for them to learn from our facilities what they could be up against.” Mkhatshwa said he was assured by Manamela and Selebano that patients would be in good hands. “The report given to me is that they would make sure the facilities were in the same standard.” He said clinicians handed over patients to department officials, and what happened thereafter they did not know. Sadag’s Cassey Chambers had testified they were not allowed to see patients, as they were not family, and loss of lives could have been avoided.
