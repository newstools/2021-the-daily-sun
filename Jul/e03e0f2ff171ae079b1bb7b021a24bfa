AS former president Jacob Zuma is languishing behind bars, South African celebrities including musician Nhlanhla Nciza, actress Gugu Gumede and rapper Big Zulu have sent messages of support to Msholozi and his family. They have expressed their dissatisfaction with his arrest on their social media page. Gugu posted a picture of herself with Zuma and wrote: “Nxamalala, our family will always appreciate the emotional support you gave us during and after my mum’s ailment. Those visits and check-ups went a long way. When many turned their backs on us, you did not. This will forever be a testament of your character. Yima njalo Msholozi.” Meanwhile, gospel artist, Andile KaMajola commented: “We will not only remember t he noise of our enemies but we shall not forget the silence of our friends. #Sekudlulilekonke sohlabelela. Qina Msholozi,” wrote Andile KaMajola. Big Zulu said: “It’s painful.” Manaka Ranaka posted Zuma’s photos and captioned them with a broken heart. But not everyone agreed with those who sympathise with Zuma.

Is it a norm that people will undermine the rule of law and not be disciplined because they fought for freedom and that they are old. Wake up South Africa, are we not equal before the law. Do you want a lawless society? Wrongdoers are arrested every day and we are quite, is it because only the poor deserve to be arrested. I am disappointed by those people we thought are our role models. We are in this mess not because apartheid, but because of the inability to distinguish between right and wrong. Maybe some of you have benefitted hence you are angry.” Zuma was sentenced to 15 months in jail by the Constitutional Court for contempt of court. On Wednesday night he handed himself over to the police to start serving his term at Estcourt Correctional Centre. A post shared by Big Zulu (@bigzulu_sa)
