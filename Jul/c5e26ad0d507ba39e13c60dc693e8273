MZANSI is
facing a possible fuel shortage and government has also thrown a spanner in the
works. It is now
officially illegal for motorists to buy petrol in containers. The Mineral
Resources Department announced the new regulation bans the retail sales of
petroleum products to the public in portable containers. The
regulation was issued in terms of section 2(1) (a) read with section
12C(1)(a)(v)(aa) of the Petroleum Products Act of 1977 and serves to prohibit
retail sales of petroleum products to members of the public in portable
containers. In a
statement, the department said the Controller of Petroleum Products shall
impose such conditions of licence in respect of a retail licence issued in
terms of the act and the petroleum products sites and retail licence
regulations to ensure the retail licensee complies with the prohibitions in
regulation 3. Meanwhile,
South African Petroleum Refiners, which runs a massive refinery complex in
Durban supplying 35% of South Africaâ€™s refined fuel, has declared force majeure.
According to the AA, that means events beyond its control with the recent
lawlessness have forced it to shut down the refinery. The AA
warned that if an operational refinery were to be overrun by criminals,
surrounding areas would be at great risk.
