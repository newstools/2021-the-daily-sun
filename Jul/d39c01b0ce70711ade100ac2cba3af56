SAFA CEO, Tebogo Motlanthe, has clarified the omission of David Notoane’s name from the Team SA football squad list when it was confirmed by Fifa last week. Fifa confirmed the squad list of players for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan later this month, as well as registered technical team members, with Notoane’s name nowhere to be seen. Kwanele Kopo is listed as head coach, while Wendell Robinson is the goalkeeper coach. However, Motlanthe said there’s nothing untowards with Notoane’s omission but just an administrative gaffe “and it is something that they have noticed and rectified”. “It was a mistake,” said Motlanthe. This gaffe should not raise further frustrations for Notoane, who hasn’t had the best of preparations for the Olympic Games. Just yesterday, a statement from Safa said five more players – Sipho Mbule, Lyle Foster, Abbubaker Mobara, Fagrie Lakay and Keletso Makalwa, who was on standby, have all been released from camp. This was due to unspecified medical reasons. SunSport understands Safa could re-call Chiefs duo – Happy Mashiane and Reeve Frosler – among replacements. The duo was part of the squad, but were dropped due to club commitments. Notoane’s squad selection was also affected by the withdrawal of players earlier – Percy Tau, Gift Links, Thibang Phete, Siphephelo Sithole, Thapelo Morena and Siyabonga Dube. Further disruptions occurred earlier with their trip to Saudi Arabia cancelled due to Covid-19 infection rate, forcing Notoane to opt for a local camp as Plan B in Mpumalanga. They’re billed to face Australia in a final warm-up game on Friday to build up confidence. South Africa, yet to progress beyond the group stages in their past two Olympic participations, will open their account against Japan in Tokyo on 22 July, then meet France three days later in Saitama. They will conclude their Group A against Mexico on 28 July in Saporo. – Additional reporting by Mthokozisi Mkhonza
