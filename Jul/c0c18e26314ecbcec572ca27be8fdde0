Akani Simbine ramped up his Olympic preparation by setting a new African and South African record in the 100m at the Gyulai Istvan Memorial meet in Hungary on Tuesday. Simbine crossed the line in 9.84 seconds, beating the previous SA mark of 9.89, which he set at the same meeting in 2016, and lowered the African record from 9.85 seconds. Simbine thought he had broken the record in April this year at the SA Championships but a 2.8m/s tailwind meant his time of 9.82 seconds was recorded as unofficial. Performances like this will only do the world of good for Simbineâ€™s confidence as he heads off to Tokyo in search of an Olympic medal. * @AkaniSimbine has entered the chat* ??9.84 + an African record for the South African ???? in Szekesfehervar #ContinentalTourGold pic.twitter.com/NmyEeL807U
