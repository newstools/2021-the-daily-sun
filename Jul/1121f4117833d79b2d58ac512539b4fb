AN inmate died inside uMzinto Correctional Services Centre on the KZN South Coast during the afternoon of Monday, 12 July. This comes as he was trying to escape, following the torching of the prison hours earlier. Provincial correctional services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said the prisoner was part of a group that had climbed to the roof to escape. “He fell from the roof and succumbed to his injuries.” Nxumalo said the prisoners trying to escape were awaiting trial. The part of the centre that was burnt housed remand detainees. He said: “We condemn this attempt by jailbirds to undermine the security within the centre. The department is going to take actions against those involved in this torching.”
