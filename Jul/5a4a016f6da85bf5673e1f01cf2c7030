MINISTER Lindiwe Zulu’s apparent background porn picture is fake. This is word from the Department of Social Development, which also condemned the photoshopped pictures of the minister, currently circulating on social media. According to spokeswoman Lumka Oliphant, the department was aware of a manipulated picture of Zulu participating in a virtual national memorial service of the late former Zambian president, Dr Kenneth Kaunda. She said the memorial service which was held on 8 July, with Zulu as the official programme director, was hosted by the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture. “In the original picture, Minister of Sport Nathi Mthethwa appears on the screen of the gadget on which Zulu was connected. “This type of content is created to assassinate the personal and political character of Zulu. “We condemn such malicious actions in the strongest possible terms,” Oliphant said. “Additionally, the minister will not be distracted from her core mandate of serving the vulnerable and poor by this malicious campaign, particularly in the midst of the third wave of Covid-19 that is ravaging the country. “In this era of fake news, the department urges members of the public to be vigilant and verify sources of information that they read before sharing it on social media platforms.”
