Covid-19 vaccines are expected to be redirected to rural areas in the Western
Cape in the coming weeks as the province aims for equitable access to its
vaccination rollout programme. Vaccinations
in rural parts of the province were lagging behind those in the metros, Dr
Keith Cloete, head of the Western Cape health department, said during a digital
briefing on Thursday. To reduce the inequality, the department will redirect
its vaccine supplies. The
province has vaccinated 338 879 people during the second phase of the
vaccination rollout programme, and expects to receive around 150 000 more doses
in the next three weeks. The focus
on rural areas comes at a time when cases are significantly increasing. Rural
areas recorded a 63% week-on-week increase, compared to 44% in the metro. The
Overstand saw a week-on-week spike of 125% while the Cape Winelands saw an
increase of 59% week on week. The Garden
Route saw a 54% week-on-week increase in cases, Cloete said. He added that
hospitals in Mossel Bay and George were extremely busy. Over the
last few weeks, the province recorded a number of outbreaks in small towns,
including Suurbraak, Buffeljagsrivier, Hawston, Murraysburg and Kliprand. In
Kliprand, the town of around 250 residents was quarantined after 30 cases were
recorded. Health
officials also said Kannaland, Oudtshoorn, Saldanha Bay, Bergrivier, Malmesbury
and Wesbank remained areas of concern. SOURCE: NEWS24
