MULTITALENTED Lesego “Mic-Killer” Ndubane (19) will release his second mixtape Love is Artificial in November. He told SunBuzz: “The mixtape accommodates everyone. “It is inspired by the struggles we face as up-and-coming musicians to get into the industry. “The project is also meant to motivate young artists to stick to their calling. “For me, this is important because sometimes our own families and friends don’t give us support. Instead they see our craft as a hobby and not a career,” he said. The mixtape has 10 songs. He worked with two artists, Low King and Star Gaxey, from his kasi. They are under his record label, Hit Squad Records, which he founded in 2018. Taking us through his musical background, he said: “I was born in the rural areas of Bapong in North West. “When my parents separated in 2012 I moved to West Rand, Gauteng. “I started making music professionally in 2015 under a production group named Proverb Productions.” His close friend gave him the stage name, Mic-Killer. “He must have seen something good in me. I instantly liked the name and it sort of motivated and assured me to pursue music as a career. “When I started my record label, I was also having negotiations to join African Born Frees. “Unfortunately, those negotiations failed. But I wasn’t discouraged because a lot of good things were happening on the side. “For example, I went on to work on West Rand Awards and Proverbs Productions as an artist manager,” he said. Apart from his music career, he has started his own clothing brand. “It’s called Mic-Killer. This is because I want to grow this brand and I want my fans and supporters to easily identify my clothing from the rest,” said Mic-Killer, who’s also a poet. “My dreams are to show my clothing line globally, grow my music brand and motivate up-and-coming artists,” said the young artist.
