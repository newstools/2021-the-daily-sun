NEWLY appointed Sekhukhune United assistant coach Thabo Senong has admitted that it will be a different challenge to work in the DStv Premiership. Senong has never coached at club level in the top flight of Mzansi football in his 17 years as a coach. The 40-year-old has spent most of his career in the national team setup where he led the South African Under-20 team and Lesotho’s senior national team. He spent five years with the SA U-20 team, helping the side win back-to-back Cosafa Cup titles in 2017 and 2018. He also led the side to two World Cup tournaments in a row. Senong will now look to impart his wealth of football knowledge on the Babina Noko team as second in command to head coach McDonald Makhubedu. He replaced former assistant Selaotse “Sly” Mosala, who parted ways with the club last week. The newly-promoted Limpopo side are shaping up ahead of their debut campaign in the top flight next season. They believe Senong, who holds a Safa Level 3, Caf A and Fifa coaching instructor certificates among others, will improve their technical team. And the former Lesotho coach is relishing the opportunity to make his mark in domestic club football. “I am honoured to be part of the Sekhukhune United project. The club suits my values and beliefs as a person,” said Senong. “I’m very excited. I am part of a project that is very ambitious and it suits my core values. There are a lot dedicated and knowledgeable people at this club. “I just want to thank the chairman as well as the entire technical team for trusting me with this role. “I’m looking forward to serving and learning a lot in the process. This will be a different challenge, but I’m looking forward to adding a lot of value.”
