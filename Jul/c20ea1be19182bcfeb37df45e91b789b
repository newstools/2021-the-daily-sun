Musician Ntando Bangani is back with a bang! He’s gearing up for the release of his 9th studio album titled Camagu, which will drop next week. Speaking to Daily Sun, the singer said it took him a year and half to complete this album and its title was a message of gratitude to his ancestors for his blessings. “The title is my way of thanking my ancestors for being there for me throughout my career. “I’m grateful that they kept me safe in this unstable music business for this long,” he said. He said his love of music has kept him in the business despite the challenges he faced along the way.

So this song is a way of giving people who feel they are just floating hope and let them know they are not alone.” He admitted that a lot of things have changed over the years. “My first album was a cassette and now music is sold digitally, and that’s a platform we are still trying to navigate,” the singer said.
