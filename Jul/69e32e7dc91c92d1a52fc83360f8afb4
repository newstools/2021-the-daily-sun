BEING told your contract will not be renewed is not good news for any player. However, former Polokwane City midfielder Mpho Mvelase said he is happy that the GladAfrica Championship side opted against renewing his contract. Mvelase is among the eight players that will not be returning to City in the new season. He confirmed his departure from the club yesterday. He said: “I am happy that I have left Polokwane City.  As much as it came unexpectedly when the chairman told me they will not exercise my two-year option, I am happy.” “Mvelase said he and his agent will be looking for the way forward as he is keen on returning to the DStv Premiership.” Goalkeeper Cyril Chibwe is another player who has left the club on mutual consent. The Zambia international told SunSport that he will now focus on the Cosafa Cup with his national team as they will be trying to defend their title. Chibwe said: “We reached an agreement with the club. At this stage, I am getting ready to link up with the national team for Cosafa. The rest will follow after the tournament. “But it’s just a matter of taking the right offer, there are a couple of clubs interested both in the DStv Premiership and GladAfrica Championship.” Rise and Shine, who were relegated from the top-flight at the end of the 2019-20 campaign, also parted ways with veteran winger Elias Pelembe, Zambian centre forward Charlton Mashumba, centre back Nicholas Motloung, winger Vusimuzi Mngomezulu and central midfielder Mthokozisi Nene. Polokwane finished their first season in First Division in a disappointing 12th position despite their promising start to the campaign.
