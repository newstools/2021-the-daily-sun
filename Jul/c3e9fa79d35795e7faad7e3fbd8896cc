A TAXI war has erupted in Ceres, Western Cape, with commuters even getting shot inside taxis. So a group of women started Sizamuxolo Group to bring peace to the industry. This followed a recent shooting of a four-year-old inside a taxi on the way to school. Ward councillor Nonzame Phatsoane said the incident was a wake-up call. “It made us realise that more people are going to lose their lives because of this war. “That child had nothing to do with the war between associations, but he was shot and is still fighting for his life in hospital,” said Phatsoane. She said they wished taxi associations would work together. “We will have a meeting with taxi owners and beg them to stop the fighting, because it does not only affect them, but passengers too.”  According to Phatsoane, over 25 people had lost their lives because of the war. “We just want them to work together and know they can resolve their differences without anyone losing their life.” Chairwoman Nosipho Dwala said they started the group as concerned residents who could not sit back and do nothing. “We’re not sure if what we are doing will work, but it is worth trying. It’s fine if we fail, but we’ve tried,” she said. One resident applauded the women for starting the group, even though he thought it would not make a difference. “The only people who can stop these fights are those involved,” he said.
