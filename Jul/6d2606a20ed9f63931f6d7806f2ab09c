MORE vaccines could soon be added to the list of approved jabs for use in Mzansi. On Thursday, South African Health Products Regulator (SAHPRA) announced that applications for other vaccines, such as Russian Sputnik V and Sinovac, were being processed and the decision on them would be made soon. CEO Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela said during a virtual briefing: “The Sputnik V application is being processed under a rolling review process. This means we are processing their application as we receive data. This vaccine is also being evaluated under Section 21, which enables us to authorise it for emergency use. SAHPRA has held numerous engagements with the representatives of the two applicants for registration. We have exchanged correspondence on several occasions regarding the data required for application.” ALSO READ: FAMILY OF FOUR FOUND DEAD! Semete-Makokotlela said they also received application for Sinopharm. She added that if they received a quality application, it took about 90 days but if not, then it could take more time. “While we are expediting the time frames, we remain stringent on the requirement.” She said as a regulatory body in terms of how long the vaccine became available after approval, they didn’t get involved in matters of logistics and distribution. “We are an independent regulator. All the decisions we make are based on science, and this becomes important as we deal with new disease. There is constantly new scientific data that we need to keep abreast of. Even if we do change our decision, whichever one we take is based on science. It is important that we make science-based decision and don’t get influenced by any pressure.”
