THE DURBAN metro police picketed outside Durban City Hall on Friday, 16 July demanding to meet with eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda. The metro cops wanted him to intervene to remove the illegal community policing forums’ roadblocks in multi-racial areas that makes it hard for them to reach their home after work. Samwu KZN deputy chairman Zama Msane said since the illegal roadblocks, four of their metro cops have been assaulted in these roadblocks. She said when they come to these roadblocks they are forced to produce proof of residential on top of that they are being re-directed to other entries, which wastes petrol. “We don’t have a problem with them protecting their shops and houses but the problem starts when they will stop even cops from going to their houses,” she said. She said this is harassment and they want it to be stopped before things get ugly as people are getting more and more fed up. This will brew racial attacks as whites and Indians are not being asked for proof of residential address because of their colour,” she said. Msane said they want to meet with Kaunda to try and find solutions but he was not at the office. “We will wait for Monday so that we can give him our memorandum,” she said. On Thursday, 15 July the head of the eThekwini Metro Police Department, Steve Middleton, called on CPFs to remove their roadblocks. “As much as you have a right to CPF structures through legislation, you have no right to block public roads. This is illegal,” he said. Middleton said : “Open up your public road barricades immediately. There are legislated procedures you can follow, but you have no right to limit access and egress to any area.”
