KAIZER Chiefs will be playing Caf Champions League final against Egyptian giants Al Ahly next Saturday in Casablanca, Morocco – their first in history. Two men from Sunnyside in Tshwane started an initiative in their quest to rally support behind Amakhosi as they will be representing South Africa next week. Thulani Mene (28) and Tlotlo Masisi (24) started the campaign called Connekkt with Chiefs Fan SA. They said their campaign started on Tuesday in Sunnyside where they walk around the streets of the city carrying placards which are all about supporting Amakhosi. Thulani said the idea came about when Chiefs won the semi-final against Wydad Casablanca 1-0, on aggregate, last month. “We are not ashamed of walking around with placards showing our love and support for Chiefs,” he said. He said some people are appreciative of their campaign and others even stop them to take pictures with them while holding their placards. “The Covid-19 pandemic has robbed us of watching the beautiful game at stadiums. Hopefully, the vaccines will easy that soon,” he added. Thulani said his favourite player is Willard Katsande because he’s a soldier on the field and can die for the team to have better results. He predicted that Chiefs will beat the Egyptian team 2-1 and goal scorers will be Eric Mathoho and Samir Nurkovic. Tlotlo, who believes Chiefs win via penalties, added: “We don’t care what people think about us, as long we are supporting our beloved team.” Gerald Kunene (23) said: “My favourite team is Mamelodi Sundowns but next week I’ll be rallying behind Amakhosi because they will be representing all South Africans.” Caroline Lebese (35) said: “We should all support Amakhosi as they made us proud. There’s no way we can lose after such a bad season in the domestic league.”
