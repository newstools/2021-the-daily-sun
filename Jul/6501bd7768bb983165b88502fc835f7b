Gauteng
Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has reportedly said he won't be stepping aside
despite an investigation into a R430 million tender scandal. Speaking to
eNCA, Lesufi said he would continue to hold his position while waiting for a
report from the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) on the R430 million tender for
sanitising schools. Lesufi
previously told News24 he was "dismayed" by reports that more than
R430 million was spent in just three months. The Gauteng
Government Expenditure Disclosure Report, compiled by the infrastructure
management directorate in the department, revealed that R431 274 959.17 was
spent on sanitising schools between June and August 2020 was. The report
stated that prices for suppliers were based on the estimated square metres of
the facility or school. Service providers invoiced the government on the basis
of the affected square metres. The DA has
since asked the public to come forward with information on Lesufi's alleged
tender interference after City Press reported that Lesufi had been heard in a
recording of a meeting where his department's tenders were discussed with his
team. In the
recording, he was heard saying that in the awarding of tenders "our people
should be satisfiedâ€¦ and looked after", and when tenders are advertised
there should be communication about it among those people. Lesufi has
reportedly vowed to act decisively once the SIU investigation is complete. "I am
one person that adheres to the law. The law is quite clear on my mandate and
the issues that need it. I've never been directly involved in that transaction,
nor my friends or people I am connected with politically or otherwise so it
will really be irrational," he told eNCA. "The
issue is, yes, it happened within the department, and as soon as I get that
report I think everyone expects me to act and I will act and act decisively as
I've indicated." SOURCE:
