MARITZBURG United chairman Farook Kadodia and AmaZulu president Sandile Zungu are picking up the pieces and counting their losses following the recent looting and vandalising in KwaZulu-Natal Pietermaritzburg businessman Kadodia’s Hammarsdale business was burnt down. Kadodia has been left devastated by the looting which gripped KZN and Gauteng recently. Speaking to SunSport the Maritzburg chairman said: “My wholesale business in Hammarsdale was burnt down. For 25 years we traded with the community of Mpumalanga. It was devastating after the kind of relationship we have had with the people. We always supported the community if there were problems with funerals or if there was poverty, and helped an old age home. “We were not prepared for this and it is the first time in our lives we have encountered this brutal kind of violence. Insurance on its own won’t support us because we only have normal trading insurances and this kind of damage is so high. It is unprecedented. “For us, if the people and the stakeholders and government feel that we have given a contribution to the economy, then we need their support. “As a country, we need to start the messages of hope and reconciliation. People are bleeding and torn.” This comes at a bad time for Kadodia. He has been forced to deny the continuous reports that his club is up for sale, although he’s looking for a sponsor. Usuthu president Zungu, who runs the Zunguness Wedding and Conference Venue outside Pinetown, said he has been also badly affected as weddings for which he caters had to be postponed. “My businesses have suffered,” admitted Zungu. “The Zunguness, which we call the home of weddings, already suffered hugely due to Covid now (more) weddings at the same time are being postponed. “That means I’m taking losses because at the weekends where there are no weddings, But I’m pleased to say that no one has been fired by me or lost their jobs.”
