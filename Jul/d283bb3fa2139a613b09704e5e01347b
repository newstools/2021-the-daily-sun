AMIDST the chaos and destruction we saw unfolding as thousands took to the streets in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng to destroy property and loot, unlikely heroes emerged. We were hopeless after witnessing days of despicable thuggery and greed as looters invaded shopping malls and engaged in acts of criminality, stealing food and goods. Economists estimated that 50 000 jobs would be lost as a result and the rampage would cost the economy billions of rands. The slow response by government to stop looters saw taxi unions taking to the streets in several areas of Gauteng and Eastern Cape to provide leadership and security to residents. The South African National Taxi Council directed their various associations to form community structures to secure the malls. While looting in Soweto intensified early last week, we only saw a few incidents in Tshwane and other parts of Gauteng. Taxi drivers, notorious for bad relationships with communities due to their bullying tactics and taxi wars, obeyed the laws and were counted with the good guys. Community forums followed, but it was ordinary citizens who rallied around the malls and shops who inspired us. The stories of these men and women touched our hearts and showed us the other side of Mzansi’s hope and inspiration. Mnqobi Mfundisi started the #iLOveMyCommunity movement, inviting community members to clean up the mess that the looters left. Fellow Sowetan Emelda Masango’s Rebuild South Africa group soon gained massive following on Facebook. These South Africans showed us that any journey to success starts with a single step by a single individual. Thank you to these heroes for showing us the Madiba spirit of peace and unity is alive within us. Thank you for reminding us that we are all the agents of the change we all want to see in our lives. - Editor
