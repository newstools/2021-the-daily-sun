LEADER of the African Christian Democratic Party, Reverend Kenneth Meshoe has slammed President Cyril Ramaphosa for the way he has handled the crisis. Meshoe said despite the president’s announcement that police were going to be hard on looters and that soldiers will help in calming down the situation, looting continued and only a small number of people have been arrested. On Monday, Ramaphosa said on national television that he has authorised the deployment of the SANDF to support the operations of SAPS. Meshoe said what has been happening in KZN and some parts of Gauteng has been heartbreaking. “To see property being destroyed and trucks that are transporting food set alight is totally unacceptable.” He said he was disappointed that Ramaphosa said police and soldiers will be on the streets to help regain order. “What did he mean by nip this thing in the bud? Mr President, you can do better,” he said. “If you are tired, look for retirement. But you need to be strong and bring this criminality to an end.” He said Mzansi needed prayer. “For you to say restaurants can open and have 50 people and not allow the church to have the same number of people to pray for the country is a big mistake,. “If you want order, then the churches must be allowed to pray,” said Meshoe. He appealed to those who have allowed themselves to be used by people who have ulterior motives and those who might have other incomes to think about tomorrow. “What you destroy today will be needed tomorrow,” he said.
