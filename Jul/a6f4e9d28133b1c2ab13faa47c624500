GAUTENG uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans’ Association vows to back up former president Jacob Zuma. According to provincial heads, whoever comes for Zuma will be dealt with accordingly. This message was delivered during the association’s press briefing in support of Zuma at a Small Farms lodge in the Vaal. Addressing the media, provincial spokesman Bafana Mahlabe said the likes of Msholozi and ANC secretary general Ace Magashule were politically targeted because they posed a threat to the 2022 ANC national conference. On Tuesday, 29 June, the Constitutional Court found Zuma guilty of contempt for defying its order to appear for a corruption inquiry. He had until Sunday, 3 July, to hand himself over to Nkandla Police Station and be transported to Westville Correctional Facility in Durban and if he failed to hand himself over, cops have until Wednesday, 7 July to arrest him. “All those presumed as threats by the CR group winning the conference are dealt with. It started with secretary general Ace and now Zuma. They are too afraid of Zuma’s influence in the ANC,” said Mahlabe. “They dare touch Msholozi and we will respond accordingly. We have been nursing the feelings of these members of the ANC NEC of the Stellenbosch-aligned.” Mahlabe said they were dismayed by the judgment. “As the MKMVA in Gauteng, we are strongly opposed to such drastic measures as taken by the apex court. As we celebrate the 60th anniversary of uMkhonto we Sizwe, we reaffirm our posture as in the manifesto of MK, which says ‘there comes a time in any nation to submit or fight’. Submission is not an option for us.”
