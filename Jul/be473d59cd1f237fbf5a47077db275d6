Pitso Mosimane has weighed in on the shock move of Gavin Hunt to Chippa United as their new “manager” on Wednesday. The Al Ahly coach believes Hunt could blossom in North Africa. However, Mosimane, speaking to South African sports journalists on Wednesday,, said the former SuperSport coach did what is good for him. "I believe coach Gavin Hunt can coach in North Africa, no doubt about that. But he opted for Chippa. That is his life," Mosimane said. "A job is a job, as long as you are coaching in football, I agree with Gavin, just coach, just coach football but that's life, that's how it is. For me, he's one of the most successful coaches in South Africa." The former Mamelodi Sundowns coach added: "I have had battles with him on the pitch, and he's been a decent guy. Okay, we've had jabs here and there because if you fight for the league title with me, you know there's going to be mind games a little bit. But he controlled it well and gave a team (Wits) a league title after 100 years." Now it remains to be seen if Hunt will be coming in with his new technical team or he will work with the current coaches at The Chilli Boys. Hunt’s move as Chippa “manager” came as a big shock to many football fanatics. In May, Hunt, who parted ways with Amakhosi, was unveiled by club boss Siviwe Mpengesi as the new Chippa coach. Hunt holds the record of having won four PSL titles - three with SuperSport United and one with now-defunct Bidvest Wits. The trigger-happy Chippa chairman, Siviwe Mpengesi, has created a bad reputation for the club, known for firing coaches like flies. In the past five seasons, he has changed coaches more than 13 times. In the recently ended season, Chippa retained their lucrative PSL status in the relegation play-offs, or so they think.
