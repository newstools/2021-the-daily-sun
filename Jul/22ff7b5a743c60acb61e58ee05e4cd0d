HE WAKES up every morning not only to save people’s lives, but their property as well. According to Mandla Sithole, battling fire is his calling. The 41-year-old firefighter from Eldorado Park, Joburg, told Daily Sun it broke his heart to still see people drinking from the same bottle of beer and sharing cigarettes while Mzansi was battling the third wave of Covid-19. Mandla said he started out as a reservist in 2006 after coming across a car crash where firefighters were on the scene. At the time, he was studying information technology but he dropped out to become a firefighter. “Working long hours and night shifts and having to go out to dark areas with high crime rates has become the norm but I always put my faith in God to protect me as I’m here to save lives,” he said. “It’s so fulfilling to save a life and have that person come back to thank you. This is not a job for me but a calling.” Mandla said when Covid-19 first hit Mzansi in March last year, he was worried about his two kids, aged six and 11, and his gogo. “As a front-line worker, I feared I might infect them. With training, encouragement and counselling provided by my employer, I was able to learn how to deal with the virus and observe safety measures.” Sadly, Mandla lost his uncle and his aunt to the virus. “For the longest time, I blamed myself for their deaths. I felt I wasn’t there to save my own family but I later realised the virus was beyond my control,” he said. “Their deaths taught me to take extra caution and to protect those I love, especially my children and my grandmother.” Mandla said he was vaccinated in March and despite seeing negative things on social media, he knew it was the right thing to do. “I had mild side effects which lasted for two days. I had body aches, a mild headache and a bit of dizziness,” he said. “Since my vaccination, I have been able to execute my duties with more confidence.”
