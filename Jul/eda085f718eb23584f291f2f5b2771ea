THE rule at railway crossings is simple, the train always has right of way no matter what. But there’ll always be someone who thinks they know better, and you don’t want to be anywhere near the train’s path. A driver in Luxembourg found that out the hard way recently. In a video that has gone viral on social media, a driver can be seen getting out of an SUV that looks like a VW stuck between the barriers at a railway crossing and away from danger moments before a commuter train slams into the car. The Luxembourg’s RTL reports that police said the driver was injured in the incident. Also, none of the 34 passengers who were on the train at the time was hurt.
