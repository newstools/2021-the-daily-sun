THE PSL transfer window is in full swing after it was officially opened last Thursday. Most of the 16 DStv Premiership clubs have got the ball rolling by announcing their new signings. This season’s window is back to its usual date from 1 July to 31 August. Last season’s transfer window was officially opened on 2 September and was closed on 17 October and was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2019-20 season was concluded on 12 September after the PSL suspended it in March due to coronavirus. With the 2021-22 season window back to normality, clubs have been active as the new season is set to get underway next month. Here’s a guide of club-by-club updates on the deals that have been concluded so far.
