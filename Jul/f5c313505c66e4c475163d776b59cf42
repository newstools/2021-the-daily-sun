lack of freewill. In the

terrifying moment she accidentally poisoned herself. She wrote
as she showed videos of her and her friend deeply smelling Devil’s Breath: “Me
and my best friend found this beautiful flower and spent the night deeply
inhaling its smell. “When we
arrived at our friend’s birthday, we both suddenly felt so messed up and had to
leave. When I got home and fell asleep. I had the craziest dreams and
experienced sleep paralysis for the first time in my life. “Turns out
the flower is super poisonous, and we accidentally drugged ourselves like
idiots.”
