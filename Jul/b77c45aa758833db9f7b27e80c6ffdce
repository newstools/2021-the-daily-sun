IT is no secret that Kaizer Chiefs defied the odds to reach the Caf Champions League final. Chiefs were barred from signing players for two seasons in December 2019 over Malagasy player Andriamirado Aro Hasina Andrianamimanana. No one ever thought they could go all the way and reach the final of the continental showpiece. However, Amakhosi went all the way amid the ban and Covid-19 to reach the final where they will face Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly. Leonardo Castro has urged his teammates to finish the job they started a few months ago. “It is a huge achievement for the team‚ Kaizer Chiefs‚ and for each and everyone‚ the fans‚ the players and the technical staff because it is for the first time that we come this far in this competition‚,” said the Castro who won the 2016 Champions League with Mamelodi Sundowns. He admitted it was never as an easy journey for them, “It was not easy. We faced many things during the campaign‚ like injuries‚ Covid-19‚ suspensions, and the transfer ban. “We faced all of those things and we came out of it and really‚ I am proud of this team. It is not that easy and all of us we contributed for where the team is right now.” “We have put in all our efforts to get where we are right now, and we want to put the star on the jersey’s emblem. “The most important thing for us is to realise what it means to play Champions League football for the team and for the country and also for the continent.” Amakhosi will be hoping to bring down Ahly, the defending champions, to complete their historic fairytale run by winning the Champions League title.
