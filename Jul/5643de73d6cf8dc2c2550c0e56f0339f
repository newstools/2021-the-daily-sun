FOR almost 11 years, single mum of two Ntombifuthi Monareng has been struggling to get her ID. The 31-year-old from Marite, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun she was unemployed and couldn’t get grants for her kids because they didn’t have birth certificates. Ntombifuthi said officials at Home Affairs in Hazyview told her the system rejected her because her mum Maria Mbowane, who died in 1999, made a false registration. “They said it was impossible for my mum to have given birth to two children in the same year. The person she registered as one of her kids is my cousin,” she said. “I don’t know what to do now. I have two kids, aged four and 13, and neither is getting a social grant. “My dad died in 2016 while still tying to help me out. This is not my fault and I’m struggling.” Ntombifuthi said she had to drop out of school. “Employers wanted to employ me, but they changed their minds when they found out I didn’t have an ID. I can’t open a bank account to save a bit of money for my kids, and I can’t even open clothing accounts,” she said. “I am just a walking dead person. My last hope is Daily Sun.” Home Affairs provincial manager Ndalisa Jele said Ntombifuthi was advised to submit an affidavit at their offices.
