A 25-YEAR-OLD well-known Free State Forex Trader, Lebohang Ernest Maboea, appeared in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrate on today, 19 July, where he faced charges of fraud, theft and money laundering. The accused was running a bogus investment scheme around QwaQwa for many years. It’s alleged that during February 2018 until May 2019, Maboea and the other suspect, who is still at large, were running illegal investment scheme by the name of Black Child Billionaire where the victims invested their money with a promise of getting return ranging from 25% to 100%.  Hawks spokesman Captain Christopher Singo said after a period of months, the victims did not get their money as agreed. As a result, the victims suffered a total loss of about R534 000. “The matter was then reported to the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation in Bethlehem for further investigation, which led to the arrest of Maboea in QwaQwa on Friday, 16 July 2021,” said Singo. The case against Maboea has been postponed to Monday, 26 July for formal bail application.
