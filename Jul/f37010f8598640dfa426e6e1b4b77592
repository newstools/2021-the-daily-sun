ESWATINI coach Dominic Kunene has drawn inspiration from Nelson Mandela’s famous saying; “Sport has the power to unite people in a way that little else does”. This was after Eswatini got off their Cosafa Cup championship on a positive note, despite the current unrest in their country. Eswatini citizens have been up in arms, calling for reforms to the country’s system of monarch rule and demanding their right to elect political leaders. However, that seems to have not affected the performance of their national team, who thumped Lesotho 3-1 in the opening day of the Cosafa Cup in Port Elizabeth. “Sports unite people and so I believe such a win will have an impact in calming down the situation in our country,” Kunene said after their win. “I will start by congratulating our players. They did exceptionally well. We knew Lesotho were not going to be easy. But this win will be a huge morale boost for us going forward in the tournament.” TS Galaxy midfielder Felix Badenhorst, Khethokuhle Mhkonto, Fganelo Mamba were all on the scoresheet for Eswatini, while Black Leopards Tumelo Khutlang scored the only goal for Lesotho. Leslie Notsi, who replaced Thabo Senong, who resigned from the coaching post last week, said they had drawn positives from this match, they will bounce back more vigorously in their next match. Notsi told the Cosafa Media: “I would say it was a good game. We engaged ourselves well. Even after we had the red card the boys did well credit to them. We created opportunities but we were not clinical upfront. We are now going to rest and come back, this is not the end of the world. There are a lot of positives that we took from this match. We need to move forward.”
