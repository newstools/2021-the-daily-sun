CHIPPA UNITED coach Vladislav Heric has thanked chairman Siviwe Mpengesi for giving him another opportunity to guide the team. Heric recently returned to the Chilli Boys for his third stint at the club. Despite being fired twice by the trigger-happy Mpengesi, Heric said the two still have a great relationship. “The chairman has a very good heart. I have been crossed with him several times before because he fired me (twice). He said he does not know why he fired me. But I have no issues with him and I am grateful that he called me once again,” Heric said during a virtual press conference. Heric revealed that he joined the club on a short-term deal. He said: “I have a very short-term agreement with the chairman. We just agreed that I will be here until the right moment that we can talk (about the future). My mandate is to win the cup and save the club. I believe I can achieve that.” The Chilli Boys face Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in the Nedbank final at Free State Stadium on Saturday (6pm). With both Chippa and TTM sitting precariously in the league, Heric said they are expecting a tough encounter. “We can expect a very tough game, just like any final. It’s a 50-50 game. It might not be attractive football because everybody wants to win, and so some doors will be closed. "The teams will not take too much of a risk. You have to go for a result. We must also take that into consideration. We are both fighting to escape relegation. But we will put all our weapons out to try and win the game.”
