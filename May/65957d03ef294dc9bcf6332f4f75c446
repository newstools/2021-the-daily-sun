NODUMO Sotsopo (50) is so desperate to save her 18-year-old son, Aphiwe, that when there’s no one at home to look after him, she ties him up with a chain inside the house. She told Daily Sun that she moved to Philippi in Cape Town in the hope that Aphiwe would stop taking drugs. But he still goes back to meet up with his drug buddies in Khayelitsha. She said: “He once got out of the house without my knowledge. I was woken up by his screaming at the door. He had been stabbed.” Since he dropped out of school in grade 9 in 2018, the mother hadn’t been able to get him help. “I have high blood pressure because of the stress,” she said.  The mother suspected that he used crystal meth, known as tik, because she found something in his pocket that looked like ice. Her neighbour said it was a drug. ALSO READ: SUNSAYS:
CHAINING DRUG ADDICTS FOR SURVIVAL! She said when Aphiwe was high on drugs, he broke windows of houses in the area. “Social workers have asked me to bring him to them, but he becomes violent when I try to do that,” said the worried mum. Resident Lwazi Ntutu (54) said she was worried that the boy would kill his mother. “He smashes everything that he sees around him. “I hope he goes to rehab,” she said. Joshua Chigome, spokesman for the Department of Social Development in the Western Cape, said the mother should try the cops to deal with the boy. “Since the young man is an adult, he cannot be forced by the department to go to rehab. “The mother can either lay a charge with the police or approach the local magistrates court for an order. The court may then approach the department for a compulsory referral,” he said. Realistic, a substance abuse treatment organisation, said it was willing to help the mother and son. She would have to take her son to the facility in Gugulethu, where he’d then be attended to by a social worker.
