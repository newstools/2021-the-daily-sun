Education and healthcare go hand in hand and should be prioritised. Children shouldn’t be deprived of these basic needs. One way of bringing education closer to communities is by way of government investing more in these sectors. The future of a nation is in the hands of its youth, evidently. South African public schools have free primary and secondary education, as well as food schemes. This suggests that schoolkids don’t necessarily starve while at school. Hunger affects learning. That is, one’s concentration span. When one is hungry they’re not able to focus at all. Healthcare and education, which are interchangeable, should be easily accessible even in the rural areas. Most provinces these days have services at community level and people no longer have to walk long distances. The more educated people become, the more communities develop. Education is the key to healthy living. It can also help increase life expectancy and reduce population growth. Some young people, while trying to make a living, are driven into pubercent sexual activity and eventually fall pregnant. Poverty is the number one cause of population growth. Being educated increases chances of getting a better-paying job. The more educated people become, the more they practise healthy living, and they can afford better healthcare and neighbourhoods become safer. When you’re financially stable you become less prone to stress-induced illness. The more educated one is, the better they’re able to cope, even with life-threatening crises. Education improves cognitive thinking. It’s key to life. - Letter by Consolation Mathebula Rolle, Bushbuckridge
