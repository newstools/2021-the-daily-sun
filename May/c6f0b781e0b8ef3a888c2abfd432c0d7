Gavin Hunt will mark his 900th game as a coach on Wednesday when Kaizer Chiefs take on Black Leopards in the DSTV Premiership, extending his record as the longest serving coach in South African professional football. Hunt took charge of his 899th game on Saturday when Chiefs lost 3-0 in Tanzania in the African Champions League debut, but had enough of an aggregate lead over Simba SC to book themselves a place in the semifinal. His record over the last 23 seasons is 382 wins, 257 draws and 260 losses. His clubs have scored 1 296 goals and conceded 928. He has not missed a season since the 1998/99 campaign. Hunt’s career in the top flight began with Seven Stars in 1998 and also worked at Hellenic, Black Leopards (where he was coach of the year in 2002), Moroka Swallows, SuperSport United and Bidvest Wits before joining Chiefs at the start of the season. He has four league titles with SuperSport and Wits and won the cup with Moroka Swallows and SuperSport. He had success in the Telkom Knockout and MTN8 with Wits. Hunt, who turns 57 in July, passed Gordon Igesund’s previous mark of 816 last season while still at Wits. -SuperSport
