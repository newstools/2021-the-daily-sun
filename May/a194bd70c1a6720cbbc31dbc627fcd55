SOME tuckshop owners had to pay money to secure their stock from protesting residents in Mahikeng, Rustenburg in the North West on Tuesday, 25 May. Residents were complaining about the lack of services, corruption and the selling of the buildings that were built during the Bophuthatswana era. Residents said the current government was destroying the legacy that former Bophuthatswana president Lucas Mangope left for them. Last week, Bop Flats, built at the same time, were sold at an auction. Days later, residents heard more properties would be auctioned. Maleho Dikgwele said the town was being destroyed. “Mahikeng is not naturally an attractive town. They are making it worse.” Mohau Moletsane said: “Mahikeng is what it is today because of the buildings that Mangope built.” Asked if it was necessary to break into tuckshops and loot, the residents said that was the only language government understood. A tuckshop owner from Dibate said he was approached by a group of boys who demanded money to secure his stock. “They said I must give the money to them or my stock will be finished like other shops.” Human Settlements MEC Mmoloki Cwaile said government has decided to hold the auctioning processes of its properties to allow relevant processes such as public participation to unfold. North West police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone condemned the protest. He said a 30-year-old male suspect was arrested and is expected to appear soon in the Molopo Magistrates Court in Mmabatho,
