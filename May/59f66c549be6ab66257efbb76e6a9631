THE suspect grabbed the jogging woman and pulled her into the bush to rape her. But she put up a fight. She grabbed his balls until he screamed for mercy. Then she ran back to the road to seek help, and a passing ambulance stopped. Paramedics called the police and the suspect was arrested by Duduza police. This incident happened on Friday, 21 May. Sergeant Harry Manaka said the suspect had attacked and choked a 44-year-old woman from behind, and then dragged her into the long grass in the veld. He then tried to undress her. “The woman managed to fight off the male suspect and overpowered him by grabbing his private parts.” He said the woman ran to the road to stop passing motorists, and an ambulance pulled over.

Manaka said the woman was jogging along Fred Wagner road and dragged opposite the John Dube RDP houses. “We advise people to jog with two or more other runners so they are not taken advantage of by criminal elements.” Manaka said in another incident, a 37-year-old man was arrested for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl, who is his neighbour, on 18 May. The teenager came to the suspect’s house in the evening, and then he sent his son out to buy beers. “He was then left with the girl. That’s when he found the opportunity to drag her into one of the bedrooms and rape her.” Manaka said the man was arrested on Saturday after investigation by the cops. He added that both suspects will appear in the Nigel Magistrates Court this week.
