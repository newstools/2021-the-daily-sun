BAROKA FC have vowed to derail Orlando Pirates in their quest of securing a semi-final spot in the penultimate round of the DStv Diski Challenge Rewired on Sunday. The two sides will lock horns at the Rand Stadium (10am) in a game that could decide which team will secure a top-two berth in Group Two and qualify for the semi-finals of the reserve league cup competition. Baroka captain, Senkoto Bobete, is confident of success ahead of their clash against Bucs, who have not won their last two games. Talking to SunSport, the Baroka midfielder said Pirates would be used as their passage to the next round, as they hope to wrap up their qualification with another three points against Bloemfontein Celtic in the final group match next weekend. Bobette declared: “There’s no way we’re going to lose four matches out of seven.” Bakgaga have lost two games against group leaders Kaizer Chiefs and Limpopo rivals Black Leopards. “It’s a do-or-die match for us,” he said. “Everyone is focused and the fact that this is the first time we are doing so well in the Diski Challenge has boosted our morale. “Six points in the remaining two games is mandatory, as failure to do that will mean we not taking ourselves seriously. “The boys know that we’re not doing this only for the club, but for ourselves. This is the stage where we have to sell ourselves and earn promotion (to the first team) and professional contracts.” Cape Town City head Group One with 10 points from five outings, AmaZulu are second with nine points, Stellenbosch FC, Maritzburg United are third and fourth respectively, with eight points each. In this group, the top four teams are playing each other, with Maritzburg hosting Stellenbosch at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium (9am), while AmaZulu welcome Stellenbosch at King Zwelithini Stadium (10am) Chiefs already have one leg in the semi-finals. They lead Group Two with 12 points.
