DJ Hlo has the world at her feet. She recently played her amapiano hit song Festive for a New York audience. On the same day she had the privilege of being interviewed by New York-based online radio station, Radio Clubhouse. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “I’ve never travelled abroad, so I’m happy to have played for an international community. “I was actually invited by Radio Clubhouse. They’d gotten hold of my hit song Festive and were fascinated by the amapiano sound.” This also gave her an opportunity to promote her new song, Shayingoma.

This had encouraged her to work even harder. “My biggest wish right now is to tour the world and work with international artists,” she said. “There’s a possibility of a collaboration between myself and DJ Dante Hawkins, the host of Radio Clubhouse.” DJ Hlo will also open a beauty spa. “ I’ve been planning to open a beauty spa since last year, but due to Covid-19 I had to wait,” said DJ Hlo. “When the restrictions were eased I decided to pursue my dream. I’m opening this salon so that when times are tough I can have something to fall back on.” She said the spa will be located in the Durban CBD. “I’m currently doing renovations. By end of June it will be fully functioning,” she said.
