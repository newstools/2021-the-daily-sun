THE 39-year-old woman that murder suspect Lucas Phasha (52) claimed was his girlfriend has denied knowing or even having an affair with him. Phasha, whose accused of allegedly brutally killing his four children on 17 February last year, claimed he was at a guest house with his nyatsi the night of the gruesome incident. Semakaleng Mehlape from Lebowakgomo in Limpopo who uses false names on Facebook such as Morwesi Mphahlele was called to testify before the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane on Friday, 21 May. This comes after Phasha had repeatedly mentioned he was with her when he previously testified. Mehlape, a mother of two who’s married to a security guard, told the court she only knew Phasha on Facebook. “I don’t know this man and I have never met nor slept with him. He is just a friend on Facebook. He got my cellphone number on Facebook and he is the one who has been calling me all along. During the calls he will tell me he loves me but I said no to him. I am married. He further promised me he wants to employ me when he opens his guest house soon.” ALSO READ: BULLETS FLY IN CASH-IN-TRANSIT HEIST! But during his cross-examination, defence lawyer Advocate Lawrence Mkhize accused Mehlape of lying. “I take it you are denying you know and have met with Phasha on several occasions simply because your husband is here in court. You don’t want to disappoint your husband. Phasha called you several times on 17 February 2020 and you didn’t answer the phone. He opted to engage with you through Facebook messenger and start making arrangements to meet at the guest house.” Mehlape said she had no reason to lie before the court as she was aware of the consequences. Phasha’s accused of killing his kids Katlego (9), Joyce (7), Tshepo (5) and Adel (3) at Seokodibeng village, Ga-Phasha outside Burgersfort. Its alleged the three older children were hacked with an axe and further hit with nails on the heads while the youngest was bludgeoned with a rock on the head.
