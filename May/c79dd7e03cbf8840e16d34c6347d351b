She wrote: “Hi, Team Bucy. The surgery went well on Tuesday afternoon and I’ll be going home soon. “I won’t be taking any bookings for the next six weeks or more and will keep all posted on when I will be ready for performances. Thanks for all the support and prayers.” According to her husband and manager Thapelo, she’ll only start performing in July. “The nature of her surgery can’t be communicated as we prefer it to be private.
