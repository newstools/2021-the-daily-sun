THE COMPETITION will be tight for the Premier Soccer League coach of the season award with four outstanding coaches Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena, Benni McCarthy ad Mandla Ncikazi vying for the gong. PSL announced the nominees on Wednesday, and unsurprisingly AmaZulu coach McCarthy and Arrows mentor Ncikazi cut. This follows after the two coaches in charge of the KwaZulu-Natal sides lead their respective team into the top four in the league. Furthermore, as things stand, the two coaches are on the verge of a historic moment, qualifying their teams to play Caf Confederation Cup and Champions League next season. McCarthy guided his side to an impressive run of 13 victories in 21 games thus far since taking over from Ayanda Dlamini in December.
