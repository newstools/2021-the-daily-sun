THERE was ululation and tears of joy when residents finally received their title deeds. Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda handed over the title deeds to residents at JL Dube Stadium at Inanda, north of Durban, recently. Gogo Mntwanase Zungu (114) was one of the 15 recipients. Although the gogo, who lives with her six grandchildren aged between 22 and 45, is partially blind, she was happy she could slightly see the title deed. Gogo Mntwanase said having the title deed meant a lot to her and she’d keep it safe as some officials sometimes take residents’ title deeds, saying there’s corruption and residents need to be verified as rightful owners. She said some corrupt officials also steal houses and give them to their friends and those who paid to get the houses illegally. “Many of my peers died without receiving title deeds. Mayor Kaunda has wiped my tears and I’m glad I’ll leave my children a home,” said gogo Mntwanase. Kaunda said as government they needed to fast-track the delivery of title deeds to give people dignity and security. “To mitigate the title deeds backlog, we’ve resolved to set up a special team with the Human Settlements Unit, which will be dedicated to fast-tracking the delivery of title deeds to deserving beneficiaries,” he said. Kaunda also unveiled several service delivery initiatives for all wards in the northern region of the city for the 2021/22 financial year.
