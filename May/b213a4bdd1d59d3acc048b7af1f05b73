SA Under-23s’ planned trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to play a hastily arranged tournament has been called. This is due to Dubai having closed off its borders for visitors due to the Covid-19 pandemic. David Notoane’s boys, who were supposed to leave on Monday, were invited to participate in a tournament in the UAE against Brazil, Korea and Argentina. The tournament was going to take place from 5-11 June. The event was a good welcome for the struggling coach Notoane to get competitive games as these matches were going to give him the great preparations for the rescheduled Tokyo Olympic Games set to take centre stage from 22 July-8 August. However, it will not be the case now. “It is because of Covid-19 issues,” said Safa head of communication Dominic Chimhavi. Notoane had named a 25-member squad last week but it was missing a glut of local stars as PSL clubs refused to release their players due to the PSL 2020-21 program ending on 5 June, the same date the UAE tourney was set to start after the league board decided to postpone the season a week later as it was initially supposed to end this weekend. This is not ideal for Notoane, who also in March was left disappointed as he couldn’t get the desired friendly matches. He then decided to take the squad for a two-week camp in Durban to play two friendly matches against two DStv Premiership sides Maritzburg United and Golden Arrows. However, the former Mamelodi Sundowns cried that it was not enough. With the tournament edging so close, one wonders what type of friendly opposition Notoane will get before the main event.
