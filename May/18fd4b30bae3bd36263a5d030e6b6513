My friend and I tried to make sense of why Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng could take leave when the Constitutional Court has to deliver on one of the most important decisions in our democracy. The court has a serious decision to make after former president Jacob Zuma defied its order to appear before the Zondo Commission. On the other hand, Mogoeng insinuated during the JSC interviews that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan might have tried to capture the judiciary through his friend, Judge Dhaya Pillay. This brought to mind what has been said in the corridors of politics that once you dare challenge Gordhan, who is regarded as a de facto president or prime minister by some among his adversaries, it is the end of you. A public statement has been issued to explain why the Chief Justice has taken leave five months before his retirement. Even if the reason offered is true, it still doesnâ€™t make sense that he could take leave at such a critical time. The country needs his leadership now more than ever before, as we are dealing with yet another precedent-setting case of Msholozi.
