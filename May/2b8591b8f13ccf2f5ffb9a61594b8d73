THE Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders has sent a stern warning to initiation schools. The house, with the support of Contralesa, said there was no way initiation schools could take place in the province this winter. Speaking to Daily Sun on Monday 24 May, provincial chairman Kgoshi Malesela Dikgale said: “Whoever defies our orders will leave us with no choice but to involve the police. “We will never allow bogus traditionalists to kill innocent children. We don’t care whether you are one of us or not, we will make sure you go to jail.” He said he gave the same warning during a recent traditional ceremony in the Malamulele area. “People shouldn’t try to have illegal initiation schools in the province. We have already heard rumours that in the Makopane area outside Polokwane people are taking names of possible initiates and claiming they have received permits from us,” he said. “We are saying there won’t be initiation schools this year. “The reasons are that we don’t have enough time and the second is that our people have not been vaccinated against Covid-19 and a third wave is coming. “Parents must make sure their kids are not taken by these people because they don’t have permits. We have not given out permits this year.” Kgoshi Dikgale said the government and the house were not willing to risk the lives of ordinary people while the country was bracing for a possible third wave. National Contralesa spokesman Zolani Mkiva confirmed that a decision was made to suspend initiation schools in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Gauteng due to the rise in Covid-19 cases. “The Eastern Cape wanted to continue, but it hasn’t been finalised. We are still in talks,” he said.
