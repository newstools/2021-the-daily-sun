KAIZER Chiefs have announced the appointment of Molefi Ntseki ahead of the new season as the Club’s Head of Technical and Youth Development Academy. “We are delighted to have Molefi Ntseki at Kaizer Chiefs,” Chairman Kaizer Motaung said in a statement. Ntseki joins Chiefs on a three-year-deal with a two-year option and he will commence his duties on 1 June. Ntseki will have the responsibility of advising on all technical operations and developing the strategy for the senior team, Chiefs Youth Development Academy and the reserves. He will work with all the members of the senior team and also oversee the Club’s Development Academy and scouting department. “Molefi comes at the right time as we implement changes that we believe are necessary for the Club as we go into the future," Motaung added. "We strongly believe that we have appointed the right person for the position as he is someone who has really worked at all stages of football, from school level, youth structures and all our national teams.” The 51-year-old coach was recently sacked as the South Africa national team coach after failing to qualify for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. He previously worked with current members of the technical team Arthur Zwane and Lee Baxter in the national team. “We want to make progress in the way we run our football technical operations at all levels,” added Amakhosi Chairman. “We also do not want to lose all the good lessons we have learned in as far as our Youth Development Academy is concerned. Kaizer Chiefs has seen good players come through our youth structures and we would like for that to continue.” “Our youth coaches have done a tremendous job over the years and we have seen them identify and promote great talent for Chiefs and the national junior teams. It’s important that we keep the Chiefs DNA intact and uniformity to ensure we hire the right people who will be the custodians of what we are building.”
