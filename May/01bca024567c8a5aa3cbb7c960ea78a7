ACTOR, author and motivational speaker, Sipho Mbele, wants people to stop sliding into his DMs. He told Daily Sun he’s no saint and wants people to stop sending him Facebook inboxes, calling him papa or daddy as that irritates him as he’s not a pastor. He said he drinks alcohol and has cheated on his ex-wife. He now wants those who judge him in his DMs to leave him alone. On his Facebook page, he said he might be a motivational speaker but he doesn’t like to be portrayed as a pastor. He said he wants to live his life as freely as possible.

Me motivating you, if nakhona you are motivated, doesn’t make me daddy or your papa. Ngiyaphuza utshwala ngesikhathi sami. Yes, ngadivorcer because I cheated. Maybe you need to read my books and newspapers. Me talking about Bishop Makamu, I’m not judging him but sharing my perspective. Iphi ifreedom of speech? Digging up my past won’t help you. Qubeka, and let me know what you got. And yes if ngiyacela, probably ngicela my peers. TSEK MAAN. AKUNYIWE ONCE.”  The post was accompanied with a photo of different drinks. His fans supported him, with Jola Bede saying “I like your honesty Bhuti Mbele. People must not act like saints and roles models,” Sisanda Somsam also commented: “Bayakuqhela... Who doesn’t have a past? Does that mean you’re not to express your views or comment on things? Mabahlukane nawe.” Kgatliso Nkosi “You are what we need. I love your honesty, sense of humour, realism, motivation, books and posts,”
