THE bail hearing of an alleged taxi hitman was once again postponed by the KwaMhlanga District Court. The 28-year-old suspect faces two charges of murder and one of attempted murder. The case was postponed as the state prosecutor and suspect’s lawyer had a disagreement about its schedule. The state prosecutor said the suspect faced a schedule six charge as the crime was premeditated. But the suspect’s lawyer disagreed, saying there was no concrete proof that the crime was premeditated. He said the charge should rather be schedule five. The case was then postponed to 8 and 9 June.
