COPS on Friday visited schools in Ekurhuleni after a bullied schoolgirl killed herself recently. Daveyton police and Metro cops addressed about 239 pupils in grade 6 and 7 at Daveyton Intermediate School. Pupils were taught about children’s rights and responsibilities, consequences of engaging in crime, disadvantages of using drugs and alcohol and gender-based violence. Police conducted searches at Davey Secondary and Rivoni Secondary, also in Daveyton, where they searched pupils’ bags. Said Sergeant Constance Moalusi said: “They confiscated two knives, dagga, broken mirrors, a punch ring, cigarettes and a pairs of scissors.” Moalusi said such objects were used to commit violence and bullying. He said police gave out emergency numbers and that the searches would take place on a regular basis.
