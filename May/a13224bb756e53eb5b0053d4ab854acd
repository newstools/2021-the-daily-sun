A man of God like Bishop Israel Makamu is a disgrace to the gospel, if allegations against him are true. It’s alleged that Makamu asked for sex from a younger congregant. This is very shameful. Instead of owning up and apologising, the pastor continues to lie to the nation, saying he wasn’t asking for sex but for keys. Why not tell the truth and apologise? This will show integrity and we’ll respect him for his honesty and eventually forgive him. As a pastor, he knows that all sins can be forgiven. We’ll understand you’re human and that you also make mistakes. Letter by Carlton Dlamini Polokwane
