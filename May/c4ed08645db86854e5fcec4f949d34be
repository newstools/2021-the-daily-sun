BAFANA Bafana star Percy Tau says he is not ready to wear the captain’s armband. This as speculation is rife that newly appointed Bafana coach, Hugo Broos, is considering him for the role to lead his side when they face Uganda in an international friendly next month. The Brighton and Hove Albion striker said this yesterday after being honoured by motor giant company Hyundai with a new i30N to drive during the off-season break. Tau is one of the few experienced players in the squad as Broos seems to have snubbed majority of players over the age of 30, including Thulani Hlatshwayo, who was captain when Molefi Ntseki was still in charge of the national team. Said Tau: “I have never thought about it (armband) before. I prefer the supporting role. Others will wear the armband. But we will see if the coach wants me (to be captain).” However, Tau is aware that he will need to play a crucial role together with Ronwen Williams, Musa Lebusa and Rivaldo Coetzee in guiding youngsters, as Broos has put his trust in youth to qualify for major competitions such as the World Cup with qualifiers, scheduled for September. “I am one of the experienced players with Ronwen and Keagan (Dolly). Before it used to be Andile (Jali), Thulani leading the team, but now it’s different. We need to take responsibility. But young ones like Tebogo Mokoena, Luther Singh, and Sipho Mbule will be challenged to this role, but some of us enjoy being leaders.” Meanwhile, Tau said that he will stay with Brighton next season, ending rumours that he’ll be loaned out as he struggled to cement his place in the starting line-up. “I was happy to have contributed to the team for the few games I played. It has been six months since I arrived there and if they want to loan me out, they will do that based on what? I didn’t play enough. I will continue to fight for my position next season because I always see a future there. I will stay and that’s my position right now,” he said.
