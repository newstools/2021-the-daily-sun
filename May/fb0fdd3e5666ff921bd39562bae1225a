IDOLS SA  season 9 contestant Sne Zungu has used her stunning voice to heal the Zulu nation. She released a single titled Isililo Sesizwe, which aims to comfort all people who loved late king, Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu. The 30-year-old singer from Esikhaleni, KZN, told Daily Sun her song thanks the king for everything he did for Zulus. “For me and many people, it felt like we lost our father when the king died. “He had a big impact on the way Zulu people behave. He was influential and always reminded people to never ignore their culture.” Sne said music is a good tool with which to console people in difficult times. “Music works on many occasions. We sing when we have lost someone and when we’re happy,” she said.

She’s since released five singles and collaborated with stars such as Ringo Madlingozi and Zonke Dikana. She re-recorded Thabath’ Umthwalo because she felt she’d not done justice to it. “I released it again in 2018 when it was produced by Dr Moruti and Mono T. That song is important because it was the first I ever wrote and recorded.” She’s currently working on her debut EP, which will be released soon.
