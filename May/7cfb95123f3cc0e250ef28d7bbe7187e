  ORLANDO Pirates not only crashed out of the Caf
Confederations Cup but were humiliated in the process as they suffered a 4-0 loss
Raja Casablanca in Morocco on Sunday.  Without doubt, the Buccaneers faced a herculean task
overcoming Raja away at Mohammed V Stadium in the heart of the city of Casablanca.  Going 4-0 down inside the opening 37 minutes, Josef Zinnbauer’s
men didn’t give themselves any chances of turning the tie around, having drawn
1-1 in the first leg in Orlando last week.  What came in the second was a mere formality, as Raja barely
broke a sweat to dispatch of Bucs.  First-half Goals from Zakaria Wardi, Soufiane Rahimi and
two from Ben Malango already sealed Bucs fate.  It was one of the worst defeats for Bucs in continental football,
but a scoreline which is hardly shocking to those who have seen them crash to top
sides such as Mamelodi Sundowns.  They spoiled for a fight in the second half, Deon Hotto
and Gabadinho Mhango troubling the Raja rearguard. But it was nothing like the effort they put in in the
first leg at home.  Their defence was penetrated with ease and they weren’t
any better in the midfield either, although they retained their shape in the
second half in which they restricted the Raja from adding more goals.  With the PSL games fast running out, Bucs will have to give
it their all in the remaining four matches to secure a Champions League spot
next season.  They nothing else to play for other than to secure a
top-three finish in the Premiership.
