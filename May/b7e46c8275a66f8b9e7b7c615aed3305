Four police
officers accused of murdering Mthokozisi Ntumba appeared in the Johannesburg
Magistrate's Court on Friday morning. The matter
was postponed for further investigation. The State
requested a postponement to gather all outstanding evidence, including
statements, the ballistics report, the post-mortem report and the footage. Tshephisho
Kekana, 27, Cidraas Motseothatha, 43, Madimetja Legodi, 37, and Victor
Mohammed, 51, were arrested a few days after Ntumba was shot and killed in
March, allegedly by the accused while they were dispersing students who were
protesting non-registration due to historical debt. The accused
are facing a charge of murder, three counts of attempted murder, as well as
defeating the ends of justice. The accused
were granted bail of R8 000 each in March. Their bail conditions include that
they may not intimidate or contact witnesses and not apply for a passport or
travel documents. Although
the State vehemently opposed bail, it was granted after the court heard
submissions from the accused which cited, among other things, that they were
the sole breadwinners of their respective families. News24
earlier reported that Ntumba, a bystander, was shot and killed in Braamfontein
while police dispersed protesting students. Ntumba had
just left a consultation with his doctor. He had medication in one hand when
the police, who were chasing after protesting students, allegedly shot him. The accused
remain out on bail. Gauteng police previously did not provide clarity on
whether the accused have been allowed to return to work. SOURCE: NEWS24
