A COP decided to express his frustration towards
his boss by ramming his bakkie into his boss’ Mercedes-Benz SL. The cop used a Mitsubishi L200 bakkie to drive directly into the white Mercedes SL, which was parked in front
of the police department. The officer then crashed into the parked Mercedes
a few times before getting out of his bakkie holding a hammer, which he used to
wreak even more bodywork damage. According to Carscoops, the Mercedes was pushed
towards the curb from the impact, causing some really expensive suspension
damage. Almost every panel on it was dented and the windows shattered. The furious officer then entered the police
department, broke the door of the captain’s office, and threatened him in front
of his shocked colleagues. The man was eventually arrested and is now
facing charges of destruction of private property, assault and attempt at
serious injury, among others.
