GOVERNMENT officials on Tuesday, 25 May visited survivors of the bus fire which killed six people. Mpumalanga Transport MEC Mohita Latchminarain and Nkangala and Thembisile Hani Municipality councillors, including Sarah Masilela, went to console the victims. The bus they were travelling in caught fire on the notorious Moloto Road on Friday 21 May. Latchminarain said there were four survivors being treated at the George Mukhari, Steve Biko, KwaMhlanga and Montana hospitals. After the visit to the patient at George Mukhari, Latchminarain said it was an emotional experience for her as a mum to see the victims, who were left with severe burns. “The tragic accident could’ve been avoided had all the necessary precautions been taken by Putco.” Latchminarain sent her sincere and heartfelt condolences to all the families affected by the tragedy. She pleaded with the police and everyone else investigating the incident to leave no stone unturned. “Our communities are angry and crying out to us, as the government, to prioritise their lives and put their interests first,” she said. On Sunday 23 May, Gauteng Public Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo visited a patient at Steve Biko Hospital. During his visit, he said: “The provincial government will appoint an independent investigator supported by a team of fire experts who will establish the cause of the fire.” On Thursday 27 May, Latchminarain, Mpumalanga Community Safety MEC Vusi Shongwe and Mamabolo will visit the families of the six people who died in the fire. The Putco bus they were on was travelling from Tshwane to Tweefontein, Mpumalanga.
