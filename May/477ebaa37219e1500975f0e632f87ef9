A martial arts fighter has recalled the horrific moment he was brought to tears after he broke his 4-5 in a painful sex injury. In an episode of Sex Sent Me to the ER, he narrated how he suffered his most severe injury setback while preparing for a tournament in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This didn’t happen while he was in the ring, but during a quick moment of intimacy with his girlfriend. According to the Daily Mail, he got a little bit intimate in the heat of passion and she happened to be on top of him. During the couples against-the-clock lovemaking, the pair found themselves slightly out of sync. This caused a significant and eye-wateringly painful injury to his 4-5. “Unfortunately, as she went a little bit too high, I slipped out, and when she came back down, I was still obviously fully erect. And basically, she bent me over the top,’ the man said. Within a matter of seconds, the couple’s romance had turned into a scene out of a horror movie. “Blood just sprayed all over the place,” he recalled. “I’ve had some significant injuries, but as far as the actual pain, and I was in shock at that point, it was brutal.” The man remembers running into the bathroom to grab a towel to stop the bleeding, only for matters to escalate. “There was so much blood loss that I felt light-headed and then I lost consciousness,” he said. “I ended up cracking the bottom of my jaw on the floor as I fell.” Regaining consciousness, a short time later, he and his shocked girlfriend decided to call an ambulance. “I can’t describe the pain, it was brutal,” he said. “That was an embarrassing moment for me, you know. There you are, with all your manhood less than manly.”
