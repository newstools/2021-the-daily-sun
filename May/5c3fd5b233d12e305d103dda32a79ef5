The corruption case against former President Jacob Zuma is expected to resume in the Pietermaritzburg High Court today. Zuma is facing charges of corruption, fraud, and money laundering that come from the country’s procurement of arms deal, and the former president is alleged to have taken bribes in return for providing political protection to one of the winning bidders, Thales. Zuma allegedly received an annual bribe of R500 000 from the French arms dealer Thales, for political protection from an investigation into the controversial arms deal in the 1990s.

The trial in the matter was set to go ahead today but it’s unclear if that will still be the case. pic.twitter.com/h4rfXiBVNF  The alleged bribe was reportedly facilitated by his former financial adviser Schabir Shaik. Zuma’s defence on the case is unclear as he recently split ways with his lawyer’s advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, Eric Mabuza. This happened last month, three weeks before the start of the fraud, money laundering, and corruption trial.
