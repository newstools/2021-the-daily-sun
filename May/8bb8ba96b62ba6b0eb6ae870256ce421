A DURBAN undertaker is due to appear in court after he allegedly stole a coffin. The 50-year-old man was arrested on Saturday after he was allegedly found in possession of the stolen coffin. According to Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the manager of a funeral service in Ulundi alleged the suspect, a funeral parlour owner, came to her office on Thursday, 13 May. He requested to buy a dome coffin at a discount, a request that was denied. “The following morning on arrival at the office, the complainant discovered the storeroom had been broken into. The dome coffin, green runner and two grave anchor crosses were missing,” said Mbele. Investigations started after a case was registered at Ulundi Police Station. “After intensive investigation, the stolen items were recovered at the suspect’s offices and he was arrested. He’ll appear in court today, 17 May facing possession of suspected stolen property charges,” she said.
