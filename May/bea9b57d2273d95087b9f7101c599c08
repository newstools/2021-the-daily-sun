FORMER Muvhango actress Suzan Ravuku (39) has opened up about being bullied at school. She said the bullying and subsequent suicide of Mbilwi Secondary pupil Lufuno Mavhunga (15) last month opened old wounds she thought she’d healed from. She told Daily Sun when she was in primary and high school, teachers and fellow pupils used to call her blackie while others called her mantsho. “I ended up going to my neighbour and asking for a mirror to see my reflection and I didn’t see anything wrong with me. Sadly I learnt in 2016 that my kids are also being bullied for their skin colour. I got so emotional and realised we are living in a socially-ill society that must be educated because there are people who can’t stand up for themselves.” Suzan said she felt bad she couldn’t speak for Lufuno. “Bullying is a poison that kills someone slowly on the inside,” she said. Suzan has since started campaigning at local schools in Vhembe to teach pupils about appreciating each other and judging others based on their appearances. “I started an organisation called Vhembe Youth Programme where we go out to different communities to speak to traditional leaders and other authorities on behalf of the youth.” Suzan also testified before the Human Rights Commission’s hearing into bullying, corporal punishment and sexual relationship between teachers and pupils, sharing her experience about bully at schools. The hearing started on Tuesday, 18 May, at Bolivia Lodge in Polokwane, Limpopo. It was wrapped up on Thursday, 20 May, where recommendations on how to fix those problems were presented.
