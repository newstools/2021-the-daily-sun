DYLAN Kerr truly performed a miracle saving Baroka from relegation last season.  This time around he is looking to repeat the feat with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and complete what could be remarkable run with the lowly Limpopo side.  A goalless draw against Baroka at Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday ensured TTM move to 11th spot with points while Baroka are in eighth on 33.  Many had already written TTM off as the previous owner, Lawrence Mulaudzi, made a comedy of the PSL team.  But not only have TTM won the cup, but they can also retain their lucrative Premiership status.  They have now picked up 12 points from their last seven matches.  They could secure maximum points against a stubborn Baroka side in the provincial derby.  Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo has been influential for TTM in recent matches, but yesterday could not have a sniff at goal as he found his match.  Even Thabo Rakhale was closely guarded but he managed a shot off the target from close range.  Richard Mbulu has scored some crucial games for Baroka this season and thought he had grabbed a possible winner, only for Oscarine Masuluke to pull a great save in the second half.  TTM are not save yet and they will need to pick at least four points from their final two matches.  On the other hand, Bakgaga need to win their remaining two matches to be guaranteed of a top-eight spot.
