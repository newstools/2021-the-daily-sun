Controversial painter Rasta has been hard at work again and people are divided about his recent painting. Rasta, whose real name is Lebani Sirenje, paid his last respects to Zulu regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu, with a painting. Rasta, who attended Queen Mantfombi’s memorial service held at KwaKhangelamankengane palace in Nongoma, KZN on Friday, 7 May, told Daily Sun he’s proud of the painting he did of the late queen. “When King Zwelithini passed in March, I got many threats from people saying they would beat me if I painted a wrong painting of him. I did a good painting of him and went to KwaKhethomthandayo royal palace to show them and everyone was excited to see my drawing. I nailed.” Rasta said it was important for him to honour the queen in the same manner he did the king. ALSO READ: PRINCE KAYBEE CHALLENGE SETS TONGUES WAGGING! He said he was now waiting to see people’s reactions. “I know other people will say her painting looks like another person. Many people look alike. I don’t have any problem with critics because it shows I’m an artist. People are always divided. While others criticise, others are excited and appreciate my work,” he said. Rasta, who receives backlash whenever he paints artists or politicians who’ve passed on, said his craft keeps getting better every day. “It took me one day to paint Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu. People love my work and I have many fans. “Now if someone has passed on, you will see other people posting bad paintings on social networks and saying Rasta did it again when I have not painted them,” he said. Rasta said he loves his way of drawing as it keeps him relevant. Zama Mncube told Daily Sun Rasta nailed both his painting of the king and queen, while Xolani Ndaba said he got it wrong this time.
