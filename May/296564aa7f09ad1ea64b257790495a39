A CUSTOMER borrowed R1 500 from a mashonisa and promised he’d pay it back on Friday. And as agreed, the customer went to mashonisa’s home at Everest squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni, to pay him. But after leaving the 28-year-old mashonisa’s home, the customer allegedly sent people to go and take the money back from him. While sitting at home with his brothers, the mashonisa heard someone kicking the door open. Two armed men demanded money from him, but he told them he didn’t have. Captain Johannes Ramphora said one suspect shot the mashonisa’s younger brother in the right foot. “They then continued demanding money from him and he still said he didn’t have.” The suspects then shot the mashonisa’s other younger brother in the leg as well.

He said the two suspects, wearing balaclavas, started to attack the mashonisa. They hit him with pistols on the head and injured him. Ramphora said the suspects searched the mashonisa and took R1500 from his pockets and two cellphones that were in the room. The suspects fled the scene on foot. He said all three victims were taken by ambulance to Far East Hospital for treatment. Ramphora said the two suspects are unknown and cops are appealing for help to trace them. Daily Sun spoke to one of the mashonisa’s younger brothers who has since been discharged. He said the suspects pounced on them after 8pm. “They looked like people who came with information and knew what they wanted,” he said. “They went to my brother and demanded money from him and shot us because they wanted him to comply and when he refused, they attacked him,” he said. “I hope he’ll recover and that people who attacked us will be found and arrested.”
