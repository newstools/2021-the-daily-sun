A FATHER is devastated after two of his children died in mysterious fire on Friday, 21 May. Toto Nongwe (55) said he didn’t know when he left for work on Thursday, it would be the last time he’d see his daughters Nolubabalo (26) and Sinovuyo (17) alive. He said he not lost his daughters but all his belongings as well. He’s now pleading with SunReaders to help him bury them. “I don’t know what to say. It still feels like a nightmare. Losing two kids at once is not easy,” he said. Toto said he was at work when he received a call from his neighbour, telling him his shack at Thabo Mbeki squatter camp in Cape Town was burning. “I was shocked and asked what started the fire. It was around 2am when the incident happened,” said Toto. “My eldest daughter wasn’t staying with us but yesterday she came to sleep over. I left her with her younger sister.” He said they didn’t have power the whole day on Thursday. “I think when it came back, our electricity box blasted and the fire started,” said Toto. He’s now left with his mentally-ill son, Sonwabo. Resident, Nomawethu Mpangele said they tried to save his daughters but they were too late. “It was around 2am when we heard other residents shouting. We rushed outside but on our way there, we heard a big explosion,” said Nomawethu. The city’s Fire and Rescue Services spokesman Jermaine Carelse said they received the emergency call at 1.55 am. “When firefighters arrived at the scene on the corner of Symphony Way and Govan Mbeki, they found several informal structures alight but managed to contain and extinguish the blaze by 3.26 am,” said Carelse. He said the three shacks were destroyed and the bodies of two women were discovered among the debris. “Fire Services medics declared them dead,” said Carelse. Colonel Andre Traut said an death inquest docket was registered after two females died in a shack fire in the Thabo Mbeki settlement. “The circumstances are being investigated and the cause of the fire is yet to be determined.”
