WATCH your habits everyday and you might be closer to seeing your business productivity. That’s a word of advice for small business owners and entrepreneurs from Selina Bieber, regional director at GoDaddy. Here are tips on how you can beat bad habits: 1. Not taking care of yourself As an entrepreneur or small business owner, you are invested in the growth of your venture and will do what it takes to succeed. But it can be a mistake to put the health of your company above your own well-being. 2. Unnecessary meetings It’s not always easy to avoid meetings but keep them brief, draw up an agenda and wrap up with an action plan. 3. Putting important work off until tomorrow It’s easy to fool yourself into thinking you are being productive when you race through a lot of quick, easy tasks in the morning. Small business owners should think carefully about whether they are using their time in the best way. 4. Multitasking Many entrepreneurs pride themselves on their ability to wear every hat in the business and keep a number of balls in the air at the same time. But multi-tasking can often end up reducing workday productivity because you’re likely to make mistakes that you’ll later need to fix.
