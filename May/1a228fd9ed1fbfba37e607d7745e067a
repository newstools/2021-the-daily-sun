AB de Villiers is not going back on the decision he took three years ago when he quit the Proteas.  The star batsman had indicated he was planning to come out of international retirement and feature for South Africa in the T20 World Cup, scheduled for India in October and November.  But according to Cricket SA, De Villiers will not be coming back.  “Discussions with AB de Villiers have concluded with the batsman deciding, once and for all, that his retirement will remain final,” CSA confirmed.  A few weeks ago, Proteas coach Mark Boucher, whose team have lost five successive T20I series, sounded optimistic about De Villiers’s return.  He vowed to do his best to convince de Villiers to come out of international retirement, the 37-year-old having said he would be willing to play for South Africa once again if there was a possibility.  “There has been a lot of speculation, especially given how he has been playing in the IPL. Mark Boucher was very clear that he was having conversations with AB,” said convener of selectors Victor Mpitsang.  “Obviously he would always add value in whatever format he was playing, especially in a T20 World Cup. But I have not spoken to him personally and I have to respect the fact that he retired from international cricket.”
