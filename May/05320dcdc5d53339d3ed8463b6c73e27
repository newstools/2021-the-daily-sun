ORLANDO Pirates chairman Dr Irvin Khoza was among those who were first in line to get the vaccine in Munsieville, Krugersdorp. This as gogos and madalas braved the morning chill at Munsieville Care for the Aged to get their first jabs of the Pfizer vaccines. The Iron Duke told reporters: “In my business, the platform that I manage, I am paid to promote products. But today I am not paid for the products. “For the country to come back to normalcy, we must vaccinate. It’s very important coming here to inspire everybody who does business on our platform and everybody in the country that it is normal to vaccinate.  “There is no option available to anybody except to vaccinate. I have never doubted anything and never asked any questions.” He also thanked the government for prioritising the urgency to vaccinate the elderly.  Though there were previously fears of blood clotting, gogos and madalas were happy to get their first jabs. Because Pfizer is a double-dose vaccine, the elderly were given appointment cards with their next date.  Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize, Gauteng Premier David Makhura and MEC Nomathemba Mokgethi were part of the officials who were overseeing the inoculation processes in the West Rand.
