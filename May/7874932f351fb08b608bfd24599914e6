HE was selling traditional beer, but cops told him it was illegal. When he refused to throw the beer down the drain, the cops allegedly called him stubborn and then shot him. Elvis Kgatisi opened a case against the cops, but it was later withdrawn. The 44-year-old from Moruleng, North West now wants the case reopened. He said the incident happened in 1997. He said he started selling home-brewed umqombothi after he couldn’t find work. But one day, eight cops went to his house and asked why he was selling beer that could kill people. “They told me it was illegal to sell traditional beer and that I should destroy everything,” he said. “I was shocked because I had been selling the beer for two years and never had a problem.” Elvis said he grew up seeing people in his neighbourhood selling traditional beer. “I wanted to know what was different with me. Why was mine a deadly poison?” He said he pleaded with cops as he didn’t want to lose his business. “I refused to drain the beer. They called me stubborn and shot me nine times all over my body.” Elvis said he opened a case after the incident, but it was withdrawn after he couldn’t find legal representation. “I was told I couldn’t get a free legal representative because I was fighting the state. “I’m living with bullets in my body and I need the cops to tell me why they shot me. I want justice to be done.” After his case was withdrawn, he said he’s been trying all possible avenues to get it back on to the court roll, but failed as he couldn’t afford a lawyer He said when he recently told someone about his ordeal, he was advised to call Daily Sun for help. North West police spokeswoman Captain Aafje Botma said the case was not registered on the police system and advised Elvis to reopen it at Mogwase cop shop.
