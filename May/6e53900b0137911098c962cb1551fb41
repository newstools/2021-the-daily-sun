FORMER President Jacob Zuma may be going through some tough
times, but that seems to not be in his way to show off his dance moves. Amid his legal drama, with his legal team pulling off just
weeks before his corruption and the ‘impending’ arrest for defying the
constitutional court, Zuma seems to be happy at his Nkandla homestead with his
family. In a video recently posted online, the former president can
be seen with the members of his family jamming to the sounds of “Something You”
by Tyga featuring Chris Brown. Sam Ramakatsa tweeted "Mr Msholozi is an
all-rounder...he can sing, dance, make you laugh and angry, remember when he
used to laugh when asked questions in parliament." Aijaman Marcus Garvey said "Forget about Uncle
Vinny....uBaba is on another level" Tee Vee tweeted, "They can say what they want to say
about ubaba uMsholozi but he's got the vibe and charisma and a warm personality
that is why ordinary people will always like him, he is a bomb man at his age
look at those good moves, great staff." Former President Jacob Zuma dancing to a hip hop song ?? pic.twitter.com/T2ptWAi4N3
