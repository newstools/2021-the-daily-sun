COPS tracked down suspected killers at a hotel after they posted photos of themselves celebrating after a series of shocking shootings. The photos of the men were taken at a hotel in Sea Point, Cape Town, after 13 people were murdered in various parts of site B in Khayelitsha on Saturday, 15 May. Photos of the suspects eating, with bottles of booze in front of them, soon started circulating on social media. A source from ekasi told Daily Sun the suspects were known to be linked to a gang called AmaGupta. Photos of the men posing with guns were also circulating. “They were overexcited after allegedly killing people, so they posted the pictures of themselves celebrating,” said the source. “What they did was dumb because they should have lied low for a while after allegedly committing such heinous crimes. “They’ve been doing bad things and getting away with it. I hope this time the cops will lock them up forever.”  On Monday 17 May, acting Western Cape police commissioner Major-General Thembisile Patekile said 11 people had been arrested and questioned. He said the suspects were bust at about 3am in the morning after being tracked to a hotel in a rich area far away from the crime scene. “They were not in Khayelitsha. They booked themselves into a hotel. It boggles the mind,” he said. A community leader said the killings were an act of revenge after a gang member was shot while collecting protection money from a spaza shop. “These are some of the people extorting money from residents of Khayelitsha,” said the source. They are known gangsters who call themselves the Guptas and run an extortion ring,”
