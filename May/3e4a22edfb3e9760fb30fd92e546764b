Pain written in our eyes. Youth unemployment is reigning while our politics takes centre stage instead of helping those who voted” Victor Kariyo wrote: “I believe as Africans we have a lot to learn and do. You might ask where we can start from. I say Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X have given us a starting point. “Let’s not be ignorant of the state we are all in, and all the barriers that stand before and besides us. As Marcus dreamt, I believe Africa can be redeemed. When that day comes Africa will stand together. “Everyone should read Philosophy and opinions of Marcus Garvey and learn about our predecessors. For there’s nothing that’s happening now that hasn’t happened before. Make your choice, people. Stand for us all.”
