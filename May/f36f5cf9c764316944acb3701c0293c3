IT’S often said that consistency is key! And this is ringing true for Baroka FC striker Evidence Makgopa, Bongokuhle Hlongwane of Maritzburg United, Victor Letsoalo (Bloemfontein Celtic) and Themba Zwane of Mamelodi Sundowns. All have been nominated for the second successive season for various Premier Soccer League (PSL) Awards. The awards ceremony will take place on 6 June at 8pm, and will be broadcast live on the SuperSport PSL channel 202 and the SABC. Last season the four players were nominated, with Zwane being the big winner as he bagged the Footballer of the Season, Players Player of the Season and Midfielder of the Season awards. Again this year, the Sundowns star could be set to repeat his clean-up of three significant prizes as he has been nominated for the same prizes. Baroka prodigy striker Makgopa said he is confident that this time around, he will win the award. Makgopa is nominated in the Young Player of the Season category alongside Hlongwane and Kamogelo Mahlangu of TS Galaxy. Makgopa said: “This is a special feeling. It’s my second nomination and I am confident that I will bring it home. I have really worked hard this season, and honestly I believe I deserve it.” The youngster gave credit to the Baroka technical team and teammates for their continued support and for showing him the ropes as a youngster. He added: “The whole Baroka team, starting from the technical team to players, everyone played their part to help me. Now I just need to keep working hard, remain humble as always and work hard because the journey does not end here.” Last season Makgopa was nominated in the Nedbank Cup as the Most Promising Player, but he didn’t win. However, that did not break the youngster who went back to the drawing board and managed to bounce back stronger. His sterling displays this season has seen him being drafted into the South African Under-23 Olympic squad.
