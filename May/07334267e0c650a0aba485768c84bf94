AN ABANDONED house in Mandela section in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni has been giving residents a headache. This is because the house is a haven for thugs and nyaope addicts. What’s even worse, residents sometimes hear women screaming for help from the house. But when they call the cops, they apparently arrive late or don’t pitch at all. On Saturday, 22 May, residents invaded the house and what they found shocked them. They found used condoms strewn all over the house along with handbags and purses. The residents said it looked like victims were robbed and raped in the house. Resident Masuku Nkosi said: “We complain about the house to Etwatwa police, but they don’t take us seriously. They come here and say they didn’t get anything to make them take action.” The residents believe the police will only act after someone has died.  Another resident, Jeanette Magwaza, said she has two small girls and she always worries whenever they play outside. “Kids no longer play like they used to because we restrict them,” she said. The residents said the owners of the house died several years ago and it has since been taken over by nyaope addicts. Some residents said their clothes disappeared from washing lines and they suspect it could be the nyaope addicts. “We want help because we don’t want to take the law into our own hands,” said one of the residents. The residents told Daily Sun they were trying to avoid a situation like the one in Zandspruit in Honeydew, where nine men were assaulted by the community last week before burning them. Six died, while others are still in hospital. Sergeant Khensani Mathebula said they were not aware of the house and will visit it to see how best they can help.
