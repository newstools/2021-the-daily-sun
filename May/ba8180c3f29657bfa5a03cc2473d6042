WITH winter fast approaching and each day getting colder, people are finding different ways to stay warm. In a video that’s gone viral on social media, a pupil from an unknown school is seen spraying hand sanitiser on top of a desk in a classroom and lighting it up, while another is seen warming up their hands. People are concerned about this behaviour and have asked that teachers monitor kids when it comes to hand sanitisers. “That thing is highly flammable and it might cause danger to these kids,” said Soneke Zwane. Another concerned parent said her child told her about the incident not so long ago. She said it has become a trend in schools, especially because they don’t have heaters in classrooms. “I called her teacher to alert her. She told me she didn’t know and will start checking on them,” said Mpume Dlamini. Thato Ngwato said if he was making rules in school, he wouldn’t allow kids to bring sanitisers. “They need to be sanitised by teachers. This is a great concern and people shouldn’t take it lightly,” said Thato. Another parent advised teachers to be on the look out as this may cause more problems. “Never mind the desks being damaged, playing with fire has always been a terrible thing,” said Lindiwe Khoza. Gauteng Provincial Education spokesman, Steve Mabona said he's not aware of this video but the department will look into it. In the meantime, he's advising pupils against this activity.
