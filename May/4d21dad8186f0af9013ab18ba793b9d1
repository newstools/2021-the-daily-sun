WEST Ham United manager David Moyes said his team were guilty of poor finishing in Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Percy Tau’s Brighton & Hove Albion which dented their hopes of finishing in the Premier League’s top four. Danny Welbeck fired Brighton into the lead before Hammers substitute Said Benrahma scored the equaliser as the London club moved to 59 points with two games left. West Ham are five points adrift of fourth-placed Chelsea who also have two matches to play. “I thought we controlled long periods of the game but we gave away a really bad goal,” said Moyes whose side are also in danger of missing out on a second-tier Europa League berth. “It was probably our play in the final third where we didn’t do enough. We didn’t make a good enough final pass or make enough contact when we had a chance to score. Some moments weren’t good and we gave up quite a lot of opportunities to make better chances.” West Ham play away to relegated side West Bromwich Albion tomorrow and host Southampton in the final game of the season on 23 May.
