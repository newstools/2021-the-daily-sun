BIZANA Pondo Chiefs could kiss their GladAfrica Championship status goodbye tomorrow, without even kicking a ball. A win for another relegation-threatened side Cape Town Spurs against Pretoria Callies at Parrow Park (3pm) will mean it is all over for Pondo Chiefs, who are scheduled to face Polokwane City on Sunday at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. The two teams will be relegated, and with third bottom Spurs sitting on 30 points after 27 games, a win for the Cape Town-based outfit will see them reach 33 points. Chiefs, who have 20 points with three matches remaining, will be doomed. That will mean Chiefs are going back to ABC Motsepe League after just one season in the Championship. Then the battle for other teams that will go down will be between Spurs and 15th-placed Steenberg United, who have 28 points each. Chiefs have struggled this season and have spent the better half of the season rooted at the bottom of the log. The experience of veteran players like Sandile Zuke, Lerato Manzini, Musa Bilankulu, Mbongeni Mzimela and Deolin Mekoa has not paid dividends. Chiefs coach Clinton Larsen had admitted they would need a miracle to survive. However, they all but blew their chances on Wednesday when they lost 3-2 to Cape Town All Stars. The University of Pretoria and Cape Town All Stars are also not safe. They have 32 points each, and if they lose all three remaining matches and Spurs win two games, Spurs will be safe. At the top of the standings, there is drama as well. Richards Bay FC, who have spent over 10 weeks at the top, could lose their number one spot. The Natal Rich Boyz are leading with 45 points, followed by Royal AM, who have 44 points. Royal AM play TS Sporting at Chatsworth Stadium tomorrow, and a win will take them to the top with 47 points.
