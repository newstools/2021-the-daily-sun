SEKHUKHUNE United have been handed over a massive boost in their quest to be crowned
2020-21 GladAfrica Championship winners. Sekhukhune on Friday filed an urgent application to
the Johannesburg High Court to have the PSL enforce the ruling that was
handed down by Safa arbitrator Advocate Hilton Epstein on 19 May. The urgent application will sit on 3 June where the
club is hoping the court will order the PSL to enforce the arbitrator's
decision, and allocate the three points to Sekhukhune. The
arbitrator nullified the PSL's DC ruling that deducted three points from
Polokwane City for breaching the league's
rules after failing to have five Under-23 players in their squad against
Sekhukhune. But the DC didn't allocate the points, which
Sekhukhune is arguing. The match was played earlier in the year under
protest, though at the time didn't have any effect on who wins the
Championship, but the league DC delayed to come up with a finding on the
matter. And the arbitrator's ruling of allocating Sekhukhune
with the points brought about confusion as their closest rivals on the league
table, Royal AM, are now affected, as they now top the log with 51 points,
while Sekhukhune are second with 50. However, the PSL's failure to enforce Epstein’s
ruling, opting to challenge the matter, while City also challenge the judgement
in court, halted the crowning of the new Championship winners. In
the turn of events, City have removed their application from the court roll on
Friday and asked for a new date, which is set for 8 June, with the PSL
allegedly joining in as co-applicant in a bid to overturn the arbitrator's
ruling. An
insider at Sekhukhune says it’s unfair to wait longer while the  award by
the arbitrator is not enforced. “It’s
unfair because the arbitrator has made the judgement and PSL are not enforcing
it. Hopefully this urgent application will speed up the process,” said the
source.
