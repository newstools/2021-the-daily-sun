THEY plan to have a big wedding celebration to make up for one that was disrupted last year. This after cops disrupted Dumisani Zondi (47) and 37-year-old Thabile Ngcobo’s wedding at Nseleni outside Richards Bay, KZN. They were arrested for contravening lockdown regulations. Now Dumisani plans to take the traditional wedding to his hometown in Greytown. “I want this wedding to be massive and memorable. I’m doing this because I promised my wife I’ll give her the wedding of her dreams. This time I want nothing to distract us,” said Dumisani. He said his brother is getting married in July and he will have to wait. “We will have our wedding between October and November. This will give us time to raise more money so that everything will be on point,” he said. Dumisani said the only thing that will help them erase the memories of their crashed wedding is a big and perfect traditional wedding. “The wedding was interrupted before we could cut the wedding cake.

Thabile said she was numb for days after the incident last year. “I cried so much that my husband’s effort to give me my dream wedding went down the drain. “My heart still feels heavy whenever I think about everything that happened that day,” said Thabile. She said she’s looking forward to the traditional wedding and prays everything goes well. The couple was released the following day after paying a fine of R1 500 each while their 50 guests, including the pastor, were released on warning.
