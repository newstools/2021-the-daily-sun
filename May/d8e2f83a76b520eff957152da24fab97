Former Miss SA Jo-Ann Strauss has saluted nannies and described them as co-mothers. To make them feel special, she invited people to tell her why their nannies were special so she could deposit R1 000 into those nannies’ bank accounts. In an Instagram post, she wrote: “Me scanning the horizon and waiting on my nanny to arrive on a Monday morning. “Let’s be honest, the South African economy depends heavily on these incredible women who look after our kids when we’re at work and who make sure we look like we have our things together. “I’d like to propose that we start a National Nanny Day (does that exist?) or a day on which we honour the domestic nannies who often have to leave their own families to help us raise ours.” Boitumelo Mothupi wrote: “My kids’ nanny is one of a kind. I lost my mother and had to take care of my two kids by myself. She came into our lives and took over. “She loves my kids like hers. She took my five-year-old, who has special needs, out of the nappies and taught him to say when he needs the bathroom as well as how to write, play and eat by himself.” ALSO READ |  KULI ROBERTS: REST IN PEACE MY BABY Rebecca Badrodin said her nanny was her everything. She wrote: “She was there for us when I had to go to hospital at midnight and 3am to have babies. “She’s slept with the kids when I couldn’t be around. She looked after me post-partum when family couldn’t because of Covid. “She’d arrive at 6am because she knows the kids wake up that early just so I could go back to sleep.” Ashanti queen wrote: “My nanny, Mama Sophia, has been my rock for 15 years. She’s stood by me and helped me raise all three of my children: 16, 10 and 9. “She’s so generous and loving. I lost my husband seven years ago. I was in such a dark place. “The grief was so unbearable I wouldn’t get out of bed, but Ma Sophie was a constant rock for our family.”
