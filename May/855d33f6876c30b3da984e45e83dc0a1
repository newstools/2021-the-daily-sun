THE Zulu royal house’s annual budget allocation from the KZN government has been slashed by R5 million. This was announced by KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala on Friday, 14 May, when he delivered his 2021/2022 budget in the KZN Legislature in Pietermaritzburg. The new budget allocated to newly appointed King Misuzulu kaZwelithini is R 66, 074 million from 71,3 million last year. Zikalala said as the provincial government, they are ready to provide the necessary support to the Zulu royal house during this period and beyond. “The KZN Traditional Leadership and Governance Act No 5 of 2005 in Section 17 provides for the recognition of Isilo (king) as the monarch of KwaZulu-Natal, or king as defined in Section 1 of the Framework Act. “In established practice, we have therefore clearly defined the role and relevance of the institution of monarchy and the obligations of the provincial government to the royal house,” he said. Zikalala tabled his budget after he met with the king on Thursday. Zikalala said working together with the royal house, they will soon finalise and announce the date for the king’s coronation. “This will be the first coronation in a long time and will be a fitting tribute to His Majesty King Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu who would have reached 50 years on the throne this year. “The R66,074 million is allocated for activities including the hosting of annual traditional and cultural events to preserve the Zulu culture, as well as the hosting of heritage events such as the king’s coronation day and prayer day events,” he said. On Thursday King Misuzulu finalised his lobola for Ntokozo Mayisela where he paid eight cows and R50 000. He registered his marriage at Home Affairs two weeks ago is expected and is expected to have his traditional wedding soon. He said some of the king’s activities and events for the remainder of the financial year include, Umkhosi Wesivivane, Umkhosi weLembe (King Shaka’s commemoration) and Umkhosi Womhlanga (Reed Dance festival).
