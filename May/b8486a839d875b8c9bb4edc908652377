STATE Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo ignored state regulations when she recently promoted 26 people to senior positions. This was what inspector-general of intelligence Setlhomamaru Dintwe told the Zondo Commission yesterday. He said Dlodlo went ahead with the appointments knowing the acting director-general of the department had refused to recommend them. He said most of the 26 were recalled from retirement. He said it was not unusual for people to be hired or promoted at the department without processes being followed. Commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo appeared shocked when he asked whether this happened after the commission previously heard about problems at the department. “It happened recently. They are yet to receive their first salaries, sir,” Dintwe responded. He said most of them were connected to the department’s previous management. Dintwe said the State Security Agency was facing a challenge with 40 operatives who were employed without criteria being followed, and were unhappy that they were not placed in positions they were promised. He said this happened because ministers, managers and officials ran the recruitment programme and appointed their children, friends and relatives. “More often than not we found there would be familial relations between people who were appointed and political principals or senior managers. For us that is nepotism,” Dintwe said. He told the commission that the agency was a cash cow for corrupt officials. He said in one instance, an official requested R2,7 million in cash and it just disappeared. Dintwe also referred to various media reports about a failed attempt by crime intelligence to get a precise mobile surveillance device called a grabber to use during the 2017 ANC conference at Nasrec. The device cost R7 million but they wanted R45 million. He said it was easy to defraud the agency as it used cash to conduct its operations.
