NEW Cape Town City coach, Eric Tinkler, must not try and lure away Baroka FC assistant coach Vincent “Parks” Kobola. This is the massage from Baroka manager Richard Mashabane reacting to reports that Tinkler has been linked with rehiring Kobola as his assistant at the Citizens. Tinkler rejoined the Mother City outfit this week, succeeding Jan Olde Riekerink. The Bafana Bafana legend has worked with the former Moroka Swallows and Jomo Cosmos defender as his assistant at previous clubs. Kobola has assisted the 50-year-old Roodepoort-born mentor at Chippa United and Maritzburg United. However, Mashabane made it clear that Kobola is going nowhere. “Kobola is happy at Baroka,” said Mashabane. “He (Kobola) has been working well with our coach Thoka Matsimela and we don’t want that partnership to end. Kobola is an important member of our technical team and we want him to stay. “Talks that Tinkler wants him (Kobola) are just rumours and we are not taking them seriously.” Kobola joined Bakgaga this season to assist Matsimela. Baroka are well known for fighting relegation since they were promoted to the top flight five years ago. But this season, under Matsimela and Kobola as his deputy, the Ga-Mphahlele-based side are now fighting to finish in the top eight. Baroka are currently eighth on the DStv Premiership log with 33 points from 28 league matches. Baroka host Orlando Pirates in their penultimate league encounter at Peter Mokaba Stadium next Wednesday (5pm).
