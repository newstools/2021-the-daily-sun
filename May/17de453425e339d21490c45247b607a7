ARCHBISHOP Emeritus Desmond Tutu and his wife, Leah, were vaccinated at Brooklyn Chest Hospital in Milnerton, Cape Town, yesterday (17 May). This as the Western Cape government launched the Phase 2 vaccination programme targeting elderly citizens over the age of 60. Speaking after getting his jab, Tutu said being vaccinated was the right thing to do. “I have tried to do the right thing all my life and today, getting vaccinated against Covid-19 is definitely the right thing. That’s why Leah and I took this step – to do our part to start the national healing process so we can end this pandemic. We have to do this together!” said Tutu. He also thanked healthcare workers for risking their lives while protecting the nation. “I salute all of you in the front lines, who have been working to keep us safe for more than a year now. God bless you for your selfless service to our citizens and country.” The roll-out was hosted by MEC of Health Dr Nomafrench Mbombo, with premier Alan Winde in attendance. Mbombo said having the elderly vaccinated meant the group that was vulnerable to Covid-19 was protected, and that would also ease the burden on the healthcare system. “Getting them vaccinated means they are protected from the virus and will not be flocking our health facilities. This in turn will protect our health system and give us a bit of normalcy. We can re-integrate other health services, reduce the burden of illnesses, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19, to which senior citizens contribute largely,” said Mbombo. The MEC urged people to help the elderly register online for vaccination. “I appeal to the young people to assist in registering the elderly. It is our responsibility. We are not safe until we are all vaccinated,” she added.
