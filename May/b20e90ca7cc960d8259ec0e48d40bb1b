YET another police officer has been arrested. A 31-year-old constable has been nabbed for allegedly
attempting to kill her boyfriend on Tuesday night in Ficksburg, Free State. The police constable checked her boyfriend’s phone and after
finding whatever she was looking for on the phone, all hell broke loose as she
confronted him for cheating. She allegedly pulled out the service pistol and fired
several shots towards him. But the boyfriend was lucky and saved by his
girlfriend's poor shooting skills. On Wednesday The Independent Police Investigative
Directorate (IPID) spokeswoman, Ndileka Cola said in a statement, “It is
alleged that the 31-year-old Police Constable stationed at Ficksburg Police

their vehicle to speak to his police Constable girlfriend. “As alleged, the boyfriend went to the police vehicle in
which the girlfriend was in to speak to her crew. Whilst he was there, the
girlfriend went to her boyfriend's vehicle and checked his cellphone. “It is alleged that the officer then went to her boyfriend
and confronted him for cheating on her. 
As they argued, she allegedly took out her official firearm and fired

present at the scene took the firearm from the officer,” she Cola. IPID attended the crime scene and arrested the police
