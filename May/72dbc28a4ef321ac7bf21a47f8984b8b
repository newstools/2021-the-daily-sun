THE family of a woman who was killed allegedly by her Ben 10 baby daddy said they don’t want him to get bail. Zonke Dlamini (47) from Khilimoni Village in Bulwer, KZN Midlands, was found dead in her bed on Monday, 24 May. Her brother Mhlanganyelwa Dlamini (64) said the family made the gruesome discovery. “We’d all gone to a traditional ceremony and slept there, but because the hosts were our relatives, Zonke and her baby daddy didn’t sleep over. “The following day when the rest of the family returned home, we found Zonke’s house locked. We found it strange that she, her baby daddy and their son were nowhere to be seen.” ALSO READ: NEWLYWEDS FORCED TO STAY AT STADIUM ALL NIGHT! Mhlanganyelwa said after they forcibly opened the door, they found Zonke lying in bed with blood stains on the floor. “We tried calling the suspect but he was unavailable. We called his dad and notified him about the ordeal.” Mhlanganyelwa said the dad told them the suspect wasn’t home but promised he’d let them know as soon as he was home. “Indeed, he later called us and told us he’d arrived. He told us he’d called the local men, including a ward councillor, so they could assist in apprehending the suspect and hand him over to the police,” said Mhlanganyelwa. “Because of the pain he’s caused us and the manner in which he killed a defenceless woman, leaving six kids including his own four-year-old motherless, he surely doesn’t deserve to live in the outside world. He deserves to be locked up.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was opened at Bulwer Police Station for investigation. “Police received a complaint of a murder and proceeded to the scene. On arrival, they found the body of a woman with an open wound on the head and bruises on the arms. “It’s alleged the victim was killed by a known suspect who thereafter left the area,” said Gwala. She said KwaMsane police arrested the suspect in the Mfekaye area in Mtubatuba for murder and he’d appear in court soon.
