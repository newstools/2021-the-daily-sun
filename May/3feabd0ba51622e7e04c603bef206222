THE Nelson Mandela Museum in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, is set to get its first statue on Mandela Day, 20 years after it was opened. A source said it was embarrassing that a museum named after a world icon has no statue. “The museum was established in 2010. “It’s supposed to have a huge significance when it comes to the life of Nelson Mandela. Unfortunately, this is not the case,” said the source. “We’ve been requesting funding from the relevant departments for the past 20 years, but were declined on the basis of a lack of funds.” Daily Sun understands more than 50 wax statues were brought in from Durban for an exhibition.

I’ve also included his ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, his comrades OR Tambo, Walter Sisulu, former president Thabo Mbeki, as well as struggle icons from the Eastern Cape.” He said the statues will be displayed for three months and sold if an individual or institution is interested in buying them. Neli Twala, senior manager at the Nelson Mandela Museum, said they’d established a working relationship with Lungelo. “The exhibition is already running and will end on the last day of July.” The museum’s Phumeza Mandela said: “It’s the first time we’ve this kind of exhibition and we feel honoured to have these statues. “One statue will be at the museum and another one will in Qunu. We invite the public and tourists to come and see the story of a world icon being told.”
