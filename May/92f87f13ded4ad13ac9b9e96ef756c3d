SABC 2’s popular drama series is opening up the industry. Muvhango, created by veteran producer and director Duma Ndlovu, is adding a new addition to the family. Actress and model Michelle Malange has scored herself the role of Shudu Sibudi, a young teenage girl who’s passionate about life and not too naive. She’ll be introduced through her boyfriend as their teenage troubles and life story unfolds into drama. “The year 2021 will also mark the debut of a number of fresh-faced newbies, hoping to carve out a niche for themselves in the industry. We want Muvhango to be a platform of endless opportunities for young and ambitious actors,” said producer Herbert Hadebe. Duma told Daily Sun that his production company, Word of Mouth Pictures, was on a mission to open up the industry. “It’s vital to give a chance to new talent. As a production company, we’re proud to be a springboard for budding talent,” he said. ALSO READ |  SKEEM SAAM CHANGING THINGS UP! Muvhango has seen a number of new talent since its inception. In the past, the show gave a dream launch to debutants including Sindi Dlathu and Khanyi Mbau, who have since went on to become big stars. Late last year, Word of Mouth Pictures also launched the Golden Elephant Award and recognised actor John Kani’s contribution to the industry after being presented with a lifetime achievement award. The Black Panther actor was the first to receive the recently launched award. “We decided to honour him because of his lasting impact on the industry,” said Duma, adding that the awards were different. “They’re different from the Saftas and Royalty Soapie Awards. You don’t have to appear on a soapie or telenovela to be honoured. There’s no panel of judges. The awards are from a production company that says: we have not celebrated enough people.” A post shared by Muvhango (@muvhangosa)
