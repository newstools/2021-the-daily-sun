LEHLOHONOLO Seema has been fired by Black Leopards, SunSport has been reliably told. And this comes hours before an important match against Chippa United, which could decide their fate in the DStv Preiership. Even the club's team sheet, released on Wednesday, an hour before kick-off of their Chippa game at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Morgan Shivambu was listed as head coach, assisted by Mongezi Bobe. Seema hung up in the morning when approached about the information gathered by SunSport, and Leopards general manager, Tshifhiwa Thidiela, insisted at the time that Seema was still a very much part of the team. Thidiela refuted the claims that Seema was axed after Lidoda Duvha were hammered 3-0 by Orlando Pirates last week. “He was fired after the Pirates game and it was instruction from the management,” said the first source. Another source added: “He’s (Seema) no longer at Black Leopards and was fired after the game against Pirates. He can’t talk about the issue because he’s still owed money by the club. That’s why the coach is not answering journalists' calls.” Seema’s departure may not come as a surprise as the PSL strugglers have been at the bottom for the table for the better part of the season. They have only collected 18 points after 26 matches, having won just four. Leopards, who are six points behind Chippa, are in action today as they visit the Chilli Boys, Seema’s former club, at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium (3pm). Shivambu and Bobe are back on the hot-seat like last season to save the club via the promotion/relegation play-offs. LISTEN: Seema was initially appointed as the assistant coach in December last year after he left Chippa. He was then appointed coach in January this year after Dylan Kerr had left Lidoda Duvha. Kerr had replaced Belgian coach Patrick Aussems, who was appointed in October last year before leaving the club the following month.
