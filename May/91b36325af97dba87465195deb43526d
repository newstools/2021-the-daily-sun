ANGRY street vendors protested over trading permits on Friday, 7 May. This was after law enforcement officials went to the Vereeniging CBD in the Vaal to enforce municipal by-laws. But vendors felt they were illegally removed and started throwing rocks at police cars and trashing the CBD. Vendor Mzandwile Sotobe (32) told Daily Sun the Emfuleni Municipality’s economic development department was not performing its duties, according to the law. “We do want to comply with by-laws but how do you do that when officials don’t do any work? We go to the municipal offices to apply for permits, but we don’t get help. Now they resort to removing us without even consulting us,” he said. George Maluleke (38) said the municipality should not have removed them like animals. “The least they could have done was to bring a vehicle here with equipment to check who was complying and who was not,” he said. “Rather than chasing us away, they should have forced those who don’t comply to register with their system. Because they are incompetent and don’t do their jobs, they think the best way is to remove us. Do your job and let us do our jobs.” The vendors said they were unemployed and had no other source of income. Municipal spokesman Makhosonke Sangweni said the operation targeted several crime hotspots and areas where by-laws were being violated. “Hawkers found without operating permits were shut down and ordered to comply. This led to a standoff between law enforcement officers and angry vendors,” he said. “On Monday, 10 May, the programme to register all hawkers in the Vereeniging CBD will start. All vendors are advised to visit the economic development department at the OK Building in Vanderbijlpark to apply for permits.” Police spokesman Captain Fikile Funda said they were on the scene to back up by-law officers and four vendors were arrested.
