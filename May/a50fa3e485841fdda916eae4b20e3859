SOUTH Africa poster boy and World 400 metres record holder Wayde van Niekerk landed safe in the United States to continue his Olympic preparations. Van Niekerk will train in the USA for the Tokyo Olmpics under the guidance of new coach Lance Brauman. Van Niekerk, 28, is making a comeback after seriously injuring his knee during a rugby game in October 2017. He will be hoping to defend his 400m Olympic title at this year's Games in Tokyo, which get underway in July. Van Niekerk, who had spent his entire career under coach Ans Botha before joining Brauman recently, has been struggling to get clearance to travel to the USA but he has now landed in Florida. Brauman is also the coach of 200m world champion Noah Lyles and 400m women’s Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who took to Instagram on Tuesday to welcome Van Niekerk to the stable. In Florida van Niekerk will rub shoulders with 2019 World Champion Noah Lyles and Bahamian superstar Shaune Miller-Uibo. “As much as I have enjoyed my experience with Tannie Ans and her group, I am hoping to break my world record and to do that I need to ensure I am training alongside the world’s best sprinters,” van Niekerk said in February this year.“So I feel a temporary move to the United States will be in my best interests for the immediate future.” Been an amazing first Day in the US meeting my new team.
