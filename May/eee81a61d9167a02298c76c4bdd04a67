“I’M sorry they killed you, king. They could never take your spirit though, only your handsome and your talented body.” This was the moving post by Lindsay Myeni, the wife of KZN rugby player Lindani Myeni (29), after the family and a KZN delegation welcomed his body home. His remains landed at the OR Tambo International Airport in Ekurhuleni on Saturday. Myeni was shot and killed by US police in Hawaii on 14 April This morning his body completed a three-day journey from the US, via London. He’s going to be buried in his home province of KZN. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala lashed out at the US government for the manner in which they handled Myeni’s case. Zikalala had previously told Daily Sun: “Judging by their attitude, we can only conclude they lack respect for black lives. We call on the people of this province, the country, Africa and the world not to keep quiet about this injustice. Being black is not a scourge.” “This injustice cannot, and should not, be left unchallenged. Therefore, as the province of KwaZulu-Natal, we are calling on South Africans to rise up and make a strong statement against this abomination. We are also calling for intervention from the highest office in the US,” he said. The father of two died after he was gunned down by police who responded to a “burglary in progress” call. A recording of the 911 call made on the night has been released. The caller can be heard telling the police that Lindani doesn’t have any weapons on him. Lindani returns home, to lie in eternal rest in the fertile soil of the African garden and next to his next of kin. #LindaniMyeni pic.twitter.com/e0szgpiORz  A short prayer service will be held by the receiving committee and the family.
