I’VE always in my head married coffee and sex together. I mean, they are just the most compatible couple of them all. They both are amazing to have in the morning, both provide great stimulus for the body and like Pharrell Williams’ song, they both make everyone happy. Can you see how perfect they are for each other? Well, according to recent research, this wedding will have to wait a while because these two aren’t exactly compatible. According to Women’s Health magazine, people would rather have coffee than have sex. According to a new survey done by Le Meridien Hotels and Resorts, people would rather have a dose of caffeine than a shot of orgasms. Researchers conducted the survey by calling 7 455 people mainly from the United States, Dubai, China, France, Germany and India. The research found that 51% of respondents said they could go longer without sex than they could without coffee, and 62% said they would ditch alcohol for the morning pick-me-up. The majority of the people from the survey said drinking coffee stimulates their creativity and helps them relax. While the morning glory has its rise and shine benefits, people in the survey would rather stick to something hot with a dash of sweetness.
