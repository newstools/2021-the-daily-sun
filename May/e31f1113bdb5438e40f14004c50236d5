ALL political parties participating in the parliamentary inquiry to deal with the impeachment of the public protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, will have proportional voting rights on the matter. This was the decision of National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise yesterday when she announced she has increased the number of the parliamentary committee from 21 to 36 members from the 14 political parties represented in parliament. Modise made an about turn after UDM leader Bantu Holomisa complained bitterly over the fact that only bigger parties would be eligible to vote. The move could throw Mkhwebane a lifeline to stay in her position, as she will need two thirds of the vote to keep her job. With ANC divided along factional lines, it will go down to whether or not the party will instruct its MPs to toe the party line. When the National Assembly voted on the matter on 16 March, its members voted according to instructions from Luthuli House and some party MPs didn’t taking part. This was after suspended secretary general Ace Magashule said ANC MPs wouldn’t vote with the enemy as the motion was tabled by the DA. On the day of the voting, however, party chairman Gwede Mantashe and treasurer Paul Mashatile addressed the ANC caucus and read the MPs the Riot Act telling them to toe the party line. The revised composition of the committee, which Modise said would be to be implemented immediately, would have 19 ANC members. The DA would have four which will vote against her, while the EFF will have two that are guaranteed to vote in favour of Mkhwebane. The rest of the political parties, including ATM which had formerly expressed it wouldn’t participate, will be represented by one member. “The committee’s report must give findings, recommendations and reasons for their recommendations. Such a report must also be scheduled for consideration and debate in the National Assembly with appropriate urgency,” Modise said.
