LIMPOPO-BORN musician King Monada, who made his mark when he released hit song Malwedhe, has challenged Big Zulu to a boxing fight. The talented producer, whose real name is Khutso Kgatle, took to social media to say: “I challenge Big Zulu to a boxing match, and I am waiting for him to accept.” Big Zulu responded: “Akekho oncono.” Loosely translated, that means there is no one better who can challenge me, and the response left everyone in stitches.

After their match, can someone please lend me DJ Maphorisa? I want to show him some respect, but it must be kick-boxing,” he said. Maphorisa responded: “See, they can’t make hits anymore. Now they want to fight.
