NELSON Mandela Bay businesses continue to count costs as the ongoing taxi drivers’ strike flares up. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the cops are investigating a case of malicious damage to property after eight buses were set alight and completely destroyed in Motherwell at about 9pm on Wednesday, 26 May. She said: “It’s alleged that while the security guard was conducting his routine patrols around the depot, he noticed a bus on fire. He ran to get help and by the time he returned, other buses were burning. No injuries were sustained. The estimated value of the buses that were damaged is R12 million.” Provincial Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said: “Patients and healthcare workers at the Motherwell Clinic were removed from the facility by a group of protesters. The group stormed the facility on Wednesday night and intimidated and forcibly chased out both staff and patients.”  Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Nqaba Bhanga said he will meet taxi drivers together with his MMC for road and transport Rano Kayser in a bid to resolve the dispute between drivers and taxi owners. Since Tuesday, the Uncendo Taxi Association taxi drivers took to the streets demanding Covid-19 relief funds from Uncendo Taxi Association bosses. The drivers’ strike brought the city to a standstill, leaving commuters stranded and schools closed due to safety concerns.
