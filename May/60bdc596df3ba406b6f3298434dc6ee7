CITY of Tshwane spokesman Selby Bokaba has set the record straight about the video of the scuffle that broke out on Monday at Tshwane House. The viral video was shared on social media, with many users claiming suspended ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule had snuck into Luthuli House to attack the president. Bokaba rubbished the claims, telling Daily Sun the incident in the video happened at Tshwane House, not Luthuli. He said a few members of a newly formed political movement had a meeting with the MMC for human settlements in the Metro. “They’d come to Tshwane House to raise issues of service delivery, specifically relating to land and houses,” he said. “They had a meeting with the MMC. While they were wrapping up, the protector of the MMC informed her that she had another meeting to go to. “The members got angry as they’d not finished the meeting, even though the protector was trying to get her out. They were angry at the protector, not the MMC. “They wanted to attack the protector and he was trying to defend himself.” The video surfaced just days after Magashule filled in court papers in a bid to have his suspension reversed, and challenging the party’s step-aside resolution. “We were shocked when people posted that video. Instead of re-tweeting it, try to verify certain things because people spread fake news knowing that some social media activists are gullible. By re-tweeting, they’re spreading that,” said Bokaba.
