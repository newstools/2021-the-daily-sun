WHILE some see this as a beautiful thing to do for the dead, others think it’s ridiculous. A shocking video of a grave decorated in pink and green has been circulating on social media and people said whoever that grave belongs to will haunt the family. “I thought I’ve seen it all shame, but I’ve learned that you can never say you’ve seen it all in Mzansi. Whoever came up with that idea is going through a lot. Does soil even go into the grave because wow, it looks like a graveyard shower,” said Tumelo Mokoena. Another shocked social media user said this looks like torture for the dead. He said he fears that whoever will be resting there won’t rest in peace. “Since when do we decorate graves? People are really out of their minds and I’m really worried,” said Linda Smith. Clement Shabalala said he’s worried about what kind of an ancestor that person will turn out to be. “I can’t help but imagine how dramatic that ancestor will be. I mean, imagine sleeping on soil covered in decorations, I’d be dramatic too,” he said. Minky said as much as people are finding this funny, she thinks it’s cute and recommends families do it. “When I showed this to my mom, she made me swear that I don’t do this to her grave but I can’t promise. It’s beautiful,” said Minky. Sindiswa Mabena also said she loves this. “I want mine to be gold and black. Entlek, I want an entire theme for my funeral to be gold and black. I think it’s beautiful and classy,” said Sindiswa.
