PITSO Mosimane has courted controversy ahead of arguably one of his biggest games as coach of Al Ahly. The outspoken Mosimane has been slapped with a fine for “hate speech”, following his comments about the tight fixture list in the Egyptian Premier League. But the 20 thousand Egyptian pounds fine will barely distract him when he faces the “monster” he created, Mamelodi Sundowns, in a potentially explosive Caf Champions League quarter-finals tie in Cairo on Saturday. Shortly after their taxing Cairo Derby against Zamalek on Monday, Mosimane bemoaned the jammed fixture list in Egypt, knowing the effects big back-to-back games could have on a team. “They (Sundowns) are resting, we are playing. So, what does it mean to you?” said Mosimane. “If I had my way because Ahly is the only team that is playing in the Caf Champions League representing Egypt, we would protect Ahly. We don’t put the game of Zamalek, most especially when Sundowns are pushing their games back. We didn’t even rest. But it is the way it is in Egypt. But one day more, one day less… it doesn’t mean that we will lose the pressure. But, yes of course the conditions are different.” The Egyptian FA has confirmed that Mosimane had been fined
for 'hate speech'. The epic Champions League fixture couldn’t have come at the worst time, as Mosimane battles critics, who have started to lay into him for below-par performances in the Egyptian Premier League.
