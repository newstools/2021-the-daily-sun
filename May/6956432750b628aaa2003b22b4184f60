The Interim Board
of Cricket South Africa (CSA) wishes to reconfirm its full support for the
Social Justice and Nation-Building (SJN) process and ultimately the objectives
of enhancing and accelerating transformation. The
Board confirms that, at no point, was it seeking to delay a meaningful
process in relation to transformation, but rather to postpone by a few
days in order to strengthen the process. However, over
the past weekend, it became very clear that there
were significant legal and
fiduciary risks which the Board and the Ombudsman
were obligated to consider and manage before the hearing could
proceed. It was then agreed, with full support from the
Ombud, that the proposed hearings for last Monday would be postponed until
the Board had properly addressed all the risks facing the SJN
process, the Ombud and CSA. The Board has a
fiduciary responsibility to ensure that any risk to CSA is mitigated and
the Ombud has supported this in the knowledge that the SJN process
and CSA needed to be protected. It was on that basis that a
statement, confirmed by the Ombud and the Interim Board, was released
late on Sunday night. Chair of the Board,
Dr Stavros Nicolaou, said: “Regrettably there has been inaccurate
reporting regarding the postponement of the hearings and we have also noted
that testimony has been leaked. This is most unfortunate as
it will possibly compromise the SJN initiative. “We are confident,
though, that the legal advice sought will help the Ombudsman to
establish a fair and transparent process for any future hearings and this
will mitigate the risk for CSA.”
