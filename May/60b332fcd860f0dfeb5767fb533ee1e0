AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy said they lost their DStv Premiership match on Thursday night because of the referee, Orlando Pirates, did not beat them. Siyabulela Qunta was the man in charge of the match and was assisted by Xolani Boneni, Thembinkosi Mangai, and Sandile Dilakane was the fourth match official on the day. Qunta's performance left McCarthy unimpressed, and he could not hold back after suffering a 1-0 defeat against Pirates. "Today was just a joke and I wasn't going to do that because I know you going to get warnings, you going to get fines, that's fine. Today I don't care," angry McCarthy told SuperSport TV after the match. "We got beaten by the referee, not by Orlando Pirates, listen if I am under pressure about my job, you do anything when your job is hanging by a thread. Losing is part of football. I am not bitter. I can take losing but when you lose in that manner, not against your opponent but the man in the middle, this is a joke? "It's the first time I've seen this referee, how can the league even consider him a game of this magnitude the team that wants to finish second is behind you." McCarthy added: "Come on, we expect the DStv Premiership to raise the standard, we are up there, teams are upping up their games, but the officiating is diabolical, and you cannot say ah coaches always complain." This was Usuthu's first back to back defeat since the arrival of McCarthy late last year. However, McCarthy remains confident that they will secure a top-two berth and qualify for Caf Champions League. He stated: "We know what we have to do (in the remaining matches, we have two games more left, they are still four points behind us."
