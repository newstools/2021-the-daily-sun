ORLANDO Pirates players lack of understanding what their coach Josef Zinnbauer requires from them on the pitch could have led to their humiliating 3-0 hammering to Mamelodi Sundowns in a DStv Premiership match over the weekend. Bucs’ midfielder Thabang Monare posted a Video bizarrely revealing that sometimes he doesn’t understand the coach’s instruction on the pitch. The 31-year-old thought he was the only one who has a problem of memorising instructions from the German born mentor only to realise that his teammate Ben Motshwari also has a similar problem. Maybe a Zulu translator could be the remedy they need to end Sundowns dominance over them.
