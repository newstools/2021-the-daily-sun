GROWING up, Reneilwe Mashilo loved the mountains around her village so much she ended up becoming a geologist. The 26-year-old from Ga-Maila Village in Sekhukhune, Limpopo, told Daily Sun she had a special connection with rocks, especially milky quartz. “When you put pressure on milky quartz in the dark, it makes sparks and some even believe it helps with memory recall.” Reneilwe said she loves plants such as aloe, mokgoto and mopharafene, that even catches fire when it’s wet. “All these plants are found in my beautiful village. They’ll just bring you closer to your roots,” she said. Reneilwe, owner of Marlene Mountain Environmental Consulting, said her job requires her to take samples of rocks and soil from sites before testing them in a lab. “This helps me know if the rocks and soil material contain valuable minerals. “It enables me to write a report and draw geographical maps and models.” Reneilwe said her clients are government agencies and private companies. “I have more than 10 employees who’re environmental specialists. “They do environmental impact assessments and help our clients apply for environmental authorisation.” What she loves most about her job is doing research. “I review and learn every day,” she said. Reneilwe studied at the University of Venda and, during that time, visited various mines as part of her course programme. That’s when she fell in love with consulting.
