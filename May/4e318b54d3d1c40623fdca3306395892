Cape Town City have confirmed that goalkeeper Peter Leeuwenburgh has played his last game for the club and will return to the Netherlands before the end of the current 2020-21 DStv Premiership season. It was announced last month that the 27-year-old would join Dutch Eredivisie side Groningen for next season, but he has been released early from his contract in Cape Town with the side all but securing their top-eight place already. “Thanks for making me feel at home. The last three years have been an absolute pleasure,” Leeuwenburgh tweeted on Friday. “Life-changing moments on and off the pitch. Met so many special people from all kinds of cultures and backgrounds. More than ready for the next step.” The tall keeper made 90 appearances for the side over almost three seasons, and played a starring role when they lifted the MTN8 trophy in 2018. City must still face Black Leopards at home on Wednesday, as well as champions Mamelodi Sundowns away on 5 June. It is likely they will use Marc Anderson for those matches, who is the son of the former Bafana Bafana goalkeeper of the same name. -supersport.com
