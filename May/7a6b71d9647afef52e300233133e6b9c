He said he has thoroughly studied his opponent from Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila, and has learnt that he’s a good puncher who has vowed to knocked him out. “I’ve seen two videos of his fights and I think he’s a good fighter,” said Budler. “But I have my own way of operations and I’ll see on fight night how this will pan out in the ring.” Budler, who last fought against Hiroto Kyoguchi at Wynn Palace Cotai, Macao for the World Boxing Association Super World Light flyweight title two years ago, said he has been starved of fights. “The Covid-19 didn’t do justice to me, like anybody else,” said the Gauteng boxer better known as “The Hexecutioner”. “I’ve gone two and a half years without any fight and this has to be memorable. I’ve had about six fights that were cancelled. Remember this is money out of my pockets. “As a personal trainer, this is how I’ve been surviving. Me and my wife have put some funds aside so that we can survive throughout the time when I’m not fighting.” His last fight to be cancelled was TLB’s tournament in Secunda, where his challenger was found to be overweight and could not carry on with the fight. “That set me back, seriously,” said the man who boasts 35 knockouts and four defeats. “I had thoroughly prepared for that fight in Secunda and it saddened me that the first boxer who was scheduled to fight me missed a flight. And the second, who came on as substitute, was overweight and couldn’t lose to be in the required mass. I had to go back home without a fight.” Budler said he doesn’t want to boast that he will defeat Almacenat but admits that he has a very good record – seven wins, three defeats in a form of knockout and two draws. “You don’t just judge a boxer by the stats. He can come here and surprise me. But I’m ready for this fight.”
