THERE is no way that human body parts can ever make anyone successful. This was the serious warning from digital bones sangoma, Nzama Maluleke. SunReaders have raised concerns about the cruel acts of people who kill others with the hope of finding success. They said it appeared some people who wanted to grow their businesses killed innocent people to succeed. Nzama lashed out at those who encourage people to kill others for wealth. “Those are not izangoma and are tarnishing our image,” he said. He said a human head can’t make anyone rich. “If you want muthi that will help your business grow, go to a legitimate izangoma. “They’ll give you muthi that includes roots and animal oil.” He said when you gain wealth in the right way, you’ll enjoy your money. “Money obtained through human blood will never be enjoyed. “You will be haunted for the rest of your life. You will die and leave that wealth behind.” He said there are people who have all the money in the world but are unhappy. “Those are the things that trouble them. Get your wealth in a good way and live freely.” “’He said people should learn to work and hustle. “Some people turn to killing others for wealth because they want easy money and don’t want to work,” Nzama told Daily Sun. “SunReaders must report izangoma who participate in this evil practice.” Watch our Digital Sangoma every week at DAILYSUN.CO.ZA
