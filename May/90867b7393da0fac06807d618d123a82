AL Ahly are taking this weekend's Caf Champions League quarter-final clash against Mamelodi Sundowns very serious. The players and technical team were on Wednesday told to forget about everything, especially their 1-1 draw against Zamalek, and focus on the Sundowns match. The club's Director of Football, Sayed Abdel Hafiz, spoke to the players and technical team on Wednesday to be ready for this clash against Pitso Mosimane's former club at the Cairo Stadium on Saturday, 9pm. "Start strong, and (it's) very important phase, it begins by facing Sundowns on Saturday, the players must focus on it completely, and not think about any other matters except for this confrontation," the club said in a statement. They had a small group training to stretch legs at the Touch Stadium on Wednesday morning with the main training scheduled for Thursday. "(Abdel Hafiz) called on Mosimane's players to close the Premier League chapter (just for now), to focus on the Sundowns match in Cairo on Saturday evening." Mosimane on Wednesday held a "one-on-one motivational" session with players - Mohamed Hani and Akram Tawfiq - on the sidelines during their training session at the Touch Stadium, preparaing for Sundowns. "Mosimane's session with the duo was as they seek to give special instructions, (and) focus on the technical and moral aspects," club said on their official website. "The coach had held a meeting with the players before the start of training session to talk about their challenges and goals that the technical staff seeks to achieve, starting with Sundowns in Cairo."
