THEIR love has been burning like a wildfire for over 50 years! Madala Boy Molife (72) and his wife Nosakhele (66), who’re from Philippi in Cape Town, are their kasi’s favourite lovebirds. Gogo Nosakhele said their love is grounded in tradition and their ancestors accepted them as a couple. “We were married traditionally, so our marriage is blessed,” she said. Their love isn’t about money but a desire to be together forever. She said: “Nowadays girls look at your bank account. They agree to be with you if you have money. What happens when it runs out? “They’ll leave you for another man who has money. This is why marriages don’t last nowadays,” she said. They met while he was working in the mines in the former Transvaal in 1971. “He’d come back once or twice a year but I never cheated on him. We got married in 1979 and moved from the Eastern Cape to Cape Town in 1982,” she said. Madala said: “She was a young girl who wanted to start a family and nothing else. She didn’t look at what I had. “I left whatever I bought before I got married at home and we started everything afresh.” When Aids started in the ‘80s they vowed to remain faithful. “It was a scary and we agreed it would never kill us,” she said. Said gogo: “We didn’t have a TV back then. When the sun set we cooked, ate and made babies.” Resident Zizipho Mnyameni(48) said: “They’re always together, sometimes holding hands. They look very happy, almost as if they’re young lovers who’ve just gotten married.” Boy and Nosakhele have four boys and two girls.
