NEWS reaching SunSport is that Bloemfontein Celtic players have threatened to boycott Monday afternoon’s training session, unless chairman Max Tshabalala pays them their outstanding bonuses. The Siwelele salary saga has raised its ugly head again as management and technical staff members are rumoured to have not been paid for April. As if that was not enough, players are also on the same boat as they demand their outstanding win bonuses owed to them since last year, SunSport has been reliably told. The players were promised to be paid their bonus last Thursday after they almost went on strike a fortnight ago. However, management made a U-turn last Wednesday when the club’s General Manager Sainty Molali sent a letter to players informing them about further delays to pay them due to strikes in Mangaung. “Kindly take note that bonuses will be paid later than initially agreed. The delay has been caused by the shut down strikes in and around Mangaung that has disrupted normal operations in different government offices, hence we could not be paid this week. Please note that bonuses will be paid immediately upon receipt of payment which could be sometimes next week,” read the letter that SunSport has seen. However, players seem to have had enough now on what they say are empty promises.
