ORLANDO Pirates are hoping to restore their pride at the expense of bottom club Black Leopards. The teams will battle it out in a DStv Premiership match at Orlando Stadium on Thursday (5pm). Pirates are still reeling from a shocking 3-0 league defeat to log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns at the same venue on Sunday. This will be an interesting clash considering that Bucs are aiming for revenge having lost 2-0 to Leopards in the first round match played in Thohoyandou. Pirates have enjoyed dominance over the Limpopo side, having beaten them eight times compared to just one win for Lehlohonolo Seema’s coached side. Pirates are also eyeing qualification for next year’s Caf Champions League. On the other hand, Leopards are desperate for points in a bid to avoid the relegation axe hovering above their heads. Bucs occupy fifth spot on the league table on 39 points from 24 matches, and are 13 points behind the Brazilians. Leopards are six points behind second bottom Chippa United, who are one point behind third bottom Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). Seema has been working hard trying to find different winning combinations to ensure they retain their PSL status. Seema believes their win over fellow Limpopo rivals TTM is a step in the right direction and will motivate his charges to fight for maximum points in their remaining games. “We haven’t moved. We’re still bottom of the log, but this win is a step in the right direction. All our remaining games are like a cup final now. We have five games left, meaning there’s still 15 points to fight for, so we will take each game as it comes.” Leopards will pin their hopes on the shoulders of veteran strikers Ovidy Karuru and Rodney Ramagalela to upset Bucs. But Pirates are also expected to bring their A game to avoid more slip ups, with winger Deon Hotto and striker Gabadinho Mhango holding the key to unlock the Lidoda Duvha defence today.
