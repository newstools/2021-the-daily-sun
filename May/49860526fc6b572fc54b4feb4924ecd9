PETER Shalulile’s first-half goal was enough to separate Mamelodi Sundowns with TS Galaxy in their DStv Premiership fixture at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday. The win, their 16th of the season, edged closer to clinching their fourth consecutive title and preserved their unbeaten record away from home so far. The depth in Manqoba Mngqithi’s squad is starting to prove the difference as the Sundowns coach has afforded to change his squad without breaking momentum, although his team suffered a slump recently.     "We do as the coaches say. We've been here before and we know what it takes. We have to focus," said man of the match Andile Jali afterwards.  Far away in the lowveld, Masandawana barely raised a sweat to see off the Rockets as Shalulile headed in from a poor clearance.  Galaxy created very few clear-cut chances and even missed a penalty, Kennedy Mweene denying Lindokuhle Mbatha in the first half.  Not for the first time this season, Mosa Lebusa conceded a penalty, this time blocking a shot with his arm. But he had a huge sigh of relief as Mweene parried.  Masilake Mphohlongo messed up a last-minute opportunity to secure a point. But that wouldn’t have been a fair result, given Sundowns’ dominance.  The Rockets are in eighth spot on 29 points and will need to improve in their next remaining to secure their spot.
