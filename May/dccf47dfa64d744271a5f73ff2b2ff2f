FOUR ANC members were on their way to a ward meeting when three attackers jumped out of the bushes and shot at them. Councillor Bhunu Malandule (43) and three others escaped death in the ambush near Mkhuhlu, outside Hazyview in Mpumalanga. His bakkie was riddled with bullets before the shooters fled in a car. He and Rachim Mathebula (50), Jonas Mbewe (48) and Tutu Mkhatshwa (40) were driving towards a bridge when the attack took place. “The first bullet hit the windscreen and went through the passenger door window. The second hit above the driver’s door,” he said.  He said before the attackers jumped into their car and drove off, one said, “Ihambile lenja”. “There were many cars on the road and none of them were attacked,” said Malandule. ALSO READ:
