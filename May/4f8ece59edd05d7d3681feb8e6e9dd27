THE Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in KZN has announced that it has expelled the mayor of Melmoth north of KZN under Mthonjaneni local municipality and four other councillors. It's not yet clear what exactly the five did to be expelled, as the party said it's expelling them after they were found guilty of conduct inconsistent. In a statement released by the party's spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa it states that this afternoon the National Council met in terms of section 11.10 of the IFP Constitution and has unanimously resolved to expel from the Party the following councillors of Mthonjaneni Local municipality in Melmoth with immediate effect. The expelled councillors are the mayor Sibonginkosi Biyela, Eric Masikane, Tholinhlanhla Ngema, Zipho Ndlovu and Nhlonipho Buthelezi. Hlengwa said the above have been found guilty of conduct inconsistent with the IFP Constitution and were in defiance of Party instructions. "Accordingly, the above individuals are no longer IFP Councillors and the affected municipality has been informed of this decision," said Hlengwa. Hlengwa said the IFP will make announcements with regards to the filling of the mayoral vacancy in due course.
