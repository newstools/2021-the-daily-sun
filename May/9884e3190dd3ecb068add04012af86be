RESIDENTS of this area don’t feel free in their own homes. The people of Victoria Mxenge in Philippi, Browns Farm, Cape Town are being terrorised by big rats almost every day. Nokangela Roji (66) said: “These rats are terrorising us. You’d swear we don’t own these houses.” She said the rats not only ate their groceries, but their dustbins as well. Nokangela said the city should help them with anything that will kill the big rats. She said the rats were caused by blocked drains. “The city knows about the drains. It’s been two years since we reported the blockage, but nothing happened. “We believe the rats will go away if they fix the drains,” she said. Pat Matholengwe (66) said the rats will give them diseases. She said the rats sometimes disturbed them most during meal times. “We’re experiencing these issues because we’re surrounded by kak.” MMC for Community Services and Health Zahid Badroodien said environmental health department has not received any complaints about rats in this area. “Now that we’re aware of the concerns, the area environmental health practitioner will engage the community,” said Badroodien.
