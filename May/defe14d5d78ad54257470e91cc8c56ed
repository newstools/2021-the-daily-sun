THE ANC Women’s League picketed outside the Palestinian embassy in Tshwane on Thursday, 27 May. In solidarity with the people of Palestine, the league held its weekly Umanyano programme in support of Palestinian women in their quest for freedom and land. In her message, league president Bathabile Dlamini said Israel must stop killing Palestinians. She said the world supported South Africa during the struggle. “The international solidarity will sustain us to fight our problems,” she said. She said the international community must stop the bombings and killings of innocent people. Dlamini said no one will threaten the ambassador of Palestine in South Africa. “There’s no war in Palestine. Israeli soldiers, armed to the teeth, are killing innocent Palestinians and no one must tolerate thatWe must silence Israeli guns in the Middle East,” she said. ANC head of organising and NEC member Nomvula Mokonyane said: “We thank the Women’s League for their initiative as part of rolling mass action all over South Africa. Let’s stop buying food from Israel and stop doing business with them.”  Mokonyane said they will give a full list on Saturday of the Israeli goods which will be boycotted. “Those goods are dripping with the blood of innocent children,” she said. African Parliament and Saharawi Women’s League member Mariem Mohamedu said: “In solidarity with Palestine, we are here to tell Israel to stop killing innocent people.” Hassona Aldramly, a councillor in the Palestine embassy, said: “This is an amazing day of support by South Africans. “We’re honoured and privileged to be supported in this manner.  “My message to the Israel government is: Jerusalem is our capital and stop killing our people.” Palestine’s ambassador to South Africa, Hanan Jarrar, was one of the dignitaries at the picket.
