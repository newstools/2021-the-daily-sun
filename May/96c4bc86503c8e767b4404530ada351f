WITH the fast-growing natural hair movement across the globe, more African women are showing up with Afros, kinks and coils. They are embracing their roots and many are starting their own authentic hair brands. Gontse Kgokolo, who started her African hair brand Kwanele SA in 2019 after struggling with her Afro, told SunBuzz how her struggles turned into a booming business. “Hair struggles are real, and we realised that the market had hair oils but no electronic appliances and products that catered for kinky and curly African hair,” Gontse said. For years, she had relaxed hair, and in 2012 she decided to cut it to start afresh. “Little did I know that maintaining an Afro would be so much work. I never had time to really sit and work on my hair because I was a new mum. I struggled to maintain the Afro and one day I got an idea to try and get a brush that was electric and could cut out the blow-drying,” she said. ALSO READ | THANDY HERE FOR BLACK TAX! The businesswoman (32) bought over 100 brushes with her retirement package to start her brand. “I tested every brush that was on the market until I found what was perfect for women with my hair type. Now we have what we call the Kwanele Wide Comb Afro Hair Straightening Brush. It gives Afros the right stretch with no damage. It’s designed to be painless and has minimal breakage when being used, which makes it suitable for both kids and adults,” she said. Among other products, such as heat protectants and hair extensions, the brush is made especially for African hair textures. The Tshwane-based businesswoman said it’s time the hair industry catered to all African hair types.
