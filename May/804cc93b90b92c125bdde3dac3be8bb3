"There is nothing that can really prepare you 100% for
a situation like that," is what Leo Prinsloo said after surviving a cash-in-transit
(CIT) attack in Pretoria last week. Prinsloo spoke to television broadcasting channel eNCA's
reporter, Barry Bateman, saying he "pre-visualised" what he was going
to do when a group of armed men tried to rob the CIT vehicle he was driving on
22 April, on the N4 in Pretoria. News24 reported police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo as
saying the attackers fired several shots at the vehicle, attempting to stop it
during a high speed chase. The footage, which was recorded in the cabin of the CIT
vehicle, shows Prinsloo and his colleague, Lloyd Mtombeni, reacting to multiple
shots. According to Batemen, Mtombeni said it was his fourth day at
the company and his third day assigned under Prinsloo when the incident
occurred. "You know instinct kicks in pretty much... When we
train people, we usually tell them to pre-visualise what you are going to do...
That's pretty much what happened - I pre-visualised what I was going to do, to
the best of my ability," said Prinsloo. I did what my mind just told me to do, and it worked out for
me on that day.  As the armed robbers pounced, Prinsloo could be seen
immediately reacting, appearing to ram into one of the vehicles before speeding
off. He is seen in the footage, cool, calm and collected. He asks
Mtombeni to cock a rifle, as he evades the CIT robbers. He makes a U-turn and
then speeds off again. Mtombeni said it was his first time being shot at, but he
was comforted knowing he was under the care of the experienced Prinsloo. "I learnt a lot - how to react to situations like
[that]... Because it was my first time..." The attackers fled without taking any cash. Naidoo said no arrests had been made yet. SOURCE: NEWS24
