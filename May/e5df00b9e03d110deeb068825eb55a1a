THERE’S a big stigma around fertility treatment in some parts of society. And this leaves a number of women ashamed to seek treatment. Catherine Cokoto (43) from Buccleuch, north of Joburg, founded Hanna’s Grace, a ministry that supports women going through infertility. She said her personal challenges led her to start the ministry. “I experienced infertility for seven years in my marriage. I was referred from one doctor to another until I lost faith. But in my seventh year, I was blessed with a baby boy like Sarah, Rebecca, Rachael, Hannah and Elizabeth, who encountered the same problem as me.” Catherine said they have a private support group on Facebook with more than 1 200 members. “We offer prayer and resident doctors who give medical advice. We bring awareness on how to support women who’re going through infertility,” she said. Catherine emphasised that Mother’s Day celebrations, pregnancy announcements and baby showers were difficult for women with fertility challenges. “Mother’s Day is the worst in church. It’s a sad reminder that one is not a mother. Every activity of the day is all about mothers,” Catherine told Daily Sun. When Catherine is not running her ministry, she’s a full-time medical technologist who works as a clinic lab interface officer. She ensures that samples that are collected at clinics are in good quality, so that they’re not rejected. Hanna’s Grace will host a robust talk with Thobile Makhumalo Mseleku of Uthando Nesthembu fame via Zoom on Saturday, 8 May between 4pm and 6pm.
