GIVING the less fortunate hope and uplifting his community is at the top of Vusi Mabaso’s agenda. The 37-year-old from Dannhauser in Newcastle, KZN, is running to be a councillor in his region. He told Daily Sun that he developed passion for politics after he lost his parents when he was only 14. The support he got from the ANC led him to becoming a volunteer at 17. “I joined the youth league in 2011 and in 2015, I was elected as branch chairman. In 2017 the mother body made me chairman and under my leadership, we built two houses for families in need. “I was helped by a kind businessman who grew up in that area, and couldn’t bare to see children suffer because their parents couldn’t build them a decent home,” said Mabaso. Because he was elected twice, Mabaso was still the branch chairman the community looked up to. “There’s a lot of poverty and unemployment in my region. People are suffering. I’m not saying I can perform miracles, but I know we can take this community to new heights if we work together. It’s heartbreaking to see people sleep on an empty stomach.” He said he also wanted to restore people’s faith in the organisation by earning their trust back and delivering on what was once promised. Prominent businessman Teddy Nyathi from Kwamdakane in Newcastle met Mabaso 20 years ago, and was drawn to his hunger for revolution. “I noticed how he challenged leaders who weren’t delivering services and the influence he had around the community. “He has always been a hard worker and selfless. He once sacrificed his own meal to share with someone who didn’t have food. I believe that’s what a great leader does,” said Nyathi.
