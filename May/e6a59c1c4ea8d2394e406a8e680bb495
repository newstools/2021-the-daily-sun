Footballers love cars, and that is no secret. And with the amount of money they rake in, they can afford to drive the best cars out there. But they do not always have to pay big bucks to get behind the wheel of their dream cars. Through sponsorships, footballer are able to drive some of the best cars for free. And this was the case for Mamelodi Sundowns' George Maluleka. The midfielder recently got behind the wheel of a luxury SUV that is priced from the R769 500. This was at the launch of the new Hyundai Santa Fe. Sundowns enjoy a sponsorship with the Korean vehicle brand. Maluleka, who has a thing for big cars, was delighted to get the opportunity to get behind the wheel the luxury SUV. "I just have a weakness for big cars," he wrote on social media. "I love this new one from Hyundai. The New Santa Fe. I love it."
