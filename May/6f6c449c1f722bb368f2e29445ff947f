THE African National Congress will be opposing the suspended
Secretary General Ace Magashule’s court bid to have his suspension overturned. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said in a brief statement, “The
ANC National Officials met today (Monday) and affirmed the decision to oppose
the application lodged by the Secretary General Comrade Ace Magashule to have,
among others, his temporary suspension lifted. “The ANC has appointed Ledwaba Mazwai Attorneys as
instructing attorneys supported by the following three senior counsels and one
junior counsel.” Magashule approached the courts few days before his deadline
to publicly apologise for attempting to suspend the ANC the President, Cyril
Ramaphosa. Daily Sun previously reported, in the court papers, which
surfaced on Friday 14 May, Magashule said he wants the Johannesburg High Court
to hear his case on an urgent basis. He wants the court on 1 June to declare that the ANC’s step
aside rule to be unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid. In turn, Magashule also wants his suspension of Ramaphosa to
be declared valid. Ramaphosa briefed the media on Monday, 10 May, about the
decisions taken by the NEC on a variety of issues that included the step-aside
resolution that led to Magashule being temporarily suspended.
