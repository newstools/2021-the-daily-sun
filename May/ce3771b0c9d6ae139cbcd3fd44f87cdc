TEACHERS at Buyani Primary School in Finetown south of Joburg fear for their pupils’ safety, as well as their own. This as there are exposed izinyoka cables in the classrooms, allegedly left so during maintenance work. According to teachers, the school’s power supply has been unstable for years. They claimed one of the reasons could be that it was connected illegally to the grid. One teacher said they were visited by Eskom at one point over non-payment and the deputy principal addressed the issue. “The deputy paid up. The school hires its own people (to fix the probem) because when they fix it today, the power is out again tomorrow.” Although there have been no injuries, the concern remains. “As a teacher, I am also here to protect the kids. I get worried when I see them exposed to danger,” said the teacher. She said it would be great if the school was inspected.  “We have written to the department about so many issues.” Another teacher told the People’s Paper electricians worked there during lessons. “I wondered whether I should run away or get the kids, should there be an explosion.” She said in one of the classes, a circuit box was left opened and they were concerned pupils would tamper with the cables. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona told Daily Sun they were aware of the electricity challenges at the school. “Some community members are illegally connecting electricity from the school to different households. We condemn this practice and urge them to stop the illegal connections.” Mabona denied that the school was illegally connecting to the grid.
