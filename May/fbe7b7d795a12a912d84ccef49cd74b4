Wydad Casablanca secured a 1-0 win over MC Alger in the Caf Champions League quarter-final second-leg match at the Stade Mohamed V in Morocco on Saturday night. The result saw Wydad advance to the semifinals after defeating Algerian side Alger 2-1 on aggregate following a 1-1 draw in the first-leg clash in Algiers. The Moroccan giants will face Kaizer Chiefs in the last four next month after the Amakhosi eliminated Tanzanian champions Simba SC in a quarterfinal tie. The Red Castle began the game brightly and they applied some pressure on the Dean, but the hosts were let down by some poor finishing. Aymane Hassouni's effort was well saved by Alger goalkeeper Ahmed Boutagga after the Wydad midfielder was allowed some space and time to shoot. Ayoub El Kaabi also had a chance to put Wydad in the lead, but the 27-year-old forward failed to keep his attempt on target and the score was 0-0 at the interval. The Dean did not adopt a defensive approach after the restart as they pushed forward in search of the opening goal of the encounter. Midfielders Mehdi Benaldjia and Abderrahmane Bourdim were both introduced in the 66th minute by Alger head coach Nabil Neghiz as the visitors looked to control the game. The Red Castle surged forward in numbers in the closing stages as they looked to snatch a late winning goal. They did get the goal they had been looking for in stoppage time as Walid El Karti hit the back of the net to hand Wydad a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Alger. -SuperSport
