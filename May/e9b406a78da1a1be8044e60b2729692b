The two, aged 28 and 35, were arrested on Monday after police received a tip-off that abalone was being transported. "The duo was arrested… after members of the Hawks' Serious Organised Crime Investigation, Crime Intelligence and officials from the Department of Environmental, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) reacted on information concerning the transportation of illegal abalone (sic)," Hawks spokesperson Zinzi Hani said.
