HER husband drowned in a park near their home on Friday. Now she believes his death was caused by his refusal to accept intwaso. Thobeka Cumse said she was not home when the incident happened. She said neighbours told her that her husband, Rooi-Jan (56) was trying to get a neighbour’s ball from the water when he drowned. “He got the ball, but dropped it as he was about to get out of the water. He went back to fetch it and drowned. Neighbours tried to rescue him, but couldn’t.” The 55-year-old from Ngunguluza in Kariega, Eastern Cape said before cop divers retrieved her husband’s body, the electricity went off as the reverend tried to read a Bible verse. “We tried to use paraffin lamps, but all of them went dim. I immediately knew it was a sign that his death had to do with his calling.” Thobeka said whenever Rooi-Jan crossed the park, he rubbed mud on his forehead and asked the ancestors to grant him permission to pass.  “I couldn’t believe he risked his life to get the ball. In the past he refused to save people. In 2017 a woman ran into the water and nearly drowned. But he never saved her. He said it was a sacred place and he was scared of water.” Thobeka said in 2018 her husband developed white skin pigments around his eyes and legs. “While at work in 2019, he found a bag full of beads and a spear. “He took the bag but his colleagues told him to take it back to the river if he did not want to get into trouble. He knew very well it was a message from his ancestors.” Sangoma Thobelithongo Ncaminkosi said Rooi-Jan drowned because his ancestors were angry. “They gave him all the signs to accept the calling, but he ignored them,” said Ncaminkosi. Captain Gerda Swart said an inquest docket has been opened.
