THE struggle for a top-eight is fast turning into a scramble to avoid a possible relegation dogfight for Kaizer Chiefs. A 2-1 DStv Premiership defeat to Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium has now left Amakhosi in danger of not qualifying for the top-eight. Two goals from Tiklas Thutlwa in either half ensured the home side a vital rare victory. As they so often do, Chiefs were the first on the scoreline, this time getting an early breakthrough through Leonardo Castro on the 11th minute. They are 11th with 30 points on the log – three away from the top-eight bracket, and a defeat away from the relegation red zone.Leopards held on for a massive win, which gave them a chance to fight another day in the PSL. Jonas Mendes pulled off arguably the biggest save since he joined Leopards to deny Sabelo Radebe at the death.At the other end, Themba Ndlovu messed a chance to seal it at the end. But Leopards had already made their intensions very clear, moving to 22 points.They will be hoping their nearest rivals Chippa United drop points in their next outing. Such eventuality will leave the two bottom sides to battle it out for a spot in the play-off.In his 900th match as coach, Gavin Hunt could not celebrate his milestone with victory as his men let him down, yet again. Two decades ago, Hunt arrived in Thohoyandou to take charge of Leopards and gained prominence as a coach. Yesterday, he looked forlornly on the touchline as his former side frustrated him. Thutlwa tapped in the equaliser in the 44th minute, connecting with a low cross.He headed in the winner shortly after the hour mark and secured a crucial win for Leopards. They live to fight another day. Reacted Hunt after the match: “We didn’t defend well at all hence they got the second goal. We had a couple chances to win the match but we didn’t take them. We have two more games and we have to keep going. We have to be ready for next coming matches.”
