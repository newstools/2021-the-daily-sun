South Africa Under-23 National team coach David Notoane is intensifying preparations for his side as they look to sharpen their tools for the  Tokyo Olympic Games. The 52-year-old mentor has named a 25-member squad that will take part in a tournament in the United Arab Emirates against Brazil, Korea and Argentina. The tournament, which will be part of the u23's preparations for the rescheduled Tokyo Olympic Games, will take place from 5-11 June 2021 in the UAE. Notoane is hoping that the their participation in the tournament will take them a step closer to being ready for the end game, the Olympic Games set to take centre stage from 22 July-8 August 2021. Mzansi will be in Group alongside hosts Japan, France and Mexico. They get their campaign up and running with a clash against the hosts on 22 July at the Tokyo Stadium before facing France at Saitama Stadium on 25 July. Notoane’s side then round off their group stage matches against Mexico at the Sapporo Dome on July 28. Notoane is looking to use the tournament in UAE to find the right combinations and build some momentum heading into the Olympic Gmaes. He believes it will also be an ideal opportunity to integrate his  foreign based players into the squad. “The upcoming camp in Dubai is one that kick-starts our preparations for the Olympic Games. It is also aimed at integrating our foreign based players to see what they can bring into the group in terms of increasing the team quality and addressing key challenging positions,” said Notoane. “We hope that we can get all the players that we require to integrate them during this vital preparation camp against Brazil, Korea and Argentina.  It will also give us a good measure in terms of the level of our players’ state of preparedness for the Tokyo Olympics later in July."
