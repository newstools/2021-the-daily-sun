AMAZULU have a chance to go top of the DStv Premiership table tomorrow when they visit neighbours Golden Arrows in their league match at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium (3pm). But they must blunt the stubborn Arrows in their KZN derby. AmaZulu are breathing heavily behind the neck of log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, who are stuttering of late, and they visit another inconsistent Orlando Pirates in Orlando on Sunday. McCarthy’s side second with 47 points after 25 games, one point behind the Brazilians, who still have two games in hand. Usuthu must be confident that they can momentarily depose Sundowns from the summit for the first time this season and go top – they remain unbeaten in 15 league matches, a record for the club. On the other hand, Downs have failed to win in their last four matches in all competitions. As Sundowns face Pirates in Soweto, Bucs have not lost in almost three years in their backyard, which is 38 games now. In fact, Josef Zinnbauer has not lost a league match at Orlando Stadium since he was appointed by Pirates in December 2019. When this was put to coach Benni McCarthy yesterday that Usuthu have a chance to go top, the all-time Bafana Bafana scorer said he has not given it a thought. “The match between Pirates and Sundowns, I’m not interested in that,” said McCarthy, whose side go to this fixture after beating Cape Town City 5-1 on Wednesday. “Our focus is on Golden Arrows and I’m sure coach Mandla Ncikazi and his troops will be well-prepared, but so are we.” However, Arrows have not won at home in their four matches since beating Pirates in February. But Ncikazi is reading too little into his team’s home stats. “We want to finish in the highest position that Arrows have never finished before,” said Ncikazi. When these two sides met in the reverse fixture, Arrows beat Usuthu 2-0 in Durban last year, in which McCarthy was on the stands as he was just appointed a few days ago.
