WHILE everybody was celebrating Mother’s Day, internationally acclaimed playwright, director, actor and producer Tyler Perry revealed that he had never been to her mum’s grave. This because he felt no need as he did everything he could while she was still alive. Taking to his Facebook page, he wrote: “Since my mother’s gravestone was placed, I’ve never been back to her grave. I’ve never even sent flowers to it. It’s been almost 12 years now, and I haven’t done it once. I know we all have our own way of coping and grieving, but for me, I can honestly say in my heart of hearts that I don’t feel the need to because I did everything I could for her when she was alive. I showered her with love, took care of and gave her flowers while she was alive. So to all of you who have mothers on the top side of the soil, it’s my hope that you will feel the same sense of peace that I have when that time comes. It’s my hope that you and she both know you’ve done all you could for her and all you could to celebrate her, while letting her know that she is loved.” ASLO READ |MERCY WANTS AN END TO CASE Celebrity Somizi Mhlongo shared the same sentiments with Tyler. He wrote on his Instagram page that he felt content with late mum. “For some reason, I thought I’d wake up with a heavy heart today because it’s the first Mother’s Day without my mum. I woke up feeling the complete opposite, and I know exactly why. My mom never left me. I feel her presence everyday. It’s such an amazing feeling. Happy Mother’s Day to all the mamas. They never leave.” The post was accompanied by an emotional video clip of a pair of sneakers engraved with his mum’s picture.
