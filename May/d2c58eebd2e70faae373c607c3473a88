LEADERS of the Zion Christian Church received their Covid-19 jabs on Friday, 21 May. His Grace the Right’s reverend, Bishop Dr Barnabas Lekaganyane as well as his wife Evelyn and ZCC St Engenas’ Bishop Dr Joseph Lekganyane were vaccinated at the Petersburg Hospital in Polokwane by the Limpopo Health MEC, Dr Phophi Ramathuba. Both the churches, which are attended by millions of people in Mzansi and across the world, are still closed in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. Ramathuba said she was humbled by the support and understanding the two churches were giving the government in the fight against the pandemic. She said the phase 2 roll-out is aimed at protecting the population against the SARS-Cov-2 virus, by interrupting transmission through achievement of herd immunity and reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by the virus.  “We encourage all eligible vaccine recipients to register for vaccines through the Electronic Vaccination Delivery System (EVDS). “Vaccine recipients will be able to access the service at their nearest accredited vaccination centre with no payment,” said Ramathuba. She said the registration process will require all of us to work together to ensure the success of the Covid-19 vaccination roll out. “Only those who have registered will be vaccinated. To avoid overcrowding, long queues and risks of spreading Covid-19, we must wait to be invited by the Department of Health through an SMS to go and receive your vaccine,” she said.
