RAPPER Big Zulu is lending a helping hand to fight poverty. The Imali Eningi hitmaker has started an initiative called Inhlupheko Singayinqoba, where he buys clothes and groceries for people from poor families. Big Zulu has since helped two families and said he was looking forward to helping more people. He shared his good deeds on YouTube. Big Zulu told Daily Sun that the initiative was inspired by his song, Inhlupheko featuring Mduduzi, which he dropped in March. “When I wrote that song, I was looking at situations that black people go through and saw that doing the song alone is not enough. “I decided to help families that need help because I have a bit to share,” he told the People’s Paper. Big Zulu said he helped people from all over the country.

The rapper, who has been doing everything from his own pocket, said he didn’t have a limit to how many people he’ll help. “The aim is to try to end poverty. I’ll do everything I can as long as I still can. “I try to do this every month, and sometimes it’s twice in a month,” he said. “I’m doing everything by myself. “Sometimes Spitz helps because I’m their brand ambassador. That’s why I also gift them with shoes from Spitz. “But I do most of the things myself through my label, Inkabi Records.” Big Zulu said he hoped to motivate and encourage people to help others where they can. “I want to call on everyone who can help to do so. My dream is to see people making a difference and helping those in need,” he said.
