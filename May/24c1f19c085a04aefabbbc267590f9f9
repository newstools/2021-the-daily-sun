HE dresses to impress and his hair creations are out of this world. Hairstylist Beekay Mafora (45) from Sebokeng in the Vaal, who always dresses in a suit and tie, has been a lover of hair and fashion for as long as he can remember. “Passion and love for doing hair is what hooked me to being a hairdresser,” he told Daily Sun. “But this is a business and not a hobby, and money is what keeps me working on perfecting my craft.” Beekay said the looks of amazement on clients’ faces make his day. “I love the reaction I get from people when I’m done with their hair,” he said. “The smile of disbelief, and how people look when they get what they wanted, keeps me going. “Changing somebody’s image pleases me. “Hair and fashion go together. The way you see me in the first five seconds is what you remember. “Presentation is what makes people trust me with their hair.” Beekay has worked with various hair types and is the most trusted stylist or barber ekasi. Dozens flock to his Fountain of Beauty hair salon and leave with smiles on their faces. Hilda Zwane said she’d been with Beekay for three years. “His salon closes late and his work is stunning. “What I love is that each time I fix my hair my colleagues ask where I did it and what the style is called. “His service is exceptional and his hairdos to die for.”
