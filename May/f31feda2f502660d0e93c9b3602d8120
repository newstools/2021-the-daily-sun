I OFTEN hear through the grapevine how inseparable women and their wine are. This match made in winery heaven seems to have the right ingredients for #relationshipgoals. So, what makes this relationship special? According to experts, there are a lot of similarities between the punani and wine. Besides both of them ageing well, there’s more that these two have in common. According to Medical News Today, the normal pH (the acidity or alkalinity of a solution on a logarithmic scale on which seven is neutral, lower values are more acidic and higher values more alkaline) of the vagina is less than 4,5, which is similar to the pH of wine. According to experts, there’s good bacteria called lactobacilli. UMJOLO GOT HIM MOERED! Lactobacilli are the good bacteria that dominate the punani. They help to keep pH levels normal in the lady parts and prevent the growth of infection-causing bacteria. When levels of lactobacilli fall, vaginal pH levels can rise above 4,5, which is ideal breeding ground for vaginal infections, such as yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis. As the Cleopatra publication beautifully puts it: “Her vagina is like a glass of wine.”
