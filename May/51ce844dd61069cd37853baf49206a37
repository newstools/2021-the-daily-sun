A 17-YEAR-old pupil from Mpumalanga who is accused of killing another pupil by hitting him with a brick pleaded guilty on Friday, 14 May. He appeared before the Mhala Regional Court where Magistrate Elmarie Theron postponed the matter until 11 June for a pre-sentencing report by social workers. The boy allegedly hit the other pupil over a dice game in February, leaving him for dead in a pool of blood. Mashego was certified dead shortly after his arrival at a nearby clinic. His brutal killing left his fellow pupils and teachers scared and traumatised. Education MEC Bonakele Majuba, Mpumalanga police who were led by provincial spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi as well as Bushbuckridge Police Station commander Colonel Nokuthula Mayindi and social workers visited the school to offer counselling and moral support to the pupils. Meanwhile, a boy (19) and his co-accused (18) are due to reappear before the court on Monday, 18 May, for trial. Both are facing a count of murder after they allegedly stabbed another pupil to death with a knife at school in 2019. Both boys are out on R1000 bail each.
