FORMER Transnet CFO Anoj Singh has told the Zondo Commission the company had no capacity to deal with the transaction of 1 064 locomotives. He said this was the reason he decided to bring in Gupta-linked company, Regiments, to help with the trains procurement with initial estimated cost of R38,6 billion which escalated to R54 billion. He told the commission on Thursday, 27 May, that Transnet treasury only had the capacity to manage the day-to-day funding plan and not the bigger projects such as the locomotives. He said internal treasury could not add the value that Regiments added. He said in fact Transnet had engaged China development bank to get a loan but the engagements broke down and that’s when he brought in Regiments. Singh said, however, Regiments kept Transnet informed about every development in the transaction.

The contract was concluded in 2014 by Transnet with Original Equipment Manufacturers to buy the 1 064 locomotives. Singh said it was not as if Regiments was doing its own thing without interaction with Transnet. Former Transnet group treasurer Mathane Makgatho alleged at the commission that the contracts were negotiated by outsiders and internal treasury was bypassed. She also claimed Singh excluded her from accessing the data room. Singh denied Makgatho’s allegations and said, in her own version, she told the inquiry she was a member of a cross-functional team which meant that she had all the rights to access the data room and get any information she wanted. He said, anyway, the data room was not under his control. “I had no oversight over that data room,” said Singh.
