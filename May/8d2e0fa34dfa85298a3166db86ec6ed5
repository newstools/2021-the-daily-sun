KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt admitted that it was frustrating that they cannot maintain consistency. It is no secret that the 2020-21 season has been the worst for Amakhosi, despite their fairy-tale Caf Champions League run. On Saturday, they will be hoping for a positive result when they host Tanzanian giants Simba SC in their Champions League quarterfinal tie at FNB Stadium on Saturday night (6pm). “It’s a bit frustrating because you want to have consistency in all competitions, and we seem to have played our best football in the Champions League,” Hunt told reporters in his pre-match press briefing. “But, you know, we’ve played a lot of games, extra games as well, and we’ve played really well. It’s hard to put your finger on it but, as I have said, if it was the other way around then we would be top of the league, but it has not been and we have just got to try and put that out of our minds and concentrate on tomorrow’s game.” Hunt, however, said that they had enough time to prepare for a good showing on the day. “We had enough time to prepare. We are looking forward to the game everyone is raring to go, we have worked hard to get to this point of the tournament,” he said. “Everybody is committed‚ and that's all we can promise. And we will give a good‚ committed performance‚ that's all.” Chiefs have not been consistent this season in the DStv Premiership. However, they have been impressive on the continent. Hunt said they would love to have consistency in all competitions. On their way to the quarterfinals, Simba, who will also be playing in this stage of the tournament for the first time, defeated Al Ahly and Hunt is aware of what to expect from them. He added: “They (Simba) are a solid typical African team. We know it will be a tough game for us.” The return leg of this encounter is scheduled for next Saturday in Tanzania.
