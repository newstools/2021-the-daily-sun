A LEARNER driver was bust for fraud after being caught with an exam script note and R2 000 in his sleeve during an exam in Cape Town. MMC for Safety and Security JP Smith said the incident happened last Friday. “On Friday, 21 May, a learner licence applicant was arrested for cheating on his test. He was found in possession of a script note under his sleeve and R2 000 cash, which he admitted was going to pay the person who gave him the note. The applicant was arrested on a charge of fraud,” he said. Last month a 33-year-old applicant was bust after he attempted to bribe an examiner after he failed his test. According to Smith, the driver offered R1 500 to the examiner at Milnerton Driving Licence Centre in an attempt to have his fail changed to a pass. Smith said the man had thrown himself in hot water. “Instead of simply having to deal with a delay in obtaining a learner licence through correct channels, this gentlemen now faces the prospect of a criminal record.” Meanwhile, last month Augustine Mramba, a driving school instructor from Rasta Driving School, was handed a five-year sentence by Vredenburg Regional Court for corruption. He was arrested together with traffic cop Riaan Wiid from Matzikama Municipality on 9 March 2018. According to Hawks spokesperson Zinzi Hani, the two were arrested on allegations of corruption involving the selling of driving licences. Code 10 driving licences were being sold for a minimum of R2 000.
