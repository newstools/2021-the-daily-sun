A CHEVROLET Malibu crashed and landed on top of a roof. The incident happened in St. Louis, Missouri, on Sunday morning. The white Chevrolet Malibu was driven down The Legends Parkway in Eureka, St. Louis, when it sped off the road and slammed into a pine tree. The car then started to flip on an embankment before slamming through an iron fence, flying and smashing nose-first into the roof of the house. “If you look at that crash it’s like: how did somebody not die?” fire department spokesman Scott Barthelmass told Carscoops. According to Carscoops, a couple was sleeping inside the house just a few metres from where the car crashed into the property. Strangely, they avoided injury together with the two teenagers inside the car.
