THE minute tjotjo prosecutor Dumisa Kumbaca’s case was transferred, he surprised the magistrate by asking for another bail application. Kumbaca told Magistrate Annemarie Elliot in the East London Magistrates Court that he had new evidence. His case was transferred to East London Regional Court for 4 June for a trial date. In February, Kumbaca was denied bail because it was not in the interest of justice to release him. In court on Wednesday, 12 May, Kumbaca said he wanted to reapply. He said he had dumped his legal team – which he had now done twice. He dumped Bongani Macingwane on 20 April, and now Rodney Matshaya, telling the magistrate that he’d be represented by Pumelele Hole. Kumbaca, who was a prosecutor in the same court and former police captain, stands accused of two counts of corruption and defeating the ends of justice after he allegedly solicited a R25 000 tjotjo from an alleged drunk driving accused to have the docket destroyed. On Wednesday, Hole was not in court. When asked where he was, Kumbaca said in the building in a different court. Elliot asked for Hole’s cellphone number, but Kumbaca said it was in the holding cells. Outside court, Hole told Daily Sun: “The matter was called in B court. Kumbaca had told A court magistrate, Elliot, that he had instructed me to bring a bail application on new facts.” He said the accused would instruct him on the bail application on the new facts. “If that application was brought, then the matter would be sent to B court for the hearing of the application.”
