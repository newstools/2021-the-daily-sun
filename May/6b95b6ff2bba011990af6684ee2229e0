ORLANDO Pirates face a near impossible task of advancing to the Caf Confederation Cup semifinals. A 1-1 draw against Raja Casablanca truly felt like a loss for the Buccaneers, seen with the frustration etched on the faces of Josef Zinnbauer’s men as they left Orlando Stadium yesterday. A first-half goal from Vincent Pule was cancelled out by Ben Malango’s equaliser in the second half, ensuring the two sides will go into next week’s return leg in Morocco evenly matched. But in truth, Raja have the edge, having bagged the crucial away goal that also have them a huge psychological boost. Pule profited from a poor clearance, ran towards the goal to ram in low past Raja ‘keeper Anas Zniti in the 39th minute. But the opening goal didn’t quite take the wind out of Raja’s sails as they pushed their bodies behind the ball and took the game to the host. Malango skinned two defenders to find the leveller on the hour mark. Zinnbauer threw his glasses to the floor out of exasperation while his counterpart Lassaad Chabbi celebrated wildly. The Bucs coach knew what the away meant for his side and his opponents. There were enough chances for Bucs to get a win, three goals even. However, it is not over for Bucs. They still have a second leg to force a win, even though placing a bet on them achieving victory in Casablanca is as risky as betting on a rookie jockey winning at the Durban July.
