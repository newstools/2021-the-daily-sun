WHEN lockdown began in Mzansi, soldiers were seen forcing women and men to do push-ups and frog jumps for breaking Covid-19 regulations. In Rwanda, a newly married couple was recently forced to stay the whole night at a stadium in Kigali for flouting lockdown regulations. Images shared by Rwandan local news outlets showed several people, including the bride and groom, sitting down while maintaining social distancing protocols in an outdoor stadium. The news outlets alleged the party was transported to the stadium after cops raided the wedding. ALSO READ: HONEYMOON DEMAND SHOCK! According to the Herald, a local news outlet in Zimbabwe, cops had stopped at least three weddings in Kigali because they exceeded the maximum of 20 guests. Some couples and their guests have been forced to spend long nights listening to public health messages over loudspeakers while being guarded by cops. Rwanda has been praised for its response to Covid-19 as it registered just 22 684 coronavirus cases with a total of 311 deaths since the pandemic began last year. One bride told the Daily Mail that spending a night in a stadium on her wedding day was a bad memory that will never fade. “Inflicting pain and shaming people like this doesn’t make us fear corona or observe measures,” said the bride.
