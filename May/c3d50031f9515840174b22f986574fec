TODAY is Africa Day. The day is intended to celebrate and acknowledge African solidarity, unity in diversity, creativity, challenges and successes, as well as the cultural and economic potential of the continent. Daily Sun recently caught up with praise poet Bishop Jessica Mbangeni, who spoke about her Africa Day celebration performance, to be aired virtually on YouTube for the next two weeks. “Because we’re currently in a pandemic and can’t gather and celebrate together, the performance is going to be virtual,” she said. “I hope my performance revives us of who we are as Africans. I hope it also reminds people that being African shouldn’t just be celebrated on this day, but also every day because we draw our strength from who we are.” ALSO READ | KHUZANI BOWS DOWN TO SHENGE Jessica, who made her mark when she joined multi-award-winning group Soweto Gospel Choir, said Africa Day is important to her. “This day means a lot to me because it shows that after everything we’ve been through, we’ve not lost ourselves,” she said. “Such events are very important in helping us remember who we are and reconnecting with our roots. I hope everyone enjoys my performance.” Mzansi celebrities also took to social media to share pictures of themselves wearing their traditional attire.
