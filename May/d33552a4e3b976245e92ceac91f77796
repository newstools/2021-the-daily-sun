SIX Zandspruit suspects will remain behind bars for mob killings. They briefly appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court for the first time yesterday. The six accused, one woman and five men, were represented by the same lawyer. Their families waited patiently for court proceedings, even though they were frustrated by how the six were picked out of more than 200 residents who were on the sports field. The case was postponed to 9 June for bail application. NPA spokeswoman Phindile Mjonondwane said the six suspects were accused of being involved in the brutal attack of eight alleged gang members. “The six cannot be named at this stage as the state intends to hold an identity parade. They appeared on charges of murder, kidnapping and attempted murder,” she said. Zandspruit came to a standstill on Wednesday morning of 19 May when nine alleged gang members were kidnapped, brutally beaten and burnt. A group of about 200 gatvol residents went out to search for the men who allegedly were robbing people in the area. The alleged gang was forcefully taken to the sports ground, where they were assaulted and burnt. Eight of the nine have died and one is in critical condition in hospital.
