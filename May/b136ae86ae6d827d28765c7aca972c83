It was a just a matter of - BY HOW MUCH? This has always been the question from most South African football fans, as Mamelodi Sundowns welcomed Al Aly in their Champions League quarter-final, second leg clash at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday. The Brazilians fans, include coach Manqoba Mngqithi there, dreamt BIG that Sundowns could overcome the 2-0 score, which the Club of the Century posted in Cairo last week. But their wishes were turned into a pipedream, as Sundowns were knocked out of the Champions League, and their march ended in Atteridgeville on Saturday, paving the semi-final way to Mosimane's Red Devils. It was just a sad exit for Sundowns who were knocked out by the coach,Â Pitso Mosimane, who in 2016 won the same cup with them. But that is football, a game of emotions, and the Sundowns bench must be aware. The Egyptian giants proceed to the next round with a 3-1 pasting of Sundowns, following Saturday's 1-1 draw. There's no cure for fumbling, and Downs players learnt it the hard way following their blunders within the first 20 minutes, and way into the second half. The Pharaohs buried the first chance they got in the 11th minute, via a Yasser Ibrahim header, following corner kick. Fighters as they are known, the Brazilians regrouped and pushed forward, as their former coach stood on the opposite bench, and their efforts were rewarded. Mosa Lebusa connected 100% with a Gaston Sirino set up and nodded home, but it was little too late. But that was just the tip of the mountain they still had to climb since the Egyptians were already three goals up, and with an away goal, which meant Sundowns had three more goals to bury to win the tie. Now it's back to the PSL for Sundowns who this week have Swallows in the DStv Premiership.
