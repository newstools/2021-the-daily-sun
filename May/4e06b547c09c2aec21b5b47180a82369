WHILE still mourning the death of King Goodwill Zwelithini and his wife Queen Mantfombi, the Zulu royal family has suffered yet another loss. This after King Zwelithini’s brother Prince Thiza Zulu (72) died on Friday, 21 May after a short illness. Prince Thiza was one of the remaining senior princes from KwaDlamahlahla Royal Palace and was close to Zwelithini as they grew up together. He led preparations for the late king’s burial as well as cleansing rituals for the amakhosi. Royal family spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu told Daily Sun the family was still going to meet to discuss funeral arrangements. Thiza’s death comes at a time when the royals are embroiled in a court battle over the coronation of new king, Misuzulu kaZwelithini. On Friday, the Pietermaritzburg High Court adjourned the urgent application filed by the late king’s daughters Princess Ntandoyenkosi Zulu and Princess Ntombizosuthu Zulu-Duma, who wanted to interdict the coronation. But the Kwakhangemankengane Royal Palace vowed to go on with the coronation. Their attorney, Musa Nsibande, said: “The court didn’t release the judgment or give any order to restrict my client to do anything they want to do.” The princesses’ attorney, Mondli Thusini, said if the respondent continued with the coronation they’d file another interdict. “The attack is on the will. It’s important that everyone stops and lets the process take place. They should let the court issue orders in terms of the dispute,” he said. The royal family has suffered four deaths recently. Last November, one of Zwelithini’s sons died after allegedly being drugged. The king died in March and the queen last month.
