CHAMPIONS Mamelodi Sundowns might have won the title race but they have no intentions of resting on their laurels. They seem determined to keep their record as good as possible, avoiding defeat in what was essentially a dead rubber for the Tshwane giants. They settled for a share of the spoils with the Dube Birds, playing out a goalless draw at Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday. This was Swallows’ 19th draw of the season, extending their record of having played the most draws in a single campaign. They have now beaten the previous record by two more draws. Brandon Truter’s charges remain in fifth place on the Premiership table with 43 points from 28 matches. They remain alive in the race for continental football as they look to sneak into third place. Downs, on the other hand, have done their job and are now hoping to finish with as many points as possible. They were not in a generous mood as some might have imagined having wrapped up the title, they denied Swallows their first win in seven matches. Downs, who made wholesale changes, still looked strong which is a testament to the depth in their squad. The Brazilian made a total of seven changes with goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse, Rushine De Reuck, Khuliso Mudau, Lyle Lakay Mothobi Mvala, Lebohang Maboe and Peter Shalulile all coming into the team. Meanwhile, Truter made four changes with Zephaniah Mbokoma, Ruzaigh Gamildien, Kgaogelo Sekgota and Njabulo Ngcobo coming into the starting line-up.
