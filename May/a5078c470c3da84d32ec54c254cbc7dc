AMAZULU’s DStv Premiership title hopes have been dealt a huge blow. This after they suffered an agonizing 1-0 defeat at the hands of Baroka at the King Zwelithini Stadium on Tuesday. Richard Mbulu’s first-half strike was enough to hand Bakgaga the all-important three points at the expense of the inform Usuthu. The result was a huge setback for Benni McCarthy’s Usuthu in their hot pursuit of leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. They remain seven points adrift of the Tshwane giants having played one game more than the leaders. Downs, who are not in league action this week as they are away in Cairo on Caf Champions League duty, will have been pleased with the result. This brings them a step closer to defending their title and continuing their dominance in the PSL. For Usuthu, it’s back to the drawing board after their impressive 16-match unbeaten run was snapped by Bakgaga. And it does not get any easier for the KwaZulu Natal outfit who need to get maximum points in their next match against Soweto giants Orlando Pirates to keep their slim title hopes alive. That match will take place at the Orlando Stadium two weeks from now.Baroka, meanwhile, took a massive step towards safety with their dogged performance. They are in 10th place on the Premiership standings with 29 points from 26 matches. The Limpopo side were determined to pull off an upset against Usuthu and they started the match with plenty of vigour. They were rewarded when striker Mbulu bagged his 7th league goal with a sweet strike on his weaker left foot past a hapless Veli Mothwa in the Usuthu goal in the first half. And try as they might, Usuthu could not break Bakgaga’s solid defence marshalled by the towering Oscarine Masuluke in goal. They now move on to the Limpopo derby against Nedbank Cup champions Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) next Tuesday (3pm).
