SCORES of Rivers of Living Waters Ministries congregants packed the Sebokeng Magistrates Court in the Vaal on Friday, south of Joburg, in support of their spiritual father. This comes after the church’s leader Archbishop Stephen Zondo appeared briefly amid charges of rape and defeating the ends of justice. Some of the charges on the charge sheet allegedly happened 41 years ago in 1980 when Zondo was 14 years old. While the court was in session, the congregants prayed in tongues outside the court with many carrying “hands off Archbishop Zondo” placards and banners. Some the church pastors came out in their numbers dressed in their attires as congregants painted the courtyard yard red and blue. Church hymns, chanting and whistling were the order of the day as Public Order Policing officers closely monitored the gathered dozens. ALSO READ: YOUNG MADALA'S GROWING PAIN! The case was transferred for trial in the Pretoria High Court on 23 August. When the court was adjourned, congregants went into a frenzy and ululated. Those in cars were hooting, while those on foot touched his hands as he waved through his Fortuna SUV. Zondo and his church members then went to the newly built structure of their church branch in Sonland Park where they were briefed before celebrating with him.
