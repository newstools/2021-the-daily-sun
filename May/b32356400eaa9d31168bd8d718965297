EMERGENCY management services workers often find themselves staring down the barrel of a gun while trying to help people. They get robbed and are sometimes raped and murdered. EMS staff marched from Newtown in the CBD to the Gauteng health department offices on Thursday, 13 May, to hand over a memorandum of demands. Security issues topped the list of their concerns and demands. A female paramedic told Daily Sun she didn’t feel safe at work. “I have to do what I must to service the community,” she said.  She works in a female-only crew, and this exposes them to dangerous thugs. Another paramedic said: “People come to our base and rob us of our cellphones. They ask for an ambulance but rob us of our belongings.” ALSO READ: AKA
PUTS BIG PERFORMANCE ON ICE! Speaking on behalf of the marchers, Tshepo Mahlangu said: “Today is the last time that we’re submitting the memo.” “If the MEC (Nomathemba Mokgethi) doesn’t respond positively within seven days, we’re going to close all EMS offices in Gauteng to get what we want.” Spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said the health department will engage relevant stakeholders.
