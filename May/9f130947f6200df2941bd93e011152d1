THE four people accused of killing Samwu members in the Vhembe district in Limpopo appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrate Court on Friday, 28 May. They’re accused of allegedly killing Timson Musetsho (50) and Ronald Mani (50) in January 2019. It’s believed the two were targeted for being vocal against those implicated in the brazen looting of R2,3 billion from the VBS Mutual Bank, that saw politicians and municipal officials being arrested. Provincial NPA spokeswoman, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said the bail application of the four accused, Percy Radzuma (33), Simon Radzuma (26) and their elder brother Ndivhuwo Radzuma as well as their co-accused Thabo Sibanze from eSwatini, was postponed to 18 June for centralisation of cases.

Speaking outside the court, ANC regional secretary Advocate Anderson Mudunungu said: “We cannot protect people, regardless of their position in the ANC, if they are corrupt and have element of killing other comrades. Our fallen slain comrades were killed because they don’t want to protect corruption and looting of the funds in municipalities, meant for services delivery.” Mashudu Mani, who represented the Mani and Musetsho families, said they could now see light in the case. Mani thanked the Vhembe communities who came out in their numbers to support the two affected families and said without the people’s support, they couldn’t make it. Beside the two murder cases, the two brothers Simon and Percy Radzuma, were also found positively linked several other cases including murder, robbery, attempted murder, house robbery, kidnapping, theft of motor vehicle, possession of illegal fire arms and ammunition for crimes allegedly committed from 2018 and earlier this year.. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the two accused brothers were initially arrested in Rwanda Village in Letsitele policing area outside Tzaneen for possession of firearms and ammunition on Friday, 19 March.
