Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer believes it is ‘advantage Raja Casablanca’ at the halfway point of their CAF Confederation Cup quarterfinal following the 1-1 draw in Soweto on Sunday. Pirates took the lead through Vincent Pule in the first half, but were pegged back after the break and then spurned a number of late opportunities to score. They will now travel for the away leg next Sunday, which is scheduled for the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca. "It was a good game for us, but the result was a little bit disappointing," Zinnbauer said. "Why? Because the team works very hard and in the last minute we had one or two chances to score but we didn't get the result we wanted before the game. We have to fight now for the next match. "In football you have all the possibilities. For us it's better to win a game at home and it's clear, don't concede. "Sure, it's advantage for opponents, they scored [an away goal]. But we have also possibilities to score [away] and if you score then it's not easy for the opponent, they have to score more.” Zinnbauer praised the level of both teams and says he will work a plan for the second leg. "Raja was better, like us, it was a good game, top level. For me, my team worked well. Raja also. Both teams went forward and wanted to score. "For me, two top teams meet again on Sunday and we are looking forward to it. We know they are a big team. We are going to play in a big stadium and we will work on it." The winner of the tie will advance to the semifinals and a likely meeting with Egyptian side Pyramids FC, who thumped Nigeria’s Enyimba 4-1 in the first leg of their match-up. -SuperSport
