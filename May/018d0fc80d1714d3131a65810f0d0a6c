UNIVERSAL Music Group South Africa, along with record label Kalawa Jazmee, will be paying tribute to kwaito legend Emmanuel Mojalefa Matsane, popularly known as Mjokes. The recording labels will host a memorial service in Newtown today to remember the talented musician who was part of iconic group Trompies, best known for its hit song Sweety Lavo. Mjokes died in a car accident on Sunday morning while driving home from a performance with his group in Meadowlands, Soweto. Speaking to Daily Sun, his wife Lydia Sikwane said she couldn’t believe that her life partner was no longer alive. “I’m in disbelief. I knew something was wrong when the police called and asked when I last saw him. They then called me to the scene, where the car had fallen down a cliff. It has not sunk in yet that he’s gone as I can still see his face and smile,” she said.

His name is Jazmee. I named him after Kalawa Jazmee. He’s following that name. He’s about to release his debut album and we’re looking forward to that. We’re also planning to collaborate on a song together. It only makes sense that I work with my son, especially because La Familia Records belongs to both of us,” said Mjokes at the time. The memorial service at Newtown Music Factory will start at 1pm and it will also be streamed live.
