THERE is light at the end of the tunnel for shack dwellers who desperately need services. The Human Settlements Department has officially introduced a contractor to work on re-blocking Kliptown extension 7, south of Joburg. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, MMC for Housing Mlungisi Mabaso said the process to realign shacks in the area so services could be provided was back on track. He said the five month delay was due to problems the department faced. The MMC said that he understood residents had lost trust in politicians, but there was work to do. “I want to make a difference before my term ends,” he said. Mabaso said the budget for the project was R28 million, which would include money to provide jobs for residents. “People who live here are going to benefit from this project.” When asked about a backlog in providing houses, he said the problem had been there since he was six years old. He said it was a sad situation, but he’d do his best to improve residents’ living conditions. Mabaso said that re-blocking involved making shacks face each other so there was a common courtyard and single point of entry. “Re-blocking will help embetter people’s lives as they will have water, electricity and roads. Ambulances and police cars will be able to arrive on time,” said the MMC. But residents said they would only believe his promises until they saw change. Musa Mkhize (41) said he was tired of living in terrible conditions. Themba Zwane (36) said he was raised in a shack and his mum died waiting for change. “I’ll believe in this project once we see progress and changes in our community,” he said. Councillor Lulama Sibanyoni said she was happy to see the project finally taking off. “Residents have been waiting for change for a long time, and finally seeing it happen is exciting. I hope the contractor will work well with the community.” Masston Construction Projects director, Tony Masala, said he could not wait to start working on the project.
