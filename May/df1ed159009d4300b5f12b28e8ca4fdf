THE Gauteng Department of Education has expressed disappointment after violence broke out at Theresa Park Primary School in Tshwane on Thursday morning , 13 May. A video has been circulating on social media showing parents forcibly removing the school principal from the school’s premises by carrying her on a chair before she fell to the ground. According to the parents, they wanted the principal to vacate her office after she was accused of mistreating her staff. The department said according to the information at their disposal, the circuit management team in the district was sent to the school to mediate the quarrel that unfolded between the principal and the parents. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said they were investigating the allegations that have been levelled against the principal and the School Governing Body. @AdvoBarryRoux At #LaerskoolTheresapark this morning.

Indeed it’s unfortunate that parents resorted to such conduct in a school environment, exposing our children to such unpalatable behaviour,” he said. Lesufi pleaded with parents to address their grievances amicably without disrupting teaching and learning at the school, as it was difficult to recover lost teaching time. “This is completely unacceptable. We cannot allow our principal to be treated like this. We strongly condemn this behaviour,” said Lesufi. He said he’ll communicate the outcome once the investigations were concluded.
