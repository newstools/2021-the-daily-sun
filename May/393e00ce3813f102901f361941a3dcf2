THE 21-year-old who’s heard in a viral audio clip speaking to Bishop Israel Makamu has broken her silence. The woman, who was 17-years-old at the time, had an exclusive interview with the founder of Movement Against Abuse in Churches, Solomon Ashoms. She said she remembers the telephonic conversation in which the bishop can be heard asking her for sexual favours as if it was yesterday. She said she used to live in Eden Park with a friend when she received a call at night from Makamu. She said Makamu asked her to come fetch keys in Thokoza and when she arrived, he apparently asked her to get into the car.

She also said her roommate advised her to take a video or record him if he crossed the line again. She said on the night when she recorded the call, she was alone and her roommate was in Mpumalanga. “He didn’t come and a few days later, my roommate came back but I decided to go back home,” she said. She apparently told her father about this and he confronted him but he denied everything. The woman, who was working as Makamu’s receptionist, said she saw him as a father and had even told him she was a virgin. “He asked me about it and at the time, I didn’t think he wanted to do such a thing. I thought this information might be needed for some spiritual connection,” she said. ALSO READ: WATCH: BISHOP MAKAMU - I DIDN'T ASK FOR A POKE!
