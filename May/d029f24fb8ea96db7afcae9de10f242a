A motorist whose vehicle was spiked on the N4 Highway in Tshwane on Tuesday, 25 May is lucky not to have been robbed. Tshwane Metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said: “On Tuesday at about 5.30am, Tshwane Metro Police Department members were patrolling the N4 highway when they noticed a vehicle that had stopped on the side of the road with its hazards on near the Solomon Mahlangu Drive off-ramp. The Metro officers quickly rushed to check what was happening.” He said on arrival, they found the motorist had just been spiked as one of his vehicle’s tyres had hit the spikes that were placed on the road. “The officers called for backup to check for criminals that could still be nearby as the motorist was fortunately not robbed. “They searched the nearby area and no one was found. They helped the motorist to change the tyre.” According to Mahamba, the motorist explained to the officers that he had driven into something that looked like a plastic bag when he heard the puncture. “Well done to the Tshwane Metro police constable for his swift response. However, Mahamba said they had previously warned motorists to be more vigilant when driving on the N4 highway due to this escalating new crime trend where motorists get robbed after their vehicles are spiked. “These spikes are usually placed by criminals to force vehicles to stop after driving over the spikes. Motorists are then attacked by these perpetrators, especially at night and in the early hours of the morning. Targeted areas are mostly highways and quiet roads.” Mahamba said they would continue prioritising patrols along such roads. He said no arrests were made at this stage. He appealed to anyone with information regarding this crime to contact the department on 012 358 7095/7096.
