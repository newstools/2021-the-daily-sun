SINCE his dirty laundry was aired in public, bad luck seems to be following former Expresso Morning Show presenter Katlego Maboe. This comes after he was snubbed by the South African Film and TV Awards. The Saftas have withdrawn Katlego from the nomination list under the Best TV Presenter Public Vote category. It’s still unclear if this decision was based on the video clip in which Katlego confessed to cheating on his wife went viral last year. The awards issued a statement on Friday 14 May, confirming Katlego has been removed from the list of nominees.
