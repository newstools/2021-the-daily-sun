A gogo (71)
and two others were arrested in possession of drugs. The three
suspects were bust with drugs worth more than R15 000 by members of the
Ekurhuleni Metro police’s drug enforcement unit on Sunday morning, 9 May, in
Eden Park. Police said
the officers who were patrolling the area stopped and searched a suspicious
46-year old man, along with the gogo. During the
search, they found 18 ziplock bags and one medium-sized plastic bag containing
53,3 grams of khat valued at R12 600. Ekurhuleni
Metro police spokesman Kobeli Mokheseng said: “On their way to process the two
suspects, officers noticed a very nervous 30-year-old man nearby the scene of
the crime. The suspect was approached and frisked at 7.45am, before five
Mandrax tablets as well as 12 ziplock bags of khat valued at R2 500 and R120
cash were exposed. The trio, facing charges of possession and possible dealing
in illicit substance, were escorted to the Eden Park Police Station.” The three
are expected to appear in the Palmridge Magistrates Court soon.
