THE Department of Sport, Arts and Culture has come to the rescue of Zithulele “Majotha” Zungu’s family. The maskandi artist died last Friday after a short undisclosed illness. The Zungu family, as well as other artists, had appealed to Minister Nathi Mthethwa to help bury him. At the time, Cebo Zungu told Daily Sun that the funeral would be held on Sunday. “My brother was a big brand with hundreds of fans. He also made close friends with not just maskandi artists, but other genres of music, too. “We therefore expect a large number of people to pay their last respects. We appeal to our municipality to help with funeral costs,” he said. ALSO READ: SKEEM SAAM CHANGING THINGS UP! The late Zungu’s friend, Sgwebo Sentambo, had also pleaded with Mthethwa’s office to intervene. “He never worked for the past two years and I know he was struggling.” On Tuesday, 11 May, Mthethwa’s spokeswoman Masechaba Ndlovu said the department was consulting with the family and would help with funeral costs. “Normally, the family would submit a written request from a representative, indicating the kind of assistance they require. “From this point the department would respond to indicate the amount that can be afforded and advise on processes to be followed,” said Ndlovu. Brother Zungu confirmed that officials had already contacted them. “We’ve received some financial assistance from the minister’s office. Unfortunately, I can’t disclose how much was paid or what costs it will be covering. “However, we’re also expecting our local municipality to contribute towards the funeral,” he said.
