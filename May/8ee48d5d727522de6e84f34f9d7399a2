The tit for tat in the ANC is perhaps a sign of how the once glorious movement has deteriorated! The ANC is notorious for creating uncontrollable monsters like Msholozi, Juju, Ace, etc! These monsters, when fully developed, begin to feed off their creator, the ANC! Magashuleâ€™s tantrums are nothing but a determination to prove himself to be bigger than the party and the discipline of its leadership. And these internal ructions are tearing the party apart! Can you expect something good to come out of a person who sought counsel from renegade Zuma? Ace has done nothing but tarnish the image of the SG office. Fire Ace and his cronies and see how the party will prosper without them! Letter Bushy Green, Kagiso
