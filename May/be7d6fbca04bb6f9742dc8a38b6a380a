TOP celebrities have endorsed the launch of a new beauty spa aimed at helping Mzansi to distress and prevent suicidal actions. Imbewu: The Seed actress Swazi Mokoena, singer Kelly Khumalo, DJ Kotini and comedian Siyanda Maphumulo made the launch of the Moon Beauty Spa in Durban Central on Saturday, 22 May. The spa was founded by the manager of Umlazi Gospel Choir and event organiser, Sakhile Thenjwayo. This was after he noticed that many people were committing suicide because of stress. Sakhile told SunBuzz that he knew many people wanted to go to a spa to distress, but they were too far and expensive. “Normal spas are in fancy hotels that are too far, and many people can’t afford them. “I tried to bring it closer to our people in a central place where anyone can come, and the prices are lower,” he said.

I congratulate Sakhile for achieving his dreams where he’ll also be helping many people to distress,” she said. Kelly, DJ Kotini and Siyanda entertained the audience with great performances during the launch.
