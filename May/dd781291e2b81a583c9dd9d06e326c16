KING Goodwill Zwelithini’s siblings, Princess Thembi Ndlovu and Prince Mbonisi Zulu, have promised to support new King Misuzulu. However, they’re still angry that Prince Thokozani Zulu was not given a chance to speak after Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu’s will was read on Friday, 7 May. Princess Thembi said there was nothing wrong with Prince Thokozani standing up to ask questions after the will named Prince Misuzulu as the new king. She told Daily Sun that Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi was supposed to have given him a chance to avoid unnecessary conflict. “The way things happened on Friday made it look like we were fighting. But in reality, we were not. Prince Mangosuthu could have handled the matter better,” she said. “It’s very hard to talk when he’s there because he reprimands very harshly, even before he can hear what you’re about to say. Maybe Prince Thokozani was going to congratulate the new king, but he was shut down before he spoke.” When Prince Thokozani stood up to ask questions, Buthelezi ordered him to sit down. This led to a chaotic situation, leading to Prince Misuzulu fleeing the scene. Prince Thokozani is the son of Prince Penuel Zulu, brother of the late king’s late father. Many expected Princess Thembi and Prince Mbonisi to dispute the will. Princess Thembi said they were united behind the new king as he was King Zwelithini’s son. “The chaos that happened was unnecessary because no one was fighting. I think the reason bodyguards evacuated Prince Misuzulu was because of the chaos,” she said. Prince Mbonisi told Daily Sun that they supported the new king. “Our role as senior members of the royal house is to support the one who has been appointed as the king by the will,” he said.
