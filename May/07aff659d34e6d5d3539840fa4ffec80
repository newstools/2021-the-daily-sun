Part of our collective heritage are the places of memory representing the people who, through struggle and sacrifice, liberated South Africa from the yoke of apartheid and oppression. It is an indictment on our current leadership that so many places of heritage are neglected and in various stages of disrepair. Last month, it was reported that Robben Island, which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1999, is falling into disrepair. Also last month as politicians hit the pavements to make speeches about Charlotte Mxeke’s 150th birthday, the house she lived in lies in squalor and neglect. This is the common state of many places of significance in South Africa’s unique story of oppression and liberation.  On Thursday, the Liliesleaf Trust, which owns one of South Africa’s seminal liberation historical sites of memory, together with the EU Delegation to South Africa and the Daily Sun will host the launch of an exciting South African / European Union collaboration: a virtual exhibition on the untold story of the EU’s role in overcoming Apartheid.  This exhibition celebrates Freedom Day and Europe Day, but also draws attention to the Trust’s need for support to keep the site preserved for future generations. The launch will be followed by a discussion on how critical it is to ensure the survival of the country’s Centres of Memory. As 19th century Jamaican political activist Marcus Garvey said: “A people without knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.”  The launch takes place on May 6 from 3.30pm to 5pm and you can register here: https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/south-africa/97718/register-attend-our-europe-day-2021-webinar-past-important-future-6-may-2021-15h30-17h00_en
