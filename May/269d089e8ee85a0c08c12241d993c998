Gogo Tshinakaho Mudau (82) said she’s happy her son’s wife and the three men accused of killing him were denied bail. Her son was the breadwinner in the family. “I used to worry and have sleepless nights each time the woman accused of hiring hitmen to kill my child applied for bail,” said Gogo Mudau. She said her son was everything to the family as he took care of all of them and had also hired many people in his company. She said his death was a loss not only to the family but the community at large. Her son Azwifaneli Mudau (37) was a well-known businessman in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. The founder of Ria livhuwa Electrical Engineering lived in Makwarela Extension, just outside Thohoyandou. He was gunned down outside his gate on 14 February 2019 after his wife allegedly called him and asked him to bring two loaves of bread and pocket money for their kids. The three alleged hitmen and the wife who’s accused of conspiracy to murder appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrates Court on Friday and they were remanded in custody. The case was postponed to 30 August for further investigations. The gogo said if the accused had been granted bail, she feared her life and the family could have been in danger. “We, as family, congratulate the police investigation officer and the prosecution authority for dealing with this case in a good way. I want these monsters to rot in jail. They thought they will just kill my son in a cruel way and walk free and commit more crimes in the communities,” said Mudau.
