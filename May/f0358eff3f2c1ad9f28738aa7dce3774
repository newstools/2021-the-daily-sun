Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon said he has received offers from other clubs as he contemplates his next move, having decided on leaving Turin at the end of the season. The 43-year-old first joined Juventus from Parma in 2001 and has been there ever since, apart from one season at French side Paris St Germain in 2018-19, but revealed this week he plans to leave the club in the summer. Buffon's game-time has been restricted this season, but he showed he can still cut it at the very top as he saved a penalty and made several other fine stops on his return to the starting team in Juve's 3-1 win at Sassuolo on Wednesday. Retirement is not on the cards just yet, with plenty of suitors already showing an interest. "I arrived at Juve as a boy with a lot of enthusiasm and less balance, and I go away as a happy man," Buffon told DAZN. "For my future I take 20-25 days. I have received some offers and I want to see if I am enthusiastic, how the desire settles down. "I have always given enthusiasm and determination, if someone manages to give it to me too I would gladly welcome it." -REUTERS
