The former DA MP Phumzile Van Damme said she only resigned from parliament, not from the party. This is despite the party’s spokeswoman Siviwe Gwarube issuing a statement saying the party had accepted her resignation as an MP and from the party. “The DA has received and accepted the resignation of Phumzile Van Damme as a Member of Parliament and from the party. We extend our best wishes to Phumzile and thank her for her extraordinary service to the DA in parliament and by extension, the country,” Gwerube said on Thursday, 20 May. After Van Damme posted on Twitter on Friday, 21 May, saying she didn’t resign from the party but only from parliament, social media users accused her of making a U-turn.

I honestly think it was a misunderstanding on the party’s part,” she said. Van Damme said she is not going to throw any insults at people in the DA ahead of election. “I’m not going to publicly throw mud at anyone in the DA. There is an election ahead and I won’t compromise it for those who are and have worked hard. It’s for them I do so. This is my position and I made it clear to the leadership. Thank you and that’s all I have to say on the matter,” she said. When SunTeam asked Gwarube to clarify the matter, she said: “The DA leadership welcomes Ms Van Damme’s reassurance that she has not resigned from the party.”
