DETAILS of how technology
entrepreneur Fahim Saleh was killed have merged. His former assistant Tyrese
Haspil is accused of beheading and mutilating him. Haspil was fired from his
assistant job while working for Saleh. The 33-year-old tech tycoon
was discovered beheaded and mutilated in his living room in Manhattan. His
head, arms and legs below the knees were cut off and stuffed into black plastic
bags. His chest lay bare near a Makita electric saw that was still plugged into
the wall. Somehow, there was no trace
of blood in the apartment and it was so accurately scrubbed that an official
later described it as a “professional job”. But the accused wasn’t a
professional. According to Business
Insider, for five years the charismatic Haspil had been entrusted with just
about everything and keeping track of his boss’ finances, before he was fired. Saleh, who had an estimated
net worth of R2 billion, then discovered that Haspil had stolen about R1,3
million from him. Rather than reporting him to the cops, he decided to let
Haspil pay back the money, but he never did. Instead, Haspil reportedly
entered the building where his former boss lived and hid himself in a
stairwell, waiting all morning for him. He then followed him into
the lift, which opened directly into his apartment. Haspil then used a taser on
Saleh, and he collapsed. He then allegedly stabbed him five times in the neck
and torso, according to the medical examiner. Wounds on Saleh’s left hand
indicated that he had tried to defend himself, police sources said. According to
usalatestnews.com, a concerned cousin who had stopped by when she hadn’t heard
from Saleh, found his torso the following day. “I could never imagine
someone like Saleh having any enemies,” the cousin said.
