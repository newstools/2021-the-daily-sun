A ZIMBABWEAN man recently said he was planning to marry his 17th wife this month. The 66-year-old Misheck Nyandoro has 151 children and 16 wives, but dreams of having 100 wives. While in South Africa, a sangoma shook the country when he married six women on the same day last year. Faniyakhe Mthembu from Umhlabuyalingana, KZN said the Covid-19 pandemic forced him to reconsider his plans of taking more wives. “It would be selfish of me to make 14 women leave their homes, marry me and then I die. “Because I make most of my money from healing people, it means I could die sooner and they’ll suffer for the rest of their lives if I’m not here to provide for them,” he said. But these men who have hopes of big families are just beginners compared to this family from India. Ziona (74) is a father to a whooping 94 children.  He’s the head of the family who all live together in a four-storey, 100-room mansion. According to Dailystar.co.uk, Ziona said he is “blessed” to have 39 wives. As a result of his polygamous lifestyle, he also has 14 daughters-in-law and 33 grandchildren – that’s a 180-strong household in total. The father’s married daughters live separately with his 26 sons-in-law. Ziona married his first wife, Zathiangi, when he was 17 years old and she runs the household activities. The Daily Mail reported that one evening mealtime requires 30 chickens and they grow much of their food in their back garden.
