NORMA Mngoma is a bitter liar! This is how she was painted by her estranged husband Malusi Gigaba at the Zondo Commission on Monday, 31 May. Gigaba said the commission should ask why she only came forward after their divorce became public. He said she fabricated the story about how the Guptas bankrolled his lifestyle and had him on a leash. “Because there’s an ulterior motive to put me in bad light, she has to fabricate this story so carefully that it doesn’t implicate her because if she saw me being given Illicit money, it implicates her in an illegality. “When she was being coached in her affidavit, she was told: ‘recuse yourself, you did not see him being given the money. You only saw it in the boot and you can only infer it came from the Guptas’. There was no such money that I got from the Guptas in a brown leather bag,” said Gigaba. He said at one stage, Mngoma told him she was being put under pressure by people in government, state security and business to “surrender him” as they wanted to destroy him politically. “My political destruction would result in her being financially rewarded. “She said she would not do that,” Gigaba claimed. He denied her version that he did not like former SAA board chairwoman Dudu Myeni. Gigaba said the bag that Mngoma claimed he used to carry cash was in fact used for his cellphone, sanitiser and hand lotion. He said that it was a lie that he helped the Guptas get citizenship and they gave him a white BMW. “Chairperson, you are dealing with a lie.” Gigaba said when he met Mngoma, she had money and claimed to have a rich father in New York. “I was to learn later that this so-called father was in fact her fiance who lived in Joburg and had left her an inheritance,” he said.
