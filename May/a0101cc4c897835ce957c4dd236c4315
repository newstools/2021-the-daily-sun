I’VE always heard people talk about the “last kick of a dying breed”. This often stems from the final moments of an existing thing or event. Take the 4-5 for instance, this phallic structure is renowned for sexual pleasures and the excretion of liquids. While we all know the 4-5 brings a lot of sexual pleasures, according to sexual experts and pathologists, it can have an erection even after the passing of someone. According medical experts, a death erection, angel lust, or terminal erection is a post-mortem erection. Technically a priapism (a prolonged erection of the 4-5) is usually observed in the corpses of men who have been executed, particularly by hanging. According to Wiki-medics, the phenomenon has been attributed to pressure on the cerebellum created by the noose. Spinal cord injuries are known to be associated with priapism. Injuries to the cerebellum or spinal cord are often associated with priapism in living patients. According to Media-soft pedi, a death erection is a post-mortem erection happening when the man dies vertically or face-down and the corpse remains so. When the body is dead, the smooth muscles of the arteries relax but this is not enough. The blood cannot enter the 4-5 as the heart no longer pumps it, creating pressure for entering the penis’ vessels. In the dead body, only gravitation acts on the blood. This means the blood accumulates at the lowest point of the body, provoking a swelling of the dead tissue. The upper located part of the body discolours, leaving the dead body with a reddish to bluish-purple colour. In the mentioned cases, the blood enters by gravitation into the dead penis, causing an erection.
