ALTHOUGH she’s a sangoma, she still turns heads whenever she steps out of the house. This is because Snegugu Mgobhozi, known as Makhosi Nyoniyezulu, asked her ancestors to allow her to slay even though she’s a sangoma. The 25-year-old from Zweli­bomvu outside Pinetown, KZN always dresses to kill, wears make-up, does her nails and sometimes styles her ancestral cloth (ibhayi) by adding fashion accessories when she goes out with friends or to a business meeting. Snegugu said accepting her calling wasn’t difficult as she was shown everything in her dreams. “Luckily enough, they didn’t want me to change the way I was living, which made my journey very easy because there were no adjustments in my life,” she said. She told Daily Sun she started to have scary dreams in 2019, but she ignored them. She decided to accept her calling early last year when she started to develop sharp abdominal pains. “I was studying project management at Damelin College at the time. I had to make an arrangement with the school so that I could go to initiation school,” she said. Snegugu said she also had to talk to her ancestors to allow her to continue with school. She started her initiation in May last year and graduated in December. She said although she didn’t have an indumba, she changed into her ancestral clothes when she had to attend to her ancestral duties. “I perform most of my ancestral duties at the river. I travel to all provinces when my service is needed. I also do consultations online,” she said. Snegugu is also a qualified public relations practitioner and project manager with her own company.
