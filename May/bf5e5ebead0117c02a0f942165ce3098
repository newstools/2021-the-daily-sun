The Hawks arrested an alleged cash-in-transit robber alleged
to have been involved in a heist in Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal, last month. The Serious Organised Crime Unit apprehended the 35-year-old
on Wednesday, Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said. "It is alleged that security guards were delivering
cash at Central Park when they were accosted by armed suspects at gunpoint. The
suspects robbed them of their service firearms and an undisclosed amount of
cash," he said. Mhlongo said the robbers fled the scene in a getaway
vehicle, which was later found abandoned near Port Dunford. "A case of cash-in-transit robbery was reported at
Empangeni police station and the case docket was allocated to Hawks members
from Richards Bay Serious Organised Crime Unit for intensive
investigation." Mhlongo said the Hawks successfully traced and arrested a
suspect, who was allegedly one of the robbers. He was expected to appear in the Empangeni Magistrate's
Court on Friday. SOURCE: NEWS24
