IT’S easy to judge parents such as Nodumo Sotsopo. After all, no sane parent will chain their child in an effort to stop them from escaping their home. Chaining her son is her only solution as she can’t find help anywhere else. Sotsopo’s action is that of a desperate parent. Many parents who can’t deal with their addicted kids often resort to this cruel method. There are no rehab programmes or centres in most townships. To rid your child of this devil, you have to spend money on private rehab centres. If you just dropped in from Mars yesterday, you’d conclude that drugs are not a problem in our communities. The opposite is true, however, as drugs such as nyaope and whoonga are robbing Mzansi of its youth. Yet you hardly hear our president and ministers addressing this crisis. Their heads are too deeply buried in the sand. Parents of addicts have nowhere to turn and each day with their out-of-control children is a living hell. Mzansi’s bright future is being stolen, but politicians are too busy fighting factional battles to even care. – Editor
