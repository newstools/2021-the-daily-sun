ACTOR Menzi Biyela went from being a thug in Rhythm City to being a pastor in Uzalo. But some fans think he’s a tsotsi pastor. Social media users have said they can’t believe Mandlakhe, the right-hand man of the notorious thug Khulekani Ngobese (played by Mncedisi Shabangu), thinks he can now start preaching the word of God in Uzalo. “There are people who still can’t differentiate between a character and the person who portrays it. “It is sad because even on social media, I’ve seen people questioning the purposes of Pastor Gwala. Some were certain that he’s a crook pastor. But then I realised that they were judging my character based on who I was playing in Rhythm City.

I hope the Pastor Gwala character will educate people and show them there’s a difference between me as Menzi and the characters I portray on TV,” said Menzi. Menzi told Daily Sun his new role will reveal a different side of him as an actor. He hope it will make people stop judging him based on his gangster role. He said he’s noticed some people fear him when they see him as they believe he’s involved in dodgy dealings like Mandlakhe. Menzi also cleared the speculations about Pastor Gwala. He said Gwala is an honest pastor who has come to spiritually uplift the people of KwaMashu. He said the only difference between him and Gwala is the church. “I have a good heart like Pastor Gwala but not a churchgoer like him. I grew up attending Sunday School but as I was becoming older, I lost touch with church,” he said. Menzi is a multitalented artist. When he’s not shooting, he’s in studio cooking up some rap music.
