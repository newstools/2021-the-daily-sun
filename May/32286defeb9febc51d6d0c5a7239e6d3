A COUPLE of players have shown that they’ve got what it takes to play for their senior teams, and the platform was through the DStv Diski Challenge Rewired. On Sunday, all eyes will be on them as the curtain comes down on the competition when AmaZulu face Mamelodi Sundowns in the Diski Rewired final at FNB Stadium (noon). The two sides enjoyed impressive runs to the final. AmaZulu played all eight matches without defeat, and they will be out to maintain that record on Sunday and hoping to win the title. Sundowns’ eyes are also fixed on the prize as they know they cannot make any mistakes now, to completement their seniors who won the DStv Premiership for the fourth year in a row. AmaZulu striker Lindokuhle Zungu said they want to win the title for their chairman, Sandile Zungu, after the seniors could only fight for second position in the PSL. The lanky striker has been one of the key players for Usuthu, and fans will be dependant on him, alongside Msindisi Ndlovu, to carry their hopes against Downs. Zungu attends all their matches at the stadium chanting and singing for the young lads, alongside goalkeeper coach Moeneeb Josephs and first team coach Benni McCarthy. Lindokuhle, who has netted five goals already, said: “Our chairman treats us the same way. It’s not only about the first team, but he is also there for us.” AmaZulu Diski coach Siboniso Vilakazi said there is no pressure, adding that they just need to do their best on the field and things will fall into place. This will be Usuthu’s first final in the reserve league, while Downs will be appearing for the third time. Sundowns will pin hopes on Thando Buthelezi, Siyanda Nyanga and Musawenkosi Mdhluli. Downs coach, Surprise Moriri, said they are aware of the danger posed by Usuthu. “We are aware that if we do not give it our best on the day they will make things difficult for us,” said Moriri.
