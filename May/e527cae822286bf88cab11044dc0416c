JAKE White has expressed concerns over the new set of rules, especially the captain’s call. The Bulls won their second Rainbow Cup, edging the Stormers 20-16 at Cape Town Stadium at the weekend. But the astute Bulls coach had a lot more to say about the game than the scoreline. “I think it’s frustrating and it’s not only frustrating for us. It’s also frustrating for the players, the supporters and the people watching from home,” said White. The new rules give the captains one review apiece, which allows them to challenge the referee’s decision on potential foul play and try scoring incident. Like new things, the rule has been commended. it has also been criticised for the breaks it creates in matches. “If you freeze the frame of all those and you have the ability to look and see whether or not it’s accurately done, you could be opening yourself up for more scrutiny,” White added. But White is not averse to the rules, saying he understood why they needed to be introduced and the need for the players to adapt. “I’m a bit concerned that we mustn’t move away from the fact that it’s a contact sport and the players do run into each other. There is a chance that you get it wrong, and there needs to be some sort of feel from the officials as to whether or not there was intent. “It’s new to us and I’m sure that everyone will sit and debate, and maybe find a way in which we can have a happy medium.” In the other match, the Sharks beat the Lions 34-26 in Durban. The Lions coach, Ivan van Rooysen, said the Joburg side need to improve and finish off their opportunities going forward.
