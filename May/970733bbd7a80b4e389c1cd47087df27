A video of a cop klapping a motorist has hit the internet and left many people shocked. The video shows the cop klapping a motorist driving a Bently. He then cocks his gun but the motorist drives off before something worse could happen. It’s not clear where and when the video was taken, but people on social media are fuming. They want the cop to be dealt with harshly. “This is no way to treat other people. You can’t assault someone just because you’re a police officer,” said Sfundo on Twitter. Mbongeni said: “He needs to be arrested immediately.” The Road Traffic Management Corporation told Daily Sun: “This is nothing but an act of pure criminality and thuggery. Such behaviour is completely unacceptable and deserves the strongest censure.” The corporation said it had obtained some information but was following all leads to obtain more details and verify. “We urge members of the public not to tolerate such conduct and to lay criminal charges when confronted by such a situation. “Anyone with information on this case is requested to contact the RTMC on the WhatsApp number 083 293 7989 or e-mail ntacu@rtmc.co.za. Information will be treated in strict confidence.” Abuse of authority! pic.twitter.com/nQmOfnavI2
