COMMUNITY Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko said she loved chicken feet as they were delicious. Mazibuko also said she would continue supporting the local economy. The MEC was responding to the video that went viral on social media showing herself, ANC Joburg deputy secretary-general Loyiso Masuku and two others eating chicken feet. Mazibuko said after a long day of campaigning, they were starving and needed to eat. “We were working the whole day, so we had to find something to eat. Luckily, we found a woman selling chicken feet and we bought them with porridge. It is unfortunate that the video went viral.” Masuku said: “The comment about the ‘for the sake of the vote’ was in reference to working long hours during our election campaign, and not in any way to voters. It was in no way directed at anybody, and I sincerely apologise for the misunderstanding.”
