ARTIST Mercy Pakela and three others are demanding an end to the case against them that has dragged on for years. The four, including presenter Brenda Mbhele and radio and filmmaker Lungisani Mthethwa, were arrested at the Global Citizen Festival in Joburg on 2 December 2018 and released on free bail. They were among a group of artists who protested at the venue because they were angry they were not included in the line-up alongside international stars Beyonce Knowles and Jay Z. This led to their arrest. Mercy told Daily Sun the case has been a torture for her. “We’ve been attending this case since 2018, but there’s no progress,” she said. “What’s more frustrating is we can’t do any work or travel abroad due to our bail conditions ALSO READ | UZALO: MXOLISI AND AYANDA NOT RETURNING Lungisani has had to turn down all jobs outside of Joburg. “I’ve turned down lucrative jobs outside the country because my bail conditions don’t permit me to travel abroad,” he said. “All I want is for this case to be finalised so I can work.” Lungisani said they have begged the NPA to speed up the case. “It’s clear to us they want to slowly destroy our careers.” Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele referred questions to the NPA. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane had not responded to questions at the time of going to print.
