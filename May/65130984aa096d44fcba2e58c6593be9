Mamelodi Sundowns co-coach, Manqoba Mngqithi, says they will not go down without a fight. The whole of Africa is watching glued to South Africa this weekend as Africa's Club of Century, Al Ahly, under coach Pitso Mosimane, face Mzansi giant Sundowns, in the second leg of their Caf Champions League campaign in Atteridgeville on Saturday at 3pm. The north Africans bring with them a 2-0 cushion from the first leg that was played in Cairo.Now Sundowns will have to better that in this quarter-final tie, or equal it for penalty takes to determine semi-finalists. Mngqithi stubbornly says they will turn tables around. “We have a big responsibility on Saturday, no matter what happens in the game, but we will leave a piece of our skin inside the pitch,” Mngqithi declared during a virtual press conference on Thursday morning. “And if we do not overcome, it's football. But at this stage I believe. If we do not score one early, the second 45 minutes can be enough to score two more goals. Throughout we are going to fight to make sure that we turn the results around, we are not going to give it a chance, we will give our best shot.” Mngqithi added: “We will have to be calm and try to do the business, and we have done that match in, match out, more especially where everybody said it is mission impossible. “We have got the capacity. We have games that we can use as reference that this team can turn the tables. If there is any team that can bet Al Ahly 5-0, it is Sundowns: why? Because they have done it before." Without dwelling much on that, Mngqithi said they had done it before, and they can still do it. He stated: “We are the only team to have scored so many goals (5-0) against CR Belouizdad, the same Belouizdad that beat Esperance. So why can’t be confident that this is the team that has got the capacity of what is expected of them and willingly it will not be easy.”
