HE’S only 26 years old, but Admire Mninginisi already looks like a madala. Admire told Daily Sun his nightmare started when he was 15 years old. He said he developed growths all over his face and joints and also lost his hair. Admire is from Giyani in Limpopo but lives in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. He said the condition took everything from him, including his confidence. “I can’t even face a woman to ask her out because I find it difficult to look at beautiful people. I see someone else when I look in the mirror,” he said. Admire said when he was 15, his joints, knees, ankles and wrists started to swell up. “I experienced difficulties and had to repeat grade 10 in 2013. “In 2014, I came to live with my parents in Gauteng so they could find help for me,” he said. He said he failed matric in 2015 and had to rewrite it the following year. Admire said he started to accept his situation and registered for a hospitality course. “I passed my first year with four distinctions and this was very encouraging. In my second year, the condition got worse and my eyes and face started to change. But I still managed to pass with two distinctions,” he said. His unemployed father, Obed (45), expressed his frustrations. “We’ve been to different izangoma, prophets and churches.  “We’ve visited hospitals and doctors, but couldn’t get help,” he said. Obed said any help for his son would do. Dermatologist Professor Deepak Modi from Brenthurst Clinic suspects Admire might be suffering from progeria, an extremely rare, progressive genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly. Asked about plastic surgery, he said Admire’s condition was deeper than just facial looks and he needed to get his internal organs checked.
