THE Thohoyandou Magistrates Court postponed the bail application in a case of rape involving a teacher to Thursday, 27 May. He is facing three counts of rape. Limpopo Education Department spokeswoman Tidimalo Chenue said a report from the human resources section of the department indicated that the teacher accused of rape has tendered his resignation with the provincial education department. “The resignation was accepted and was processed accordingly. He has since been removed from our system,” said Chenue. She said as indicated earlier, they take the accusations against him seriously.

The idea of one then taking advantage of children in this alleged manner is most disturbing and we hope justice prevails in this case,’ said Chuene. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the alleged rape started when the pupil was 17 years old and continued until she was 20. He allegedly raped her at a lodge in Makhado twice and at his home. “He threatened her not to tell anyone and promised her R30 000, which the schoolgirl refused,” said Brigadier Mojapelo. Police also said the victim eventually opened a case of rape at the Thohoyandou Police Station last month.
