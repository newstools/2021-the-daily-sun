AS A young woman sangoma Rinah Kwena (32), known as gogo Nontsokolo, didn’t take her calling seriously because she didn’t want to sacrifice her youth. Asked Rinah: “Imagine being a young woman walking barefoot in the street with a head full of letsoku (red clay paste) and gallbladder in your hair? “Sleeping on the floor in a thatch-roof house, waking up before dawn and connecting with the ancestors?” She said she took to drinking in her previous life to run away from her calling. “But my calling kept following me,” she said. “I dreamt about a sangoma named Gumede from KZN, but I couldn’t locate her because there are many Gumedes. Then a sangoma directed me to gobela Gumede in Kwamajazana, south of Joburg.” Rinah, originally from Rammulotsi kasi in Viljoenskroon, Free State, now lives in Ikageng kasi in Potchefstroom, North West. “I’ve adjusted and the process has prepared me very well,” she said. Rinah is now a trained sangoma who’s completed the thwasa process, learnt how to defend against bad spirits and to wake up spirits. She can read bones and has learnt how to heal people. She walks with pride, now that she’s finally accepted her calling. “I’m proud that I’m able to heal and handle big problems. I’ve gained dignity in a short space of time,” she said. Rinah advised young people to not take their calling for granted. “It’s a gift from your forefathers, and it will not deny you anything you desire as the youth,” she said.
