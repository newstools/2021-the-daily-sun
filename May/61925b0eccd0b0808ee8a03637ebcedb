AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy, sarcastically, smiled and wished the Bafana Bafana new coach Hugo Broos all the best. McCarthy, all time goal scorer in the national team, was heavily linked with Bafana post. There were even reports that he agreed terms in principle with the South African Football Association (Safa) after meeting with its CEO Teboho Motlanthe. But McCarthy, who became Safa’s prime target after Carlos Queiroz turned the association down, put the association off, as he demanded that, if he takes over, he will want to come with his technical team that he has at AmaZulu. The association, under pressure from the public, then went with the former Cameroon coach, who was appointed on a five-year deal on Wednesday. When McCarthy was asked what advice he will give to Broos, the former FC Porto striker was initially reluctant as he knows whatever he says will be scrutinised. “Huh!,” that was McCarthy’s first reaction to the question. But he then said: “I think there’s a lot of potential in the team, there’s a lot of quality. We have got a good group of players, so I can’t see why there can’t be success. “All I can say to the new guy, the coach that is coming in, good luck and all the best to the World Cup qualifications and we will be rooting for Bafana.” The media laughed afterwards, prompting him to McCarthy to laugh too. “Hawu! I can only give them my best wishes, more I can’t do.”
