IT’S like a toll gate at the hostel. Strangers who want to go through have to pay a fee. A security guard, who was bringing a sick friend home to the KwaThema hostel on Wednesday, refused to pay the men controlling the gate. The guard was assaulted and they took his service pistol, R350 cash and his cellphone. He opened a case at Kwa-Thema Police Station in Springs, and one suspect was arrested. Residents of the squatter camp near the hostel said a group of men ran the hostel like they owned it. “They make you pay R5, R10 or even more to pass through it. At night you can even pay more than R50,” said Sfiso Vilakazi. Constable Nkululeko Magudulela said the arrest came after they received a tip-off about an unlicensed firearm at the hostel two days after the incident. “Police followed up on the information,” he said. “During the search, a revolver with six rounds of live ammunition was found under the suspect’s bed, who confirmed he lived by himself.” He said the suspect was arrested and investigations revealed it was the gun that had been stolen from the security guard. The suspect was arrested, appeared in the Springs Magistrates Court last Thursday, and was expected to make a second appearance soon. Colonel Mareketle Thobejane praised the work conducted by the officers who made it a point to rid the community of dangerous weapons and perpetrators of crime.
