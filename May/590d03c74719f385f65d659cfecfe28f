Jose Mourinho has been appointed Roma head coach on a
three-year deal set to begin at the start of next season. Mourinho was fired by Tottenham in April after just 17
months in charge of the English Premier League. The announcement of his
appointment by Roma came just hours after the club confirmed that current boss
Paulo Fonseca would depart at the end of the current campaign. It will be the Portuguese manager's second spell in Serie
A, after he spent two seasons with Inter Milan before leaving to join Real Madrid
in 2010.
