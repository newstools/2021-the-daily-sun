Chippa Mpengesi, owner of Chippa United, has done it again! He has fired coach Vladislav Heric after having been in charge of six matches, SunSport has reliably learnt. Their DStv Premiership season is now left with two matches to go, and Mpengesi has already pulled the trigger. According to our impeccable source, the coach was told to pack his bags and leave. Efforts to solicit comment from the 54-year-old Serbian coach proved fruitless as he didn't respond on his mobile phone. Chippa are on the brink of relegation, placed 15th on the log with paltry 25 points from 28 matches. "He was just a complete disaster. He didn't see eye to eye with the club chairman who got fed up with his antics," our source said. Chippa are away to fellow strugglers Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) on 2 June and end their season at home to SuperSport United on 5 June. Last season, they managed to save their top-flight status on the last day of the season, thanks to the astute guidance of coach Clinton Larsen. Again, this season the Gqeberha based club are skating on thin ice. In their last two league games, The Chilli Boys failed to get any points, and Heric said their failure to win the Nedbank Cup, which they lost 1-0 against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in the final, has affected them mentally. Talking after a 2-1 defeat by Celtic on Tuesday, Heric said: â€œThese are the consequences of losing the final, they (players) were down they have not recovered (from losing the final)."
