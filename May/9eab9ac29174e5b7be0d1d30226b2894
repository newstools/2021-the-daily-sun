A security
guard who allegedly stole several millions of rands belonging to his employer
is expected to bring a formal bail application this week. Josiah
Marietta Lekgoathi, 45, made his first appearance in the Kempton Park
Magistrates Court on Monday. Lekgoathi
faces a charge of theft. It is
alleged that on 5 April, Lekgoathi was on duty with his two other colleagues
conducting money drop-offs and pickups from various ATMs around Selby,
Johannesburg. "The
trio later returned to the company base in Edenvale with the remaining money.
One guard was dropped outside the entrance while the driver proceeded to park
the armoured vehicle inside. Lekgoathi then allegedly loaded the money bag in
his private vehicle and left the premises without being searched. He never
returned to work," Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Philani Nkwalase
said. A case of
theft was reported to the Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation unit. "A
team of investigators traced and arrested Lekgoathi on Saturday. His vehicle
that was allegedly used in the commission of the crime was seized," said
Nkwalase. Lekgoathi
is expected back in court later this week for a formal bail application. SOURCE:
