MOST people end up getting into debt or going on strike when their salaries don’t get them through the month. But friends Moleboheng Mabena (28) and Mauna Phaswa (26) found a side hustle. The two women from Diepkloof, Soweto, started a business called Mau-Events to boost their income. Moleboheng told Daily Sun: “A few years ago, I couldn’t afford most of the things I wanted because my salary was not enough. But things have since changed for the better. A friend of mine had the same challenge, which brought us closer together. We started discussing different ideas to find out what kind of business we wanted to run.”  The company, which is now two years old, specialises in organising events, gifts, flowers and decorations. Customers use their services for events like reunions, weddings and graduations. Mauna said: “We work for different companies but we use our weekends to provide services to our customers. If one person has a day off during the week, she will oversee the running of the company. “Like any other company, our challenge was with transport when it came to delivering equipment and gifts. Now we’ve sorted it out and can transport anything we need at any time. So we no longer arrive late at events. “To add value and attach memories to our services, we make sure we personalise our gifts so our clients can see how much we value them.” Mau-Events relies on word of mouth and social media to get new clients. Currently, the company only hires part-time staff for bigger events.
