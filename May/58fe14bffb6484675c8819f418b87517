THE discovery of the body of an unknown woman left residents in Inanda shocked. The body that had bruises and dressed in a stripped dress was found by a resident who was walking passed the bushes on Wednesday afternoon, 26 May. The resident then alerted other residents about the discovery and they called cops. A resident told Daily Sun that nobody in their area knew the woman. “We suspect she was killed somewhere else and then dumped here,” said the resident. Another resident said this is the first time such an incident happened in their area. “This is terrifying and we fear for our lives. We’ve never seen such here. Although the body was partly decomposed, we could see that she was badly beaten. Some people were afraid to even look at her because of how she was,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that an inquest docket was opened at Inanda Police Station. “A complaint of an unknown body of a woman was received at Inanda Police Station. The cops proceeded to Congo area where a decomposed body of an unknown woman believed to be in her 20s was found in the bushes,” said Mbele.
