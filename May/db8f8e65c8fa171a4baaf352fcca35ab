AL AHLY president  Mahmoud El Khatib showered coach Pitso Mosimane with praise after the former Bafana Bafana coach guided the club to victory in the  Caf Super Cup on Friday. Mohamed Sherif and Salah Mohsen’s second half goals handed the Egyptian giants their seventh Super Cup title after beating Confederation Cup winners RS Berkane 2-0 at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha. Ahly, who are through to the semifinals of this year’s Champions League, were dominant against their Confederation Cup counterparts, especially in the second half. They ensured Mosimane won his second continental title since joining the Cairo giants last October from Mzansi champions Mamelodi Sundowns. Mosimane won the Champions League and guided the Red Devils to triumph in the Egyptian Cup. “I stand before you in peace and in pride. I saw a diamond in South Africa and I went alone to bring it over here, whilst no one believed in Pitso Mosimane. The board was amazed by this move,” said the club boss. “The first time I saw my diamond my team was six years without winning the Caf Champions League, when I brought him over to Cairo the doors of Africa opened and he brought to my hands the desired medal of Africa. “I know a lot of mourning voices back home in Egypt are now angry because today Pitso Mosimane has once again delivered not one, not two, not three, but the fourth title to my hands. Now he does not owe me anything, I am the one who owes him a worthy contract.” Mosimane resigned as Sundowns coach last September and signed a two-year deal with Ahly. Now Mosimane can look forward to getting that deal extended. “Since no club has ever defeated Ahly by 5-0 in the Champions League (Sundowns thumped them 5-0 in the quarterfinals in 2019 which was the biggest loss in Ahly's history), only Pitso Mosimane did,” added the Ahly president. “When I hire, I hire the brain, not the skin colour. I know Qatar has seen my diamond today, hopefully, there are no thieves around to steal it.”
