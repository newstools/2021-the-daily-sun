RESIDENTS are still in shock after they discovered a dug-up grave in Orpen Gate RDPs in Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Sunday, 9 May. They called the cops, who found human remains and hair on top of the grave, as well as a coffin handle not far from the grave. It’s not yet known who the grave belongs to. Residents believe the grave was dug up for muthi purposes. A villager told Daily Sun: “The grave was dug up by wicked people for muthi purposes. It appears they had time at night to do this horrible thing unseen. Our dead loved ones are no longer safe. “We wish the police leave no stone unturned until the perpetrators are found and brought to book.” Traditional healer Annuary Ndlovu said this was the evil deed of heartless people who believe human body parts could make them rich or bring them luck. “It’s taboo to dig up the dead. Curses might follow them. So it is important to respect the dead as their families did a ritual when they buried them,” said Ndlovu. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that police received a complaint about a violated grave. “Police quickly attended to the scene. Upon inspection, cops found human hair next to the grave, human remains on top of it and a coffin handle a few metres away from the grave. “The human remains are currently kept in a government mortuary,” said Hlathi. Anyone with information should contact Lieutenant-Colonel Albert Manzini on 082 469 1031.
