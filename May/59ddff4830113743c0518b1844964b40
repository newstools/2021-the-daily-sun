THE talent of Sphelele Mkhulise is undoubted. The midfielder star has been a revelation for Mamelodi Sundowns since he joined the senior team three seasons ago, having forced his way into a star-studded Brazilians side. But Pitso Mosimane is not surprised by Mkhulise’s rise, having seen him develop during the former’s reign at Sundowns. “Sphelele Mkhulise is a wonderful player. He is similar to Kante (N’golo) and Iniesta (Andres),” said Mosimane. “He is a promising young man. I was behind his promotion to the first team, and today he is showing his quality.” Mosimane will be wary of the twinkled-toed attacker when Sundowns host Al Ahly in their Caf Champions League return leg at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday. Mkhulise held his own against the Egyptian giants and he is most likely to get another run.
