She said the cops arrived at the scene and arrested the deceased’s friend who was a passenger. “The deceased approached the officers to establish why his friend was being arrested. Another police van arrived with two police officers, who allegedly started to beat the deceased and later arrested him. “The deceased and his friend were taken to Honeydew Police Station in two different police vans, where the police allegedly continued assaulting the pair,” Cola said. It is alleged that the cops assaulted Thando until he collapsed inside the cell. “The other detained friend called paramedics and they certified him dead inside the police cell. “Ipid investigated this death in the police custody case, the outcome of the post-mortem confirmed that Thando died due to blunt force injuries in the head,” Cola added.
