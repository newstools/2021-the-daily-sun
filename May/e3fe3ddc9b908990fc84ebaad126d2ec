TWO patients were killed at FH Odendaal Hospital in Limpopo on Tuesday morning after a fire started in the Covid-19 ward. Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba told eNCA that one of the cubicles housing a Covid-19 ward was burnt down completely. “The nurses did their level best because they were able to evacuate all those patients who were admitted, even in the other close-by wards. “Unfortunately, even though they tried to evacuate all the patients, there are two patients who died,” she said. Ramathuba said one of the patients who died in the fire was critically ill, while another patient was an inmate who was also very ill. “It’s quite sad because we tried to rescue all our patients. We’d like to send our sincere condolences to their families,” said the MEC. The cause of the fire has not been established at the moment. Meanwhile, Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital resumed its activities on Monday, 3 May after some parts of the hospital were gutted by a fire late last month.
