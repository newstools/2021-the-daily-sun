AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has given credit to his players and technical team after winning DStv Quarter three Innovation. Usuthu were rewarded after their awe-inspiring performances during the eight-match block in the quarter in which they collected 20 points from six wins and two draws. The run saw them climbing the log and establishing themselves as title contenders. They are second in the log standings with 50 points after 26 matches. They are a point adrift of Mamelodi Sundowns, who are leading the standings. “I would like to thank the DStv Premiership officials for recognizing us as Q3 winners. Hopefully there’s many more to come,” McCarthy said on Tuesday. “We are happy to receive this award. It has been hard work for everyone. I would like to thank the players first of all. For their hard work, dedication, sacrifice I am really grateful and happy for them that they were able to win this.” “All the hard work is paying off eventually. Technical team I am grateful for you as well and the management. Mr Manzini Zungu for the leadership, for allowing me to assemble the team I want.” AmaZulu will not be in action this week. They will only return next Tuesday when they host Baroka FC at King Zwelithini Stadium (3pm).
