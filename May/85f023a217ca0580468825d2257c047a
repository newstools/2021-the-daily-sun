GAUTENG is officially experiencing a third wave of Covid-19 infections. Joburg areas such as Sandton and Alexandra have been identified as hot spots. On Saturday, 15 May, cops conducted Operation Okae Molao in Alexandra, where they had their hands full getting people off the streets after curfew. But in some areas it was business as usual, with taverns operating after curfew. Mvuleni Tavern in Stjwetla squatter camp was packed with patrons who didn’t adhere to Covid-19 regulations. Their fun came to an end when cops, led by Gauteng commissioner General Elias Mawela and Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko, descended on Sjwetla. The tavern was shut down for operating after curfew and without a liquor licence. The booze was confiscated and the owner of the establishment arrested. Raymond Martin, head of the Gauteng Liquor Board, said the document the owner presented to them was not authentic. “It’s stamped 2020 and these permits were issued around 2006,” said Martin. “For him to produce it with a 2020 stamp clearly indicates this document is fraudulent. “That’s why the alcohol was confiscated. He’s trading illegally.” Mazibuko said: “It’s totally embarrassing to think that region E has the highest numbers when it comes to infections. “You see a lot of people wandering about without any masks. They’re sitting in taverns and some are gambling on street corners. “You ask them where their masks are and they say they’ve forgotten them at home. Masks are now part and parcel of our lives.” She urged people to wear their masks in public to curb the spike in infections. “You’re not doing it for us. You’re doing it for yourself,” she said.
