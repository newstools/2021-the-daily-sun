THE founder and owner of Slay Queen Cleaning Services, Refiloe Jawa, has come out guns blazing against women who apparently want her to link them up with rich men. She fired all cylinders and labelled those wanting men from her the worst kind of hypocrites. Jawa vented her anger on a video posted on social media platform, TikTok. Not holding back, Jawa said: “You are the worst kind of hypocrites. And full of s**t. When I officiated my business to the public, people crucified me, mostly women. “Now the very same people are reaching out, asking me to hook them up with rich men.” Pictures of the sexy slay queen cleaner had set tongues wagging. Others couldn’t wait to get her cleaning services while some suggested there was more to the cleaning than meets the eye. She had previously clarified that all she did was clean, and lashed out at a woman who apparently pretended to be her and demanded R1 000 for sex. Visibly angry, Jawa further said: “When you want to offer your vagina to rich men, it is no longer prostitution. It is a hook up. If you want a man with money, wash your thighs, put make-up on and smell nice. I run a cleaning company, not an escort agency,” she said.
