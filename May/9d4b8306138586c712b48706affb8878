WINTER is a dry and dull season. One just has to step outside and all they see is brown plantation and gloomy skies. In addition to the bitter cold weather patterns, our skin tends to get battered with dryness in winter. According to many dermatologists, cold air, dry indoor heat, low humidity levels, and harsh winter wind can all affect your skin’s moisture. Known as xerosis, symptoms of dry skin can range in severity and look different depending on the area of your body that’s affected. According to Healthline magazine, these are some tips for keeping your skin radiant during winter: 1. Moisturise after washing Every time you wash your face, hands, or body, you strip your skin of its natural oils. Since these oils help to lock in moisture, it’s vital to replace them. That’s why it’s important to use a moisturiser any time you wash your skin, especially in winter. 2. Apply sunscreen Even in winter, harmful UV light can still stress your skin’s moisture barrier, which is vital for maintaining skin health and hydration. 3. Adjust your skin care routine If the skin on your face seems to be especially sensitive or irritated due to the dry winter air, you may want to consider simplifying your skin care routine for the time being.
