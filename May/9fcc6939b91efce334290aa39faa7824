PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation in yet another family meeting tonight, 30 May, at 7pm. Tonightâ€™s address comes as the country enters the third wave of Covid-19. According to the rumour mill, the president will place the country on a harsher level 2 lockdown from the current relaxed level 1. Over the past two weeks, the recorded Covid-19 infections have been rising, and we are now peaking at 4 500 infections per day. Harsher lockdown levels have proven to be effective for the reduction of infections, but they had devastating effects on the economy, forcing the closure of many businesses and mass job losses. The president will give an update on recent developments in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
