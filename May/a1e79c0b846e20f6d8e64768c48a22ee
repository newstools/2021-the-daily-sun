Bafana Bafana will play two friendlies in June against Uganda's Cranes and Zebras of Botswana, SunSport understands. Head coach Hugo Broos has requested two friendlies after Fifa and Caf moved Africa's 2022 World Cup qualifiers from next month to September. These matches against the Cranes and the Zebras will help Broos assess his players as he starts a new challenge ahead of the World Cup qualifiers. However, Broos, who won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2017 with Cameroon, wonâ€™t be on the bench for these two friendly matches. This is because the 69-year-old will have to go back to his homeland, Belgium, for his second Covid-19 vaccination. He confirmed that his assistant coach Cedomir "Cede" Janevski, a former Yugoslavia and Macedonia international, who is currently head coach of Olympiakos Nicosia in Cyprus, will take charge. Cede is expected to travel to South Africa after his club's match against Anorthosis Famagusta in their final Cypriot Cup this weekend. A second assistant, who Broos has said will be from Mzansi but is yet to be identified, will work with Janevski to take charge of these two friendly matches during June's international break. Broos promised to give it his best to see Bafana qualify for the World Cup in Qatar. Bafana are in Group G, together with Ghana, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe.
