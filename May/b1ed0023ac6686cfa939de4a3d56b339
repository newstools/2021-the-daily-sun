Victory for Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) has earned the players, technical team and all employees of the club with a whopping R7 million in bonuses. The club's Liaison Manager, Rufus Matsena, has confirmed that their players, technical team and entire staff will split a hefty 100% of the Nedbank Cup prize money, which is R7m, among themselves. "They deserve it, they worked very hard for this honour. The chairman has been clear that he will not take a cent from it but the entire staff will share the money equally," Matsena said. The PSL rookies broke their record books by clinching the important cup that secured a place for them in the 2021-22 Caf Confederation Cup season. They pipped Chippa United 1-0 at the Free State Stadium at the weekend, with a scorcher from Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo. But the road to the Confed Cup will not be an easy one, however, their millionaire boss, Abram Sello, starts a habit that his players and staff are not starving and has been paying them well. This will surely motivate players and technical staff to work hard in their efforts to win more trophies and earn big. But the trick now is on the DStv Premiership where their PSL status is not safe, placed 14th on the log with 25 points from 25 games - one more than 15th placed Chippa, and seven above Black Leopards who are propping at the foot of the log. Retaining their PSL status might as well earn them more money, depending on how chairman will welcome their effort.
