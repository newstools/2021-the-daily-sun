A two-year investigation by the Hawks has ended with the arrest of a teacher for allegedly being part of a syndicate in Middleberg that sells fraudulent Eskom prepaid electricity vouchers. Phumzile Constance Masimula, 42, was arrested by the Mpumalanga Hawks on Thursday. This brings to four the number of people arrested as part of Operation Mahala which began in 2019 after a whistleblower alerted the authorities to the syndicate's alleged unlawful dealings. According to the Hawks, investigators found that the group was allegedly selling prepaid electricity vouchers using unauthorised vending machines at low prices. Case "The team went undercover and monitored transactions with the unsuspecting targets, thereby building a watertight case against them," said Mpumalanga Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi. The other alleged syndicate members - Anna Nelisiwe Mahlangu, 35, Jan Mandla Mnguni, 47, and Zodwa Hilda Msiza, 39 - were arrested last October on similar charges. Their arrest, which was carried out by a multidisciplinary team that included the Kwamhlanga Local Criminal Record Centre and Eskom forensics - aimed to put an end to what is evidently a disturbing trend in some parts of Mpumalanga. Sekgotodi said some of the items confiscated during the arrests included diaries with a list of clients and their meter numbers. The three were released on R3 500 bail each last year. Masimula is expected to appear in the Siyabuswa Magistrate's Court on 25 June along with her three co-accused. She has been released on a warning. The head of the Hawks in Mpumalanga, Major-General Zodwa Mokoena, welcomed the arrest and urged residents to stop buying electricity from unauthorised vendors.
