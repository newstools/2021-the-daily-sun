Raising a child doesn’t only involve providing for them. It includes guiding them to become responsible adults. Parents and guardians must be careful not to do things they forbid kids from doing. Kids never see trouble in doing exactly what adults do. You can’t teach your kids that crime doesn’t pay when you support them with the proceeds of crime. Earning a living through corruption is not good for their development. There’s always a greater chance that your kids will emulate you and start by stealing from schoolmates. People who make a living through crime, as evidenced by the characters we see in soapies, are a bad influence. Some kids today envy the lives of hardened criminals who drive flashy cars. TV dramas ought to promote people who make an honest living. They should have storylines where people start businesses honestly until they’ve built big empires. Those who raise kids with dirty money mustn’t be surprised when the kids become thugs. Or criminals who torment them and become a nuisance to society. It’s not difficult to act responsibly and legally in the presence of children. Let’s set a good example to young people. That’s how we can shape good leaders. Letter by N V Makgoka
