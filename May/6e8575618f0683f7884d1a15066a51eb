THERE has never been scientific proof that churches are spreading Covid-19. This was according to Incredible Happenings Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng, who was reacting to the country going to alert level 2. “It only happened at one church in Bloemfontein because there were tourists there,” he said. Meanwhile, backdoor booze sellers were left disappointed when it emerged that alcohol would not be banned. Madisa Ndwandwe (31) from a hostel in Soweto said he was praying for level 3 and an alcohol ban. Mzomuhle Mbatha (28), another black market seller, said he wouldn’t stop praying for stricter regulations. Malibongwe Mnguni (35) from Dobsonville said during the last ban, he was able to build a two-roomed house. However, buyers said they didn’t want another ban. Musa Madondo (40) said: “The backdoor sellers are very disrespectful and greedy.” Another boozer, Manqoba Ziqubu (36) said: “I spent so much money on backdoor sellers last time. I don’t wish to go back there.”
