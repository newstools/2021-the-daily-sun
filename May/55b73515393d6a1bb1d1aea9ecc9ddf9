CHILD rapist Bokang Tamane has been handed down a hefty jail sentence! He’ll spend the rest of his life behind bars for raping an eight-year-old girl and attempting to rape an eight-year-old boy. Tamane from Lady Grey in the Eastern Cape allegedly approached children playing and pretended to seek help to carry his luggage from a hiking spot on 18 July 2017 at about 3pm. Captain Ursula Roelofse said Tamane took them to an open field about 4km away and tried to rape the young boy, who was eight at the time. “The young girl tried to run away but the suspect left the boy and started to rape her. The kids managed to run back home and reported the incident to the police,” said Roelofse. A case of rape was opened and Tamane was arrested two days later. He was sentenced to direct life imprisonment for rape and attempted rape. Both counts will run concurrently, said Roelofse. Acting district police commissioner, Brigadier Rudolph Adolph, congratulated the collaboration between police and the NPA which led to the lengthy prison term. “The sentence is the outcome unwavering commitment of the police in the fight against crime against women and children, as well as the hard work of the investigating officer and other specialised disciplines of the police and NPA.”
