I HAVE always wondered why sportsmen and women wear specific socks when they compete. Whether above the knee or a bit over the ankle, socks seem to play an integral role in almost all sporting codes. This then made sense when a new study reported that more orgasms are achieved when one is wearing socks during sex. WATCH: TEARS OVER TLOF TLOF ZAKA! Come to think of it, sex is also a sport played in the comfort of almost any pitch in nature and the above revelation makes perfect sex, right? According to the Deccan Chronicle Lifestyle magazine, a recent study has come out with a revelation that wearing socks while poking can help couples have better orgasms and made the experience in bed even more amazing. The study said that 80% of the couples said they reached orgasm while wearing socks and only 50% of couples climaxed without their socks on. The study seems to suggest that by keeping people warm during sex, socks dilate blood vessels in the feet and improve blood flow, which is instrumental in enhancing sexual intercourse and facilitating a good orgasm. Furthermore, with some people having a fetish for toes, keeping your socks on can also be a good idea to hide those hideous feet.
