PASTOR Mpfariseni Mukhuba and her six co-accused returned to the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto on Thursday, 6 May. They are accused of assaulting Metro police officers who were called to the area following a noise complaint. Scores of church members descended to the court in support of their church leader and fellow congregants. They held various placards which read: “Touch not God’s anointed, don’t kill us for serving God and an injury to one, is an injury to all.” The church also had a seven camera crew and an outside broadcast van to document activities outside the court.  The matter against the pastor and her congregants was postponed to 2 June for the disclosure of the docket and issuing of a certificate that will determine the readiness of the trial. The case was initially postponed to 1 June, but the defence asked for it be postponed to 2 June.  “Accused one has a church service that day. She will not be available that day,” said the defence. The magistrate said the state was given a lengthy postponement and therefore the state has no reason for a delay when the case comes back to court.  The pastor and her co-accused were also charged with malicious damage to property and public violence.
