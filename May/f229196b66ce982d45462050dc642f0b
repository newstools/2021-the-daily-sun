Bafana Bafana coach, Hugo Broos, is a team player and didn't make it a secret that he will need support from South African coaches, more especially David Notoane who is favoured to assisting him. In his first interview in the country on Tuesday on SABC's Morning Live, Broos outlined bits of his plans and made a commitment to watch weekend's matches, as he familiarises himself with the local football. Broos arrived in South Africa on Monday night to get down to business of kickstarting plans to have Bafana qualify for the the 2022 Fifa World Cup, with qualifiers starting in September. Broos doesn’t come to South Africa clueless, he faced Bafana twice during the 2017 Afcon qualifying campaign, though in both matches home and away. But based on what the former Cameroon coach saw, he is excited about the challenges that lie ahead. “We (Cameroon) were in the same Afcon qualifier group (with Gambia and Mauritania) and it gave me a good opportunity to know a bit about South Africa,” said Broos. Bafana failed to qualify for that Afcon finals as they finished third in Group M, with seven points after six games - one behind second-placed Mauritania and seven points behind group winners, and eventual then Afcon winners Cameroon. “But I have to be honest also, for the moment, I need to have more information about this team,” added Broos. “I will need my South African assistant coach because he knows the team better than I do, and we’ll make some decisions. “For me this is very important. Secondly, I’ll watch some games (the PSL) Tuesday and this is important and then I will analyse the list of players in other countries. We will see who they are and whether they are in big leagues or small teams that are not top level, we have to see them.” Broos was given the list of over 60 South African players by Safa president Danny Jordaan who are plying their trade abroad to follow them, as the former JS Kabylie coach looks to rebuild the squad.
