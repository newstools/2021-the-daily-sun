MFESANE Clinic in Crossroads in Cape Town has been closed after patients and staff members were robbed last week. Health MMC Zahid Badroodien said the clinic will remain closed pending a security assessment. “Patients will be advised once the opening date is finalised,” he said. He said patients were redirected to Phumlani Clinic in Crossroads. “The violence levelled against City of Cape Town health staff and the continuous threat of bodily harm, and trauma inflicted on those on the front line and their patients, has reached untenable levels,” he said. In Samora Machel squatter camp, Weltervreden Valley Clinic remains closed after staff were robbed at gunpoint more than a month ago. Mzamomhle Clinic in Browns Farm is under threat as well. Patients have been robbed on many occasions. “The Khayelitsha environmental health office in Harare is temporarily closed after burglars made off with computers, a microwave, two television sets, a laptop and PPEs,” he told the People’s Paper. As a result, the environmental health office won’t be able to render any services for some time. Badroodien urged residents to speak out, saying the situation couldn’t be allowed to continue. “It’s our communities who suffer, yet the perpetrators who attack and terrorise our staff come from these communities,” he said. Resident Zingiswa Makana (45) said: “The criminals who rob clinics are sick in the head! “Surely even their families go to the clinics they rob for medical attention.” Another concerned resident told Daily Sun it was time that communities fought back.
