ENOCH Mpianzi’s family and the Gauteng Department of Education have reached a settlement. Thr settlement comes a year and a half after Enoch was swept away by the Crocodile River. The Mpianzi family sued the Gauteng Department of Education for R10 million. According to News24, the settlement was reached on “undisclosed terms” with the boy’s family and all parties involved. But the family also wants justice to be served as they wait for the criminal case to get underway. A forensic report that was released by Harris Nupen Molebatsi Attorneys last year recommended that Nyati Bush and River Break Lodge should be held responsible and liable for their negligent and reckless actions which contributed to the death of Parktown Boys’ High School pupil. It found that the campsite was reckless in allowing the pupils to go into the river without life jackets and that there were not enough co-ordinators during the water activity. The damning report into Enoch’s drowning broadly found the school principal, Malcolm Williams, seven teachers who accompanied over 200 boys to camp, the department, and lodge were negligent and reckless. The report found that Williams was negligent in not ensuring an accurate roll call list was in place and had also been negligent in not ensuring the boys were safe during the water activity. The school was found to have been negligent in allowing the water exercise to go ahead, while the SGB was found liable for allowing the camp without any authorisation.
