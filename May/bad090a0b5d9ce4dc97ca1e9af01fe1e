TWO people died in a crash on the N1 in Beaufort West after two trucks collided earlier on Tuesday morning, 25 May. The Western Cape Traffic spokesman, Jandre Bakker, said the two trucks caught fire after a head-on collision leading to road closures in the area. “The N1 between Beaufort West and Leeu Gamka is currently closed following a head-on collision between two heavy motor vehicles. Currently, two fatalities have been recorded. The trucks are still alight, so we can’t ascertain whether there are passengers as well.” taxi driver Mthuthuzeli Rungqu (34) said he was delayed for two hours on his way to Cape Town from the Eastern Cape due to the traffic on the N1. He said he saw the wreckage of the two trucks on the side of the road. “From how the wreckage looked, no person would come out of it alive. The crash was horrible because the vehicles involved are both heavy vehicles,” he said. Rungqu said they always struggle with trucks on the highway, especially in the middle of the night and early in the morning. “They drive in the middle of the road. As a taxi driver, you have to drive in the yellow line when you are close to them just to give them way. “Whatever that happened, I think the government must ban trucks from driving over night,” he said.
