Even Benni McCarthy is aware that their 1-0 loss to Baroka FC on Monday has cost them dearly in their ambition to wrestle the Premiership title from Mamelodi Sundowns. The loss left Sundowns needing two points to have an unassailable lead against AmaZulu, which will well but declare them champions with three matches spared. PERMUTATIONS: 1. Sundowns just need to beat SuperSport United on 26 May to have an unassailable 60 points, with three matches still left against Swallows FC (29 May), Bloemfontein Celtic (2 June) and Cape Town City on 5 June. Even if they can draw against SuperSport and Swallows would mean they have run away with it as they would be on 59, the only mark that AmaZulu, second on the log, can finish in. Sundowns for the next two weeks will be in Africa against African Club of the Century Al Ahly in the two-legged quarter-final. 2. AmaZulu are left with three matches against Orlando Pirates (27 May), Swallows FC (2June) and Maritzburg United on 5 June to end their term. Victory in all the remaining matches can only boost them to 59 points, but their goal-difference is far lesser than that of Sundowns. However, should AmaZulu lose their next match then they would be out of the race. 3. For AmaZulu to stand in contention, they will all but need to win their remaining matches and hope Sundowns trip on a hurdle somewhere and they can pounce. They cannot afford not even a draw. It's well documented that AmaZulu have over stepped their ambitions of a top four matches, but being this closer would mean they have overachieved. 4. Third-placed Golden Arrows and Orlando Pirates, both on 43 points from 26 matches, can only end 55, a mark that Sundowns have over-stepped with two points. This completely rules them out of any slip chance of moving to the top. Arrows are this Wednesday playing against Maritzburg United in a KZN derby while Pirates, held goalless by Stellenbosch on Tuesday, will next be in league action on 27 May against AmaZulu. Pirates will this weekend be kicking off their knockout phase of the Caf Confederation Cup quarter-final agaist Raja Casablanca away on Sunday
