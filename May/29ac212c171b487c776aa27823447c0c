They say dynamite comes in small packages and the greatest fire is often started by the smallest of sparks. While a lot is often said about size and especially small things, we often forget how potent they can become. Take the 4-5 as an example, one often assumes bigger is better but different strokes apply for different folks. Many sex experts agree the smallest of 4-5s can cause a lot of sexual damage. According to the latest research, men with shorter 4-5s experience erections that increase penis size by 86%. For longer 4-5s, the growth is around 47%. Furthermore, the term small is relative when it comes to the 4-5. According to the Boston Medical Group, a small 4-5 is more of a mindset than an actuality. A large cool drink at a McDonald’s in France is tiny compared to a large one in the US, for example, where the size is usually considered medium. So, these are the things to take into consideration before applying terms such as small and large to your body parts. According to sex experts, many women opt for the normal sized 4-5 which is 6-9cm long. Men with a “normal” or small sized 4-5 tend to become more sexually creative and tend to provide the best orgasms. So, small is the new big right?
