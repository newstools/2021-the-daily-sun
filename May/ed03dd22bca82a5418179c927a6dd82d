ONE more alleged gang member in Zandspruit who was in hospital has died, and three suspects have been arrested. This was confirmed to Daily Sun by police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele on Thursday morning, 20 May. He said the number of deceased from Wednesday’s mob justice was now five. “The situation is calm right now. Members are on the ground working hard, hence the arrest of three men suspected of being instigators. Police will continue to monitor the area,” said Makhubele. The ANC has called on Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko and Police Minister Bheki Cele to look into the situation in Zandspruit. They urged residents to work with police and not take the law into their own hands. This after the brutal attack and killing of the alleged gang members on Wednesday, with four more people still critical in hospital. Although the community expressed no remorse because they said they were tired of living in fear, their actions have been condemned. Greater Joburg regional secretary Dada Morero said it was unlawful for residents to take the law into their own hands. “Once they’ve identified perpetrators, they need to inform the police and let them do their job. We understand their frustration, but nothing justifies the loss of life,” said Morero. He said no violence should be tolerated and the police should work hard in trying to find whoever instigated the inhumane act. “All ANC zonal leaders should work closely with the community policing forum and police to avoid a repeat of such incidents.” Morero sent his condolences to the families of the deceased and wished those in hospital a speedy recovery.
