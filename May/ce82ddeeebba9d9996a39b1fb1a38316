ORLANDO Pirates captain, Happy Jele, says it is beyond his control whether the club extend his contract or not when it expires next month. Jele is the longest serving member in this Pirates side, and was given a one-year deal at the beginning of the season, which must have rang alarm bells for him. The 34-year-old is currently injured and last featured for Pirates against Mamelodi Sundowns’ 4-0 loss, in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals at Loftus Stadium on 15 April. “I have been with this team for quite some time, and obviously the decision has to come from the management,” said Jele, who made his PSL debut for Pirates against Maritzburg in 2006. “If they want me to remain at the club, I’ll do that. But I’m hoping that I’ll stay.” During his 15 years at Pirates, Jele has won a plethora of trophies. Two league titles, three MTN8 cups, two Nedbank Cups and one Telkom Knockout. On top of that, the Mpumalanga-born defender just need one appearance to equal the record of the legendary William Okpara, who made 375 starts. Jele, who has missed the last nine games in all competitions, has 374 starts. This record has not been broken for years as Okpara, who won the Caf Champions League with Pirates in 1995, retired in the 2004-05 season. With four league matches left, it is not clear when Jele will be back in the side. But Jele, who started his career as a flying right-back before he was converted to centre-back after losing some yards in his legs, is not thinking about records. “I’m not frustrated, it’s God’s timing,” said Jele about injuries. “I have been injured, there’s nothing I can do. Now I’m concentrating on healing, not breaking records or anything. I want to be fine and come back again like I have done previously.”
