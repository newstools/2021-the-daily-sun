METROBUS commuters remain in limbo after the state-owned bus company withdrew all workers from duty. The Joburg bus service said it withdrew staff due to fear of violence by striking members of the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (Demawusa). Commuters told Daily Sun yesterday they had no warning and ended up not having enough time to make alternative transport arrangements. Pupil Colbet Mahlatjie said: “The strike has affected me badly as I have to spend money I don’t have to use taxis. “I have to ask my parents for money, despite them already having paid for the bus tag.” Vincent Mawelela said: “Drivers need to think about their safety but at the same time, they must think of the public. “We didn’t get communication from Metrobus about the strike. I learnt about it on social media.” Mfiso Mdladla said: “We were not informed. The whole thing caught us off guard.”  Nomvewlo Mkhize said using the bus was more convenient than taxis as she didn’t have to walk a long distance to change taxis. “I hope the strike ends soon but I also understand why they are striking,” she said. She said she didn’t know about the strike and loaded all her money on to her monthly bus tag.  Demawusa, which has received support from other unions, vowed to continue striking until their demands were met or they were invited to negotiate with Metrobus. Metrobus spokesman Goodwill Shivuri said they suspended services due to threats received by some drivers. He said there was no meeting planned with the union. He said in the meantime, operations would remain suspended and they’d communicate when it was safe to operate again. He said they shared information on their social media pages, website and other media platforms.
