KAIZER Chiefs have taken a massive step towards the semi-finals of the Caf Champions League. This after they stunned Simba SC 4-0 at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Samir Nurkovic was the star of the show as he bagged a brace while Erick Mathoho and Leonardo Castro chipped in with one goal each. The result was huge boost for the Glamour Boys who have endured a disastrous season domestically where they are struggling to qualify for the top eight. However, they have been a different animal in continental football, making history by reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League. They are now one match away from reaching the last four of the competition for the first time in the club’s history. Mathoho gave Amakhosi a bright start to the match when he headed in the opener in the 6th minute of the match. That was only the beginning of the carnage as Nurkovic doubled Amakhosi’s lead in the 34th minute with a thumping header. As good as the start was, Amakhosi were not done yet as Nurkovic doubled up in the 57th minute with a sweet volley. His strike partner, Castro, got in on the action as he put the final nail in Simba’s coffin on the night with yet another header. Amakhosi will now look to finish the job when they travel to Tanzania for the second leg next Saturday.
