COPS in Cape Town are investigating after a decomposed body was found in an open field in Siteview, Grabouw, on Sunday. According to a resident, the body was found when a passerby saw a dog feasting on the body, from a shallow grave. The passerby was walking in the secluded area when he saw a dog eating something and decided to check what it was, only to find a human body. “The body seems like that of a female person who was wearing slippers. I did not sleep properly after seeing that body and I don’t think I will ever erase it from my mind. People are shocked because it is not known whose body it is and what transpired. It is also shocking to see a dog feasting on a human being,” said Tonderai Dube, who lived close to where the incident occurred. He said when he arrived at the scene, cops had not arrived and he managed to see the state of the body. “The person who saw this incident ran and told community members who then went to witness the shocking scene. The body was in a decomposing state and the person could not be identified. I have never witnessed such a scary scene in my life,” said Dube. Cops were still investigating the incident and a murder case had been opened. Spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said no arrests had been made yet. “Grabouw police have opened a case of murder after an unidentified decomposed body was found buried in an open field in Siteview, Grabouw, yesterday morning. The gender will be determined once a postmodern is conducted. The circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation with no arrests so far,” she said.
