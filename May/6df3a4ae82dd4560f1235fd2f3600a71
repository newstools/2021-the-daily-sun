IF you’ve ever been to Limpopo, then you know that the residents in that province party differently to the rest of Mzansi. Their weddings are also as lavish as their houses, with the music they play, called tsa manyalo. It’s not common to see people blessing those getting married with building material. But for this couple, it was a wedding day of surprises. In a video that has gone viral, a group of people can be seen dancing at a wedding carrying doors and window frames to gift the newly-weds. People on social media were surprised by the gifts the couple received. Sharon Mafanato II said: “After the wedding, move out. So thoughtful.” Moloko Dorcus Mashalane said: “This is awesome.” Mogau Ledingoana said: “This is actually a very brilliant idea. You can’t get married and still be staying at home. You need to move.”
