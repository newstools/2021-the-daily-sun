PLUCKY Bloemfontein Celtic came from 2-0 down to hold Kaizer Chiefs to a 2-2 draw against in a DStv Premiership clash at the Petrus Molemela stadium on Saturday afternoon. Happy Mashiane and Eric Mathoho had given Amakhosi an early two-goal advantage but Neo Maema and Victor Letsoalo who converted from the spot kick ensured that Celtic secure a point. The result does little to help either team as both teams remains out of the top-eight bracket. Chiefs are in position nine with 29 points after 25 league matches. Siwelele Sa Masele are in position 11, with 27 points from 27 matches. They are two points behind Chiefs. The game started at a high tempo and Chiefs took the lead in the third minute when Mashiane curled in a left-footed free-kick to beat Celtic goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane. Amakhosi doubled their lead 10 minutes later when Mathoho rose highest in the box to head in Lebogang Manyama's pin-point cross. Celtic pulled one goal back in the 22nd minute when Maema drove through the middle and played a neat one-two with Ndumiso Mabena and slotted past Daniel Akpeyi. The home team did have an opportunity to draw level just before the halftime break but Letsoalo saw his effort tipped over the cross-bar by Akpeyi. Mabokgwane came to his team's rescue just after the interval, diving smartly to save from midfielder Kearyn Baccus. Celic were awarded a penalty in the 54th minute when Siyabonga Ngezana clumsily brought down Tebogo Potsane leaving the referee no option but to point to the spot. There were chances created in the later stages of the match but none of the teams managed to find the back of the net to secure maximum points. At this rate, more pressure is pilling up for Chiefs mentor Gavin Hunt who has had a rough stint since joining the club. They are on a verge of missing out in the top eight. On Tuesday Amakhosi visits relegation haunted Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at Peter Mokaba Stadium (5pm) where they will be hoping to get back to winning ways.
