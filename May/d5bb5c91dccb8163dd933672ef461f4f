MAMELODI Sundowns coach Manqoba Mngqithi was left unimpressed by the poor officiating in their match against Swallows FC on Saturday evening. The two sides played to a goalless draw at Dobsonville Stadium in Soweto. It was Sundowns' first match after clinching the current 2020-21 DStv Premiership title with a 3-1 win over SuperSport United on Wednesday. Talking after the match, Mngqithi said he believes there should have been three penalties. "The truth of the matter is I don't think the officiating was at its best today. A few bad tackles, I saw three penalties to be honest," he stated. "I saw a penalty on (Peter) Shalulile's tackle in the box, (Sibusiso) Vilakazi's tackle in the box, and I saw a penalty at the end of the match. "I was not too happy with the officiating. Legs could have been broken. (Thabo) Matlaba almost broke Vila's leg. He added: "Modiba, same thing, Mothobi, Cheeseboy (Lebohang Mokoena). I am not talking about penalties that comes to Sundowns only, I am just saying the officials are here to protect the players and make sure the match is running properly, and when they do not do that, the game becomes scrappy, and people lose their jobs.Â But today honestly speaking the officiating did not serve it's purpose. "It is very important the referees protect the players. We end up having scrappy games as a result of losing players. All these fouls you would expect some serious sanctions. That is football," he continued. Sundowns will now face trouble embattled Bloemfontein Celtic away on Wednesday before wrapping a successful league campaign with a clash against Cape Town City at home on 5 June.
