AWARD-WINNING radio DJ Bujy Bikwa has started his own podcast. Bujy, who recently left Metro FM, is collaborating with controversial podcaster MacGyver “MacG” Mukwevho on his new project called Queer Way of Life With Bujy. Speaking to Daily Sun, he said: “I didn’t want to start something without a solid team. That’s where MacG came in. “I needed someone to learn from and he has been at it for years. It was easy for me to trust him with my concept as I’ve worked with him before.” Although many people have distanced themselves from MacG following allegations of homophobia and transphobia, Bujy said this didn’t affect his decision. “I haven’t paid much attention to the hate. What I’ve noticed is that the podcast has been getting a lot of love and support, especially from the queer community. I’m not excusing his behaviour or what he said because it’s totally wrong, but we also need to be a community that teaches people,” he said. ALSO READ: MUVHANGO OPENS UP THE INDUSTRY! Bujy said his podcast was aimed at teaching people about the queer community and creating a space where things related to them could be safely discussed. “I want to create an authentic platform for the queer community to share their stories, sexuality and the way people treat us,” he said. Speaking about his departure from Metro, Bujy said it was a hard decision to make. “I had a good conversation with my bosses at Metro FM because they still needed me on the line-up, but I decided to bow out gracefully. I didn’t know where I was going. I just needed to change and grow,” he said.
