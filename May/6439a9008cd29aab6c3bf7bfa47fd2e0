ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule has been suspended from the party. The once towering political figure is now not allowed to speak on behalf of the organization on any matter, cannot address party structures or any organization pertaining to his suspension. Magashule was Wednesday slapped with a suspension letter that muzzled him as the suspension bars him from representing the party in any forum or addressing any of the party structures. The move effectively renders Magashule powerless and stops him in his tracks on any potential mobilization in the branches of regions as they gear towards branch meetings and regional conferences ahead of the national general council where he could be reinstated if he has enough support. Magashule’s deputy Jessie Duarte in a letter dated May 3, reminded him that she was suspending him in line with the national working committee resolution that members and leaders indicted to appear in a court of law must have their conduct and participation regulates during their suspension. “Accordingly, with the authority of NWC, you are hereby temporarily suspended with effect from 3 May 2021 until the final outcome of your proceedings,” Duarte informed Magashule in the letter.
