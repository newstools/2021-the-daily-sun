A VIDEO has surfaced on social media showing the beleaguered ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule boxing a punching bag. It surfaces after the ANC gave Magashule within the “set time-frame” to apologise for issuing a suspension letter to party president Cyril Ramaphosa. Just after his suspension two weeks ago, an image of Magashule surfaced on social media, showing him seated with a chessboard in front of him. Whatever these videos may mean, social media users have been interpreting them as a subtle message to Ramaphosa and the NEC. The defiant Magashule was given 30 days to step aside according to the party’s Nasrec resolution. The resolution demanded those charged with corruption and other serious crimes to step aside until their cases were finalised. Magashule and MP advocate Bongani Bongo have been affected by the rule. 48 hours for who? pic.twitter.com/Xo2s2YHv4S  After the announcement of his suspension, Magashule released a statement saying that he was appealing the decision. He then issued a letter of suspension to Ramaphosa. The ANC had a special NEC meeting last weekend, where Magashule attempted to gate-crush by joining virtually, but was allegedly kicked out of the system. In a recent interview on SAFM, Magashule said the rule had been designed to target him and Bongo. The ANC was allegedly experiencing factional fights between the radical economic transformation led by Magashule and other grouping under Ramaphosa. On Tuesday, acting secretary-general Jessie Duarte said Magashule must apologise publicly or face disciplinary measures.
