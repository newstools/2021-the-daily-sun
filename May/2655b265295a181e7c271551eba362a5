SINGER Esther Makgamatha’s journey in music has been a fruitful, blessed one. Better known as Pebetsi, she released her first album Kabelo Yaka in 2006 and recorded a music video. When she took the video to the SABC, she was told the quality wasn’t up to standard. SABC crew members offered to record a video for her at no cost! That was the beginning of her career. Pebetsi from Soshanguve in Tshwane said she was excited to have her music video done by professionals. “After the packaging was done, I received more airplay from different television and radio stations. People loved my work,” she told SunBuzz. The singer received her first award when she was only in high school. Her teachers were so impressed with her they named her best school assembly choir lead vocalist. ALSO READ: DEFIANT SIBONGILE MNGOMA WINS AWARD! “I knew then that I had talent,” she said.
