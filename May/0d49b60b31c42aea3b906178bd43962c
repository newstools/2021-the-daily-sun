TEACHING and learning at Kebalepile Secondary School in Mahikeng, North West was disrupted recently. This is because pupils protested for their school to be repaired. They barricaded the school entrance with tables as they demanded that the structure be renovated. According to the pupils, the school is dilapidated, the toilets are leaking and dirty, the ceiling is falling off and the windows are broken. They said they couldn’t focus on their studies because of the school condition. A grade 12 pupil said: “It’s now winter. How are we expected to focus when the windows are broken? It’s cold. A huge budget was allocated for maintenance, but it is not bring used. We want to know why.” The pupils said they engaged the North West Department of Education, which promised to give them a solution, but never did. North West education spokesman Elias Malindi said the department was aware of the dilapidating state of the school. “Their matter is going to be attended to. Inspectors were consolidating the already inspected work, but we’d like to urge pupils to go back to school despite the situation.” Malindi condemned the behaviour displayed by the pupils. “We believe these pupils are denying others their right to education,” he told Daily Sun.
