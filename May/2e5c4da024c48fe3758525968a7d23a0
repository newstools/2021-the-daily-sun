WORKERS at Nestle at Babelegi in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, have refused to go back to work until their demands are met. Gatvol workers downed tools two weeks ago. They said they’re sick and tired of inequality in the workplace. Workers, who asked not to be named, told Daily Sun they were demanding an increase of anything above 7%. They rejected the 3,5% offered by the company. The workers, who’re affiliated to the National Union of Food Beverages Wines Spirits and Allied Workers, said they worked tirelessly during lockdown yet the company won’t give them increases. “The pandemic never affected the company,” said the workers. “The company is offering us a 3,5% increase, which we’ve rejected. “We also want them to fix wage inequalities. “Two people can have the same position with same duties, but their salaries aren’t the same.” The union’s representative, Elliah Skhosana, said the strike started on Wednesday, 19 May when the 48-hour notice which the union served the company lapsed. “These employees are classified as essential service providers,” he said. “They’ve been working throughout lockdown and the company’s production was never compromised by the pandemic.” Skhosana said another concern was salary alignment and they were prepared to end inequality. “Workers want 7% and nothing less. Our people are prepared to go on strike until the company meets our demands,” he said. Saint-Francis Tohlang, corporate communications and public affairs director: Nestle East and Southern Africa region, told the People’s Paper: “The strike action was initiated following the non-resolution of matters arising from the wage negotiations, which commenced in September 2020. “In the current challenging economic environment and volatile trading conditions, management has tabled an offer of 3,5% which is linked to the 2020 inflation rate of 3,34%. “From an affordability perspective, the company is not able to offer a 6,5% salary increase. This, therefore, is our final offer.”
