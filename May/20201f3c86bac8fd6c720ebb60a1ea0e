SHE uses her resources to help the needy. Landezwa Luvuno also helps old women and the youth in her kasi. A teacher in KwaZakhele in Gqeberha, Landezwa recently organised a workshop for gogos at Cripple Care Hall in KwaZakhele. The aim was to empower them with information on the possibility of the Covid-19 third wave. She’s also the founder and director of Amazing Youth and Elderly Development. Landezwa told Daily Sun: “In June 2013, I saw a young person assaulting an old woman and my heart was broken. So I started this project to help gogos and young people. “I used my house and 10% of my salary to advance my dream. I sometimes organised Mrs Gogo to entertain them as well as soccer matches and indigenous games.” She said she also empowered them with Covid-19 information. “I also look after young people and help them with their schoolwork. I want to expand and take my project to the entire metro and I’d be happy if government can come on board.” Gogo Liziwe Matshoba from Zwide said: “I love what she’s doing. “If I lived in KwaZakhele, I’d attend her workshop. But I live far. May God bless her.”
