THE South African Airways’ business rescue is now over and National Treasury has allocated R2,7 billion in funds to the airline. The business rescue ended last week after it had been under business rescue since December 2019 to save it from collapsing. SAA Technical will receive R1,6 billion, R819 million goes to Mango Airlines and R218 million to Air Chefs. SAA business rescue practitioners Siviwe Dongwana and Les Matson filed a notice of substantial implementation of business rescue on Friday. The public enterprise department welcome the exit of the practitioners. “The business rescue process enabled restructuring of SAA, reducing its base cost and its financial liabilities and creating a sustainable baseline,” said the department. It said the business rescue practitioners are handing a solvent business over to the SAA Interim Board. “This doesn’t mean the work is finished. The board and management will be developing and implementing an interim business plan to sustain the operations,” said the department. The interim board is mandated to oversee the management of SAA, SAA Technical, Air Chefs and Mango. Airports Company of South Africa suspended Mango Airlines on Wednesday last week due to outstanding debt. It later lifted the suspension after the airline made a partial payment towards for landing fees, parking fees and passenger service charges.
