PRIVATE security company Fidelity Services Group is taking the fight against criminals in Joburg up a notch. The company is introducing drones to fight crime in residential estates in the greater Fourways area. The project is being implemented in partnership with the UDS Group, a certified drone operations company, and will be trialled in Fourways for two months and then extended to other suburbs, estates and shopping centres. According to Fidelity Group CEO Wahl Bartmann, the offering consists of a mobile command centre with a qualified drone pilot and a fully equipped state-of-the-art drone. “The command centre is linked to a tactical response unit for both reactive and proactive purposes. Customers contact a call centre to activate the drone response and on sites where Fidelity ADT already provides guarding, the drone response will be worked into the incident escalation procedure,” he said. “We believe drones and the deployment of a mobile drone team will not only act as a highly effective visible deterrent to criminals, but also assist to immediately track down and locate criminal elements once an outer perimeter on an estate has been breached, or in any scenario where suspects are at large on a security estate.” Bartmann said the deployment was ideally suited to security estates, and will increase proactive crime prevention as well as the ability to plan crime prevention operations. It will also facilitate a more rapid response to live criminal incidents and scenes. “Drones can also play an important role in other emergency situations that require monitoring, such as dangerous fires and land invasions,” he added.
