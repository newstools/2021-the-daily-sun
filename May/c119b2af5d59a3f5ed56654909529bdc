THE family of Ntombifuthi Mabala needs help transporting her body home for burial. The 38-year-old, originally from Mthatha, Eastern Cape, died with her boyfriend Joel Mphela (33) in a fire that burnt down her six-roomed shack in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, on Saturday, 1 May. Members of the Mabala family told Daily Sun they were planning to bury Ntombifuthi on Saturday, 15 May, but they were struggling to raise money to pay for transport and groceries. Her daughter Aviwe (18) said: “It’s hard to lose your mother, and we are still in the healing process with my little brother Avile (10).” Aviwe said they were appealing to Good Samaritans to help them give their mother a dignified burial at her home in the Eastern Cape. She said her family lost everything in the fire. “We don’t have money to carry out all the funeral costs. That’s why we are pleading for help,” she said. Pastor Wiseman Nazo of the Atteridgeville Saulsville Pastoral Association said the children needed a new place to live, as it would hurt them to go back to the place where their mum died. “We need clothes, food and uniforms for the children,” he said. Joel was buried on Saturday, 8 May in Mokopane, Limpopo. Tshepo Mmakanyane, the owner of founder of the Inspiration Hub art gallery in Tshwane, donated clothes and a food hamper to the family on Friday. “I donated to the family to give the family hope and show them love and support,” he said.
