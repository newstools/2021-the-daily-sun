WORKERS protested about working conditions and alleged mistreatment at Vilot RCL Transport in Brits on Wednesday, 5 May. According to the workers, the RCL Company, which is a subsidiary of Thari Bus Service, was contracted in 2013. But some workers who started at that time still had not been properly registered. Workers representative Bertha Baadjies alleged that the company was threatening to dismiss workers if they asked about such matters. “Some of our issues include workman’s compensation registration, deductions debited to salaries yet not credited to relevant service providers such as Sars, Momentum provident and pension fund, Sarbac levies and the Tawusa Union. “Our pension fund was last paid early last year, and the company hides our payment notices,” she said. She said that the company stopped paying them annual bonuses without notifying them. “The company changed our driver’s payment terms to monthly payments without any agreement or procedural written arrangements.” According to the workers, the company had allegedly not increased salaries for the past two years, and had bridged employment contracts several times by not paying as per agreement. The workers went home without being paid in December and they were only paid in January. The workers claimed that the company always threatened them when they requested meetings to discuss such matters. Baadjies said they paid additional financial charges when issues such as late payment happened. “We plead with the company to go under administration of Thari,” she said. RCL Human resources manager Johannes Motshwane said they were aware of the strike and speaking to the protesters to address their issues. “It’s an unlawful strike,” he said. “The main issue is the payments, and government has not paid us. “We will talk to the main contractor.”
