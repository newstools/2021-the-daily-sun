THE Confederation of African Football (Caf) have postponed the 2022 World Cup qualifiers scheduled for June until September. That will come as music to the ears of the new Bafana Bafana coach Hugo Broos. Caf in explaining their decision said conditions are not conducive due to the ongoing threat of the Covid-19 pandemic. This means Broos, who was appointed by the SA Football Association on Wednesday on a five-year deal, will have sufficient time to assess the squad in which he said it needs rebuilding. “The Caf Emergency Committee, in consultation with Fifa, decided to postpone the Caf qualifiers for the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 that were due to be played in June 2021 after taking into consideration the current challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the need to ensure the optimal playing conditions for all participating teams,” said Caf in a statement on their website. “The qualifiers will now take place in the existing windows of September, October and November 2021, and March 2022. “Caf is reassessing its protocols and processes to enhance the implementation of Covid-19 related protocols, including specifically focusing on pre-match testing which had been the source of some challenges in previous windows. Full details on the updated match schedule will be provided in due course.” This move by Caf has not come as a major surprise as these qualifiers were already under threat as many countries were struggling to meet Caf’s criteria to host these matches.
