DEFENDERS of the People staged a sit-in at Tshwane House on Friday, 7 May. They held the sit-in after there was no response from the City of Tshwane following their march on 13 April where they were demanding roads, water, electricity, toilets and RDPs. DoP had given the municipality 14 working days to respond. Their secretary Sipho Mokone said they needed a response about problems in Atteridgeville, Gomora, Soshanguve, Hammanskraal and Mabopane.

It’s taking us for a ride.” He said they went to Tshwane House for a meeting, but MMC for housing and human settlements Mpho Mehlape-Zimu was not there.  “She gave us an excuse that she had to run to another meeting,” said Mokone.  City of Tshwane acting chief of staff, Jordan Griffiths, said: “Indeed DoP came to Tshwane House and Mehlape-Zimu engaged with them.  “Matters discussed included services like shack marking, provision of housing and development of infrastructure. “Mehlape-Zimu has committed to engage with the leaders of the organisations again.”
