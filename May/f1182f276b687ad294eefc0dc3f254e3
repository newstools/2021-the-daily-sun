MEDIA personality Relebogile Mabotja, who recently gave birth to a bouncing baby boy, recalled the day she gave birth. She had announced her pregnancy in March this year, accompanied by a beautiful magazine cover. The former Metro FM personality said nothing could have prepared her for the day she gave birth. “Nothing in the world could have prepared me for this moment. Not a class, not a book, not advice, not other mothers’ experiences, nothing,” she captioned a picture of herself holding her baby in the hospital bed. Relebogile said nothing went according to plan. “So much went wrong in the build-up. It was an emergency we did not anticipate. We could have lost you again, yet the moment was perfect, and I was ready, more importantly, so were you,” she said. She further said that being a mother has changed her. “The day you were born is the day I, as your mother, was born, and I will never be the same again,” she said. Relebogile gave birth on 5 May.

Speaking to Daily Sun, she said she’s excited about her comeback because she has not had a consistent role like this on TV in a while. “I’ve had corporate gigs and worked as a producer behind the scenes, but nothing like this. This is a full-on TV comeback,” she said. “It does feel like I never left though because I’m always behind the screens, but it’s exciting. “It’s not often as a TV host that you get to be a producer and as a host use your voice. This time it’s really me who’s behind everything. Even though it’s nerve-wracking, it’s exciting.” A post shared by Relebogile Mabotja (@relebogile)
