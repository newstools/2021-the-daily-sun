SHE was hijacked on Friday, 14 May at Tonk Meyer Drive in Springs, Ekurhuleni. The two thugs put her in the boot of her car and drove to an isolated spot. When they got there they removed her from the car and told her they were going to rape her. But the 30-year-old woman didn’t allow her attackers to take advantage of her and fought them when they tried to undress her. When the suspects realised the woman was becoming too much for them, they became frightened and ran away. Cops are now looking for them. Captain Johannes Ramphora of Springs Police Station said the woman’s car keys, which she was hiding, fell during the scuffle. She took them and threw them away. “The suspects were driving a red Audi A4, while the victim was driving a silver Hyundai i10. “The Audi A4 drove past her and blocked her. She applied the brakes and two men forced her out and put her in the boot,” he said. Ramphora said the thugs drove to an open field at Phoenix Street Selection Park. “They took her out of the boot and pushed her deep into the tall grass. They told her they were going to rape her. “She fought with them and her car keys fell on the grass during the scuffle. “She took them and threw them away. They became frightened and ran away without raping her.” The suspect took the R1 000 the woman had in her purse. Ramphora said her car was taken to the pound for further investigation. Anyone with information on the suspects can call 08600 10111.
