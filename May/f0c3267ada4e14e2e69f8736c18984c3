CONOR McGregor was the world's highest paid athlete over the past 12 months, according to the annual Forbes list, earning just shy of Â£128m (R2 538 882 024,96.) The Irish mixed martial artist made R309 236 772,00 from his fight against Dustin Poirier, with the rest coming from the sale of his whiskey brand and a growing endorsement portfolio. Footballers Lionel Messi (R1 831 633 188,00) and Cristiano Ronaldo (R1 691 476 550,75) come next with NFL quarterback Dak Prescott (R1 514 824 854,38) and basketballer LeBron James (R1 360 169 960,87) rounding out the top five. Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton was the only Briton in the top 10, sitting eighth with earnings of R1 155 641 839,00 Roger Federer, who topped last year's list, came seventh (R1 269 225 029,76) with Super Bowl winning quarterback Tom Brady, basketball star Kevin Durant and PSG forward Neymar completing an all-male top 10. McGregor, 32, was defeated on his return to the Octagon in January in his sole MMA outing of the last 12 months. The Dubliner tops the Forbes list in his second appearance in the top 10, having been named fourth in 2018 after his fight with Floyd Mayweather. "Adding in his endorsements, McGregor made $158m (R2 227 096 900,00) outside of his fighting career over the last 12 months, becoming only the third athlete, after Roger Federer and Tiger Woods, to earn more than $70m (R986 688 500,00) off the field in a single year while still actively competing," said Forbes. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic wreaking havoc to the sporting calendar in the last year, the top 10 combined earned 28% more than last year's top 10. -BBC SPORT
