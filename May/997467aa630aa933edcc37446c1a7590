Afro jazz musician Gershom Ntimane has stepped out of his comfort zone and is giving gospel music a try. Raised in Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, Gershom is part of an Afro jazz band called Flavoured Melody, but he is working on his first gospel album. The 37-year-old singer, who’s been in the music industry for 15 years, has been a backing vocalist and music director. He told SunBuzz he grew up in a gospel environment and he wanted to revisit it. “I used to sing at church while growing up. But as someone who loved music, I had to stop making gospel music and try other types of music. I did and it went well. I worked with the likes of Jeff Maluleke, DJ Ganyani, Papa Ndu and Bongani Nkosi,” said Gershom. “But, at the end of the day, I found my style and rhythm as a gospel artist. “And I believe my gospel journey will be a combination of all the music I’ve done in my 15 years of being a musician.” ALSO READ | LERATO THINKS ABOUT HER MUM EVERYDAY The album he’s working on will be released before July. “I recorded a private live DVD in February. The album called The Jesus I Have Touched has beautiful songs. I’m currently focusing on finishing up the post production and I hope to release it at the beginning of June,” he said. Gershom also released a gospel single titled You Deserve It in February and he said he’s excited about the new sound. “Looking at where I come from, this is a different sound from what people know me for. I tried to bring a different Gershom. “It’s a contemporary sound that accommodates everyone and it acknowledges God. It can be found on all online platforms.”
