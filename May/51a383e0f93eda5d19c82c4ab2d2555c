SOME people use korobela to make their partners love them forever. But one couple took things to another level. A couple that used to break up once or twice a week decided to chain themselves together. They chained themselves for three months in a bid to save their relationship, and broke a world record at the same time. They have no plans of cutting the welded chain just yet. Viktoria Pustovitova (28) and Alexander Kudlay (33) began the unusual experiment to test their love on Valentine’s Day, after going through an on-off period on their relationship. According to The Mirror, the couple used to break up once or twice a week. “During another fight, Vika once again said that we had to break up. I replied: ‘Then I will attach you to myself,” the car salesman explained. The couple has confessed to feeling “fed up” with each other and has now vowed to remain chained until their wedding day, even though they’re not engaged yet. From Kharkiv in Ukraine, the couple is also using their bizarre deed to try and get themselves to millionaire status while also raising money for charity.
