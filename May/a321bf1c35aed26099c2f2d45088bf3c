ACTRESS Lerato Zah Moloi is making her TV comeback tonight, 13 May, with her debut on The Legacy. Lerato, who was last on the small screens as Madikgetla on e.tv’s Rhythm City, is joining the M-Net telenovela as Thandi Zulu. Thandi is married to Msizi Zulu, played by Siyabonga Thwala, and she’s from KZN. Tshedza Pictures announced Lerato’s debut earlier on Thursday, describing the kind of woman she was. The production company said Thandi and Msizi made quite the team. “Thandi is an enigmatic figure, comfortably moving between the realm of traditional Zulu wife and modern Joburg woman. She effortlessly combines elements of the traditional and contemporary, the rural and urban, in an organic and seamless way,” the company said.

She’s the perfect consort for a man like Msizi – an excellent judge of character, wise and patient, and able to plan ahead.” Thandi enters the story to confront Dineo, played by Kgomotso Christopher, about her affair with Msizi. Dineo and Msizi’s unexpected affair left social media shocked, but fans have grown to enjoy the storyline. Catch The Legacy on M-Net, tonight at 7pm.
