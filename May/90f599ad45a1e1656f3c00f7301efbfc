AMAZULU are keen to signing Zukile Kewuti to be their player on a permanent basis from Cape Town City. The midfielder is on loan and coach Benni McCarthy wants to make the deal permanent. Kewuti’s versatility has helped Usuthu rise to second in the DStv Premiership table, as he can also play as a left back but his preferred role is in midfield. His versatility was on display when he played as a makeshift left back when Usuthu drew 0-0 with log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns on 21 April at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium. The Inyanga-born midfielder replaced suspended regular left-back, Sibusiso Mabiliso. “You saw how well he (Kewuti) did against Sundowns in the left back position,” said chairman Sandile Zungu. McCarthy has made it clear that he wants to keep Kewuti beyond this season, as he has featured in 11 league matches so far.But he was concerned that, because Kewuti has played so well, City will be looking for a big transfer fee. The other issue is now that  City coach Jan Olde Riekerink is set to depart and likely to be replaced by Eric Tinkler, City’s management might not want to sell him. Said Zungu: “We are influenced by our coach, but when it comes to technical matters such as player selection, signing or release (players), we don’t get involved.” Meanwhile, Zungu, having seen his team breaking so many records this season, said he will reward his players at the end of the season.
