FREE State Stars’ long-serving technical team member Themba Sithole has parted ways with the club. The 56-year-old is headed to fellow GladAfrica Championship side Sekhukhune United, ending his 31-year stay with Ea Lla Koto. He has been roped in as the head of development and scouting at Sekhukhune, and will also be doubling up as head coach MacDonald Makhubedu’s second assistant alongside first assistant Sly Mosala. Sithole has spent more than three decades with Ea Lla Koto as a player and later assistant coach. He joined as a player in 1989, when the club was then known as Fairway Stars and has always remained loyal to Ea Lala Koto. Sithole has been the secret to Stars’ famous scouting and he helped recruit players such as Ayanda Gcaba, Edward Manqele, Mpho Makola, and Kennedy Mweene. He has also been the man entrusted with holding the fort on numerous occasions as caretaker coach. Sithole, however, is said to be looking for more growth in his career and believes Sekhukhune is the right place for him. His agent, Ratshibvumo Mulovhedzi of Rush Hour Sports Management, confirmed that Sithole had ended his lengthy stay with Stars and has joined Championship newbies Sekhukhune. “I feel sorry for Free State Stars for losing a dedicated coach like Themba,” said Mulovhedzi. “But he needed growth in his career as he is not getting any younger. Sekhukhune gave him a good offer and he couldn’t turn it down. He will work for them permanently until he retires. “I am happy that Themba had the blessings from Mam Joyce Mokoena (widow of late Free State Stars boss Mike Mokoena).” Sithole will be expected to play a key role in helping Sekhukhune become one of the powerhouses in Mzansi football as per their ambitions. He will bring a wealth of experience to his new side, who are pushing for promotion to the DStv Premiership.
