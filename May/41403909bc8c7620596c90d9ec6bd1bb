MAMA Jostina Sangweni’s family is pleading with the justice system to not only give their family justice, but justice for all victims of gender-based violence. Speaking to Daily Sun, mama Jostina’s son-in-law, Jabu Moagi, said women and traditional healers have been called witches without any evidence. “The suspects don’t deserve bail. An example should be made out of them. Their act was ruthless and demeaning. So far the police have displayed competency and have been working hard targeting the main suspects,” said Jabu. He said the owner of the house where mama Jostina (59) was found is nowhere to be found. “He obviously ran when he realised the consequences of his act. “I’m not sure who he was trying to impress by doing what he did, even worse leaving people he dragged into this mess to suffer alone,” said Jabu. He said although the cops haven’t said anything to them, he knew they were doing all they could to find the remaining suspects. Mama Jostina was allegedly burnt by residents following accusations that she was a witch. She was allegedly attacked for wearing traditional healers’ attire. Izangoma and the community have been supporting the family. The two suspects, Collen Sello (27) and Taelo Dipholo (28), were expected to apply for bail in the Protea Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 11 May. However, the case was postponed to 18 May as the court was closed to the public due to a water shortage.
