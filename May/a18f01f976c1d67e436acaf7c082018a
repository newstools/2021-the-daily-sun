Two witnesses testifying against murder accused Ayanda Mtika (52) placed him at the scene where his girlfriend Busisiwe Ngwadla’s body was discovered on 26 February 2019. Ngwadla (37) was stabbed 13 times at her Emerald Sky flat in Amalinda, East London. According to Sergeant Lizo Mancam, who was first at the scene, Ngwadla was found naked and there was blood all over the floor, walls and bedroom. Her neighbour, Ndimphiwe Deyi, told the court he heard loud screams coming from Ngwadla’s flat and he and another neighbour went to investigate. “The screams at first were loud, asking for help,” said Deyi. He said when they knocked, there was no answer so he banged the door with his fist. Deyi said Mtika opened halfway and his vest had blood stains. “When he opened the door there were no screams anymore. When he opened, he was calm. He said ‘it’s fine’ they will resolve the matter,” Deyi told the court. He said 10 minutes after they had left, Mtika left the complex wearing different clothes. Another witness also said she heard a “sharp scream” coming from Ngwadla’s flat. Mancam told the court when he opened Ngwadla’s flat there was blood all over the floor and Ngwadla lay naked in a pool of blood. “The body had wounds on the upper body. There was blood on the walls,” said Mancam. During his bail application in 2019, which was eventually denied, Mtika had admitted to stabbing Ngwadla multiple times but claimed he had “blacked out” in the process. He had said Ngwadla’s teenage son had told him she was seeing another man. After hearing this, he came to East London from Cape Town to confront her. Mtika was on the run for a month before he was arrested in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, on 24 March 2019. Outside court on Tuesday, 4 May there were protesters from the ANC Women’s League who sang and voiced their anger on crimes against women and children.
