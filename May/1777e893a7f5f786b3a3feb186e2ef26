AFTER teasing Mzansi, award-winning producer and DJ Bob Ezy has released his new album, The MP Deluxe. The 10-track album follows the successful release of his hit single Emazulwini, featuring Pixie L, that topped charts in many radio stations. Real name Bongani Mahlangu, Bob Ezy said: “I’ve been working on the album for two years, and I’m glad that I finally released it. I hope it will be well-received. “Its timing is perfect because after the tough year we had, we need to spread love and make soulful music to heal people.” The Mpumalanga-born DJ said working on the album was a bit tough. “Things have changed and the audience is mostly interested in amapiano. So I had to step out of my comfort zone and experiment to ensure that the songs appeal to today’s market, but without losing myself. I’m grateful that happened because growth only comes when you embrace change.” ALSO READ: JOZI FM PRESENTER COLLEN SHOT!
