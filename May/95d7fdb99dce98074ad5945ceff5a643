FREE State Stars boss, Rantsi Mokoena, has a plan that will finally ensure Ea Lla Koto gain promotion to the PSL next season. The Bethlehem-based side finished the GladAfrica Championship in fifth position at the weekend following a goalless draw against Polokwane City at Peter Mokaba Stadium. Mokoena praised his charges and coaches – Duncan Lechesa and Allan Freese – for building a strong foundation that will ensure they achieve their target. The duo took over from Themba Sithole, who is now heading Sekhukhune United’s development structures. Said Mokoena: “The first five games could have set the tone for the rest of season for us, and we’ve got only two points in those matches. But we had a change of fortune after we changed the coach and we could have won the league if we collected points early on.” Mokoena reckons having a strong defence that will concede less goals is vital if they are to reach their goal. “We have a good building block, considering that last season (2019-2020) we were seven points behind the champions (Swallows FC) and this time only six points separate us from the leaders. “We know which areas we need to beef up and we will make signings accordingly. We are one of the highest scoring (37 goals) teams in the league, but we also conceded the most goals (32), which is not good. “If we want to win the league we must shut the back door.” Having stayed in the Championship for two seasons, Mokoena is confident they will eventually return to the land of milk and honey. “Every season we play to win promotion and I feel after two years in this league, the youngsters have now gained much-needed experience,” added Mokoena.
