ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer and Benni McCarthy of AmaZulu stole the show after their DStv Premiership match at Orlando Stadium last night. The two coaches started exchanging words towards the end of the match. As soon as the final whistle was blown, the two counterparts were seen exchanging words and had to be separated by team officials. Pirates collected maximum points as they edged Usuthu 1-0 thanks to Gabadinho Mhango’s well taken free-kick in the 76th minute. Zinnbauer said after the match: “I said before the game result is very important than the performance but I must say our performance was very law. A set piece gave us the win, we are coming closer to the second and third position.” Benni blamed the referee for the loss. "We were beaten by the referee not by Pirates. Losing is part of football I’m not bitter but you losing in this manner... "This is the first time I see this referee. how can the league give such a referee a game of this magnitude... of the teams who want to finish in the second place. Today was just a joke. I didn’t want to do this because I will get fined, but today. The man in the middle spoils the game for everygame. But we know what to do we have two games remaining."
