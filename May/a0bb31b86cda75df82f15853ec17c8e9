IT’S been nothing but pain, fear and heartache since a family lost their brother who was kidnapped, mutilated and buried in a shallow grave in 2017. The family from Kokstad, KZN, said until today, there hasn’t been any progress in the matter. Esethu Jakuja, who was 28 when he died, had albinism. His family, especially his brother (35) who also has albinism, are living in fear. He to Daily Sun before his brother’s disappearance on 25 February, cars drove by the house looking for Esethu. His body was then found in Bizana on 7 March. He said growing up, his parents always worried that they may be kidnapped. “Because we were now grown up, they believed nothing would happen,” he said, adding that he was scared because cars drove slowly past their house. “Nothing has been done about my brother’s death. I believe I’m the next target.” He said he even developed a heart problem worrying about when he would die. “We’ve tried contacting the police but we get no joy. “I pray for my brother’s killers to be caught and arrested. It’s terrifying to look over my shoulder all the time.” The Nathi Youth Development Foundation started an awareness campaign after seeing the senseless killings of people with albinism. Campaign ambassador Mpilo Dladla said they were making a documentary to raise awareness about albinism. “It’s unfortunate that there are myths around albinism, which result in serious cases like people being kidnapped and murdered for body parts. “We have tried different platforms to address the case of Esethu, but everyone we try to speak to ends up being silent.” Eastern Cape police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana confirmed that a murder case had been opened and the matter was under investigation. No arrests had been made.
