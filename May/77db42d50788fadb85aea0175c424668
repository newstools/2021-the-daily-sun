MEDIA mogul Basetsana Kumalo has celebrated the work of young author Zulaikha Patel. Social justice activist Zulaikha came into the spotlight when she fought the Pretoria High School for Girls policy that forced them to straighten their African hair. She was only 13 at the time, and has since written the children’s book My Coily Crown Hair. In celebration of this milestone, Basetsana took to her Instagram page and wrote: “On Africa Day, I celebrate this young lady @zulaikhapatel_ who challenged the status quo and fought for her cultural identity. In 2016 at the age of 13, she and her classmates held a demonstration against Pretoria High School for Girls regarding black hair. She was told that her Afro is too big and distracting in class. Teachers had told the students that their Afro hair is “exotic” and needed to be tamed, implying that girls’ hair needed to be straightened or tied back, not worn as Afros.” ALSO READ : ACTOR MUZI WEARS MANY HATS IN ARTS The former Miss SA continued: “She recently launched her book My Coily Crowny Hair, that seeks to empower and encourage young girls to embrace themselves fully, and most importantly to celebrate their identity and not be ashamed of who they are. It’s only when the younger generation take ownership of their voices that Africa will continue to rise. Shine African child, shine.” Zulaikha responded: “Aw aunty B, thank you so much for these words of encouragement. It’ll always be an honour to take the baton and continue from the foundation you have laid.” Other media personalities also congratulated the young writer, including Nomzamo Mbatha, Connie Chiume and Pele Mkhari. Connie asked: “Where can we buy the book?” Pele said: “So important and powerful. Shine African child.” Instagram user Siyabonga said: “Leader she is. Congratulations, uzele iqhawekazi my queen.” The book is about taking pride in natural and Afro hair. A post shared by Basetsana Kumalo (@basetsanakumalo)
