FOR the past three months, gogo Zitholile Langa has been living at a community hall with her nine grandchildren. The 71-year-old from Esibhudeni Village in Nkandla, northern KZN, moved to the hall after her mud house fell and almost killed her grandchildren. Fear forced her to seek shelter at the local community hall because she didn’t have the money to rebuild her house. During her stay, she had no hope that one day she’d ever have a place to call home. All she did was pray every day. Her prayers were finally answered on Saturday, 22 May when Nkandla Mayor Thami Ntuli, along with former IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi, handed her the house keys. Langa opened her new four-roomed furnished house for her and her grandchildren, aged between three and 23. The gogo couldn’t hold back the tears. “I don’t know what to say. I had lost hope that one day my children will have a place to call home. I’ve seen the house, but it hasn’t yet sunk in that it belongs to me.” Langa’s situation changed when her daughter, who had mothered the grandkids, died last June. “The situation got worse when my daughter died and left me with all the children. No one is working. We rely on my pension and their social grants,” she said. Ntuli said they couldn’t turn a blind eye to gogo’s situation, and Buthelezi taught them that their main duty was to improve the lives of the people they served. “We had to build a home for gogo because she has no other place to go to,” he said. Buthelezi said it was not the municipality’s duty to build houses, but that of the provincial government. But he was pleased to see that he had moulded leaders such as Ntuli, who improved people’s lives.
