AZINGA “Golden Boy” Fuzile made a successful comeback with a stunning TKO victory over Martin Ward in an IBF junior lightweight title eliminator in Las Vegas, United States on Sunday morning. Englishman Ward came with an impressive five straight wins since his loss to James Tennyson in 2018, while Fuzile dropped a TKO  decision to Shavkat Rakhimov in his last outing in September 2019. Fuzile bounced back from his first career loss with this impressive seventh round TKO to guarantee himself a title shot. Fuzile is now the mandatory challenger for the vacant IBF title. Fuzile (15-1, 9 KOs) and Ward (24-2-2, 11 KOs) were engaged in a close fight until the end came suddenly. Fuzile floored Ward twice. In the final round, Ward seemed to twist his left knee when he collided with Fuzile, which looked to have made it difficult for him to move properly. Moments later, Fuzile landed a big right hand punch that put Ward down. England’s Ward got up from both knockdowns, but the battered, bleeding Brit’s trainer instructed referee Mike Ortega to stop the fight following the second knockdown. The 24-year-old from Duncan Village in the Eastern Cape looked sharp during his first fight since Rakhimov stopped him in the eighth round of their IBF eliminator in September 2019.
