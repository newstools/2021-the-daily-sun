Although Covid-19 is still very much present, it’s enlightening to learn that the anxiety has since been eased. During hard lockdown, when the virus was still claiming many people’s lives, some of us lost focus of preventing chronic diseases. It’s time we go back to our true senses and remember that TB, cancer, heart failure, diabetes, high blood pressure and HIV/Aids continue to claim many people’s lives. People who’re diagnosed with these chronic diseases should follow doctors’ prescriptions to put the diseases under control. Those who’ve not yet been diagnosed with any of the chronic diseases need to test for them. We need to be a few steps ahead of these illnesses. Prevention is better than cure.
