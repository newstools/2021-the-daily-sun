SAPS provincial weekend operations have managed to bust 1070
suspects! The suspects were arrested for various crimes including
drunk driving that amounted to 150. According to SAPS spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo the
suspects were found to have committed serious violent crimes such as rape,
sexual assault, murder, attempted murder and assault with intent to cause
grievous bodily harm. "Other crimes included robbery, theft, fraud,
possession of drugs, possession of suspected stolen property and possession of
an unlicensed firearm," said Masondo. Masondo explained that people seemed to have forgotten about
the dangers of Covid-19 therefore they had to arrest 70 suspects in an attempt
to enforce level one lockdown regulations. "People forgot about wearing their masks and
tavern owners forgot that there's a
curfew that restricts their trading hours. The suspects had to be arrested for
contravention of the National Disaster Management Act," he said. Masondo added that the Provincial Commissioner of the police
in Gauteng Lieutenant General Elias Mawela joined by MEC for Community
Safety Faith Mazibuko led Okae Molao
operations in Kagiso, West Rand on Saturday. He said, the operation yielded positive results with more
than 60 suspects arrested. "The arrested suspects will appear in various
Magistrate Courts within Gauteng in due course," said Masondo.
