BOSASA consultant Kevin Wakeford dismissed allegations that the company fleeced money from Home Affairs. He told the Zondo Commission yesterday that the department instead saved millions of rands in a turn-around project that Bosasa was involved in. Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula was minister at the time. Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi alleged that Home Affairs lost money in the project. He further stated that Bosasa got tenders because while Wakeford was advising Mapisa-Nqakula, he was on a monthly retainer at Bosasa. “The department made savings as attested in its annual report. It was very evident that it was saving money,” said Wakeford. He said he was not involved in tenders and said people should look at the positive results when he was the advisor. “With due respect, he’s (Agrizzi) been proven to be a liar,” he said.

Wakeford also denied allegations by Agrizzi that he was paid R100 000 a month for helping Bosasa’s boss Gavin Watson “resolve Sars issues”. “I was employed as a consultant to Bosasa from 2006 to 2015 on a monthly retainer of R57 000. This amount never changed.” He said the only time he was paid R100 000 was when he had not been paid the previous month. Wakeford said Agrizzi lied about him because he was jealous and angry that he was directly hired by Watson, and that they had a close relationship. He claimed that the former COO saw anyone who had a direct relationship with Watson as a threat. He said another reason they did not see eye to eye was because of his views on economic inclusion and black empowerment. ALSO READ: WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO NINE BABIES!

He said if required he would prove the authenticity of the recording. “He saw black empowerment as a burden rather than a necessity,” said Wakeford.
