RELATIONSHIPS with neighbours usually go from one extreme to another. You either take leftover birthday cake for them to enjoy, or you argue through the walls at 2am. But one person has said they intend to “burn down” their own flat after one of their neighbours casually left a terrifying warning note for them to find. The message read: “Dear neighbour, I live at 11a and have recently found a snake outside my front door. This is not the first snake I have found. There have been two in my flat and two outside my flat in the past three years. “I assumed the snakes were coming from the pet shop on the corner, but they have told me they have not lost any snakes. “I would ask this person or anyone who has had a similar experience to contact me asap to discuss this matter. I am in after 6pm most evenings.” According to Daily Mail, after the post was shared online others did very little to reassure them about the situation, as one produced some made-up statistics to increase the fear, writing: “I wouldn’t worry. Most snakes can flatten their vertebrae and shuffle under most doors with ease.”
