A COUPLE recently chartered a plane for their extravagant wedding in the air in India. The couple was trying to avoid Covid-19 restrictions, but the flight was packed with 170 people and only 100 was allowed at a wedding. Action was ordered for the guests and couple to face the law. The extravagant wedding came under a lot of criticism as social media users blasted the guests for not wearing masks, or following social distancing as much of the country struggled with the health crisis. In a separate matter, a groom died a day before his wedding day in the same country. After testing negative twice in 10 days, the 32-year-old man died in hospital a day before his marriage. Tests conducted after his death confirmed that he had Covid-19.  He was cremated as per Covid-19 guidelines in his village, barely hundreds of metres from a venue that was to host his wedding. Mzansi has also had its fair share of controversial top shayela weddings when the Guptas landed a plane full of guests at the Waterkloof Air Force Base without approval. The private jet landed in 2013 with more than 200 passengers on board. It was estimated that festivities for the wedding cost almost R430 million. This as helicopters were hired to ferry guests and reports that suggested flowers were being imported from Switzerland. Politicians, dignitaries and Bollywood stars also attended the extravagant wedding at Sun City.
