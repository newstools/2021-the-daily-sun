SENZO Meyiwa’s family wants a share of the Senzo Meyiwa album profits. The upcoming album is set to be released by the end of May. A spokesman for the Meyiwa family, Sfiso, said they were not aware of the upcoming album. “I’ve just learned of this album and their gesture is welcomed. “I’ve also learned that the artists involved will visit the family. We also appreciate this because it will give us a chance to discuss our share in the album,” said Sfiso. “I say this because the album will be generating some income from sales. For that reason we’re also expecting a financial share from this album.” The manager for Sthembile “Glama” Nyoka, Dr Maz Zulu said: “It is only fair that his family gets a share from this project. I can guarantee the Meyiwas that once we meet we shall reach a reasonable agreement.” The Senzo Meyiwa album is a collaboration of three maskandi artists including Glama, Mbuzeni Mkhize and Potso Ngobese.

Glama told Daily Sun they have not contacted the Meyiwa family. “Our plan is to visit the Meyiwa family before the album is out,” she said. “Our visit will be solely to show gratitude to his family for giving us Senzo, so we titled it Senzo Meyiwa. In my view this will ensure his legacy lives on.” Glama revealed she had a crush on Senzo. Mbuzeni said: “It has always been my dream to work with Glama but I never thought we’d collaborate on something as huge as this. Senzo was a huge brand, and to be associated with his name means a lot to me.” Potso said: “I have no doubt this is going to be a killer album. I’m glad to be part of this and I’m looking forward to meeting the family of this legend.” Senzo was shot and killed in 2014.
