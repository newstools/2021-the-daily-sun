Bishop Israel Makamu will appear on AmaBishop where he’ll be explaining his side of the story. This comes after a recording of a call between him and one of his congregants. In that call, Makamu was allegedly asking for a poke and when the girl refused, he repeatedly said “wabhora ngwanaka”. Daily Sun spoke to Makamu and he’s still adamant he was just asking for the office keys. He’ll be taking the hot seat on AmaBishop which airs on Moja Love (DStv channel 157) every Sunday at 9pm. The promo’s been shared a lot on social media and Mzansi can’t wait to hear what he has to say. In that promo video, one of the bishops questions Makamu about why the girl calls him “daddy” and Makamu says he’s taking full responsibility for his actions.

Founder of Movement Against Abuse in Churches, Solomon Ashoms said Makamu will just be pretending to offer an apology to his victim because all he cares about is saving his reputation. “A proper apology should be to the victim, her family, all done privately before coming on TV to seek for sympathy from people,” said Solomon. “Stop with the fake repentance only because you got caught. You must take responsibility for trying to kiss her in your church office also,” he said. Gladys Habaka said Makamu must face the music. Mike Khumalo said Makamu has been dragged enough and he’s clearly sorry for what he did. “I understand the girl’s family was hurt but what else does he need to say? This is tiring,” said Mike.
