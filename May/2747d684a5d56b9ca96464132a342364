LADIES of the night at Mutare’s oldest brothels were recently left green with envy after their co-worker received R220 000 from an alleged client. The magosha could not believe her eyes after the man decided to splash her with the bank notes for one night of service. According to her colleagues, the man was scruffy, dressed in a dirty and ragged pair of black jeans, a black T-shirt and worn-out shoes. He was reportedly unlikable and seemingly drunk, leading the other ladies to reject him when he came knocking for business. According to Indafrica.com, the magosha’s colleagues and security personnel at the brothel confirmed the incident. “We were queuing up for clients as usual outside our lodging that night. Business was slow and not promising. A guy approached us and asked me to spend the night with him. He was looking scruffy and I couldn’t agree to his request, so did a couple of my colleagues. He then approached my friend,” said the colleague. “We heard him telling her that he had US$15 000 (about R220 000), but he only said 15. So we thought he meant US$15. They went upstairs and the following morning, she told us of the ‘golden handshake’. She screamed and we were all startled. We gathered in the corridor to hear the news. We were all shocked. She flaunted the money on her bed and asked us to take pictures,” she added. “She immediately left the room around 9am, fearing that she would be robbed. She told me that she intended to buy a car before travelling to Bulawayo.”
