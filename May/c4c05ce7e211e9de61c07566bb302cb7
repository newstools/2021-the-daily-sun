Irvette van Zyl is the IAU new world and African women's ultramarathon world record holder. She shaved off three minutes off Alyson Dixon's 50km marathon of 3:07:20, set in 2019, to record a stunning new 3 hours 04 minutes 23 seconds. The Nedbank 50km Nedbank Runified: Breaking Barriers marathon took place in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape on Sunday where top runners were chasing a world record. For her efforts, Van Zyl pocketed a cool R150 000 for shuttering the two year standing world record to set a new one, as well as R100 000 for winning Sunday's race - a healthy R250 000 in her pocket. Second home was Lilian Jepkorir Chemweno in a clean 3:05:00 and Dominika Stelmach was third in 3:10:26. In the men's race, Ethiopian, Ketema Negasa breasted the tape in an amazing 2:42:07, shaving off a few seconds from Thompson Magawana's men's world best over 50km, which was standing at 2hr 43min 38secâ€š recorded in 1988. Also pocketing R250 000 for his achievements, Negasa was followed home by South African Jonas Makhele who crossed the line in 2:42:14 and his compatriot Ntshindiso Mphakathi came third 42 seconds later - both still within the new record.
