WHEN he was caught breaking into his neighbour’s house on Sunday, 23 May, he confessed that drugs had taken over his life. The nyaope boy from Rockville kasi in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said smoking made him do bad things and terrorise the community. Angry residents said the 25-year-old was begging for mercy from an angry crowd that had gathered. He told them his friends pressured him to break into houses and he regretted his actions. He said the drugs made him constantly want to steal. Homeowner Lilian Sepato told Daily Sun that she was shocked when she found the young man in her backroom with items he had allegedly stolen scattered behind him where he had dropped them. “I called his gogo, who is not fully aware that her grandson is a thief. This is not the first time he tried to steal something from me. I’m still shocked and I wonder if he will continue with his bad ways,” she said. Lilian said she was living in fear as she didn’t know what would happen if he was released from jail. Neighbour James Mathabathe said the addict had been terrorising residents for too long and would be safer in jail than on the streets. “What is shocking about this man and his friends is that they commit crime even during the day. They even claim they can get into houses without dogs barking at them,” he said. “Criminals don’t belong in this community. They’re disrespectful and should be careful because they will not always walk free. We are tired.” Police Constable Herman Moremi said a case of malicious damage to property was opened after the suspect gained entry through a window.
