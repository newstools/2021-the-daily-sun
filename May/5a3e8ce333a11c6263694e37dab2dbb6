TRADITIONAL health practitioners in Limpopo can now perform their duties without fear of contracting Covid-19. Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba launched a vaccination programme for traditional healers at Helen Franz Hospital in Senwabarwana on Tuesday, 11 May. She said it was crucial to vaccinate them so they can help fight the pandemic without fear. “These are people we believe can help us fight this pandemic in their own way,” said Ramathuba. “We believe traditional health practitioners have a role to play.” She said wearing masks and practising social distancing was the best way to prevent the spread.  “We need to take this pandemic seriously because we’ve witnessed many people’s lives being lost.” Ramathuba said they had to bring community workers on board because they’d be going around assisting the elderly with registrations. The MEC said a third wave of infections was expected and the public shouldn’t drop its guard. She was concerned about ongoing weddings and parties that were crowded. “It’s shocking that many of our people have forgotten about the virus,” she said. Limpopo Traditional Health Practitioners leader Morifi Makgabo said government efforts were appreciated. “People should not be afraid to be vaccinated because failure to do so will see us losing many lives,” he said. He urged the public not to undermine traditional healers as they played a huge role in communities. Traditional healer Jelly Mathladisa said: “We have to lead by example because failure to do so will see us being defeated by the pandemic.”
