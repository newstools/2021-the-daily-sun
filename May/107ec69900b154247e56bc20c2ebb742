ANGRY residents of Bokamoso squatter camp outside Rustenburg in the North West marched to the Rustenburg Municipality to demand service delivery. They claimed they had been living in Bokamoso since 2019 and the municipality had promised them electricity and houses, but this still hasn’t happened. Many times they have tried to engage the municipality to talk about a way forward but they were shut down. The residents said municipal officials are living comfortably in their homes while they suffered. March leader, Bonga Dlawo, said they have had enough. He said they wouldn’t spend another cold winter without electricity or houses. “We have been living in the new stands in Bokamoso since 2019. Rustenburg Local Municipality said they will deal with our service delivery issues. We are here today to ask them where is our electricity and the waste they promised to collect. “We need electricity because people are dying like animals due to the crime rate. People are getting sick from the waste that collects there. We are here in peace requesting serious intervention. The municipality must come assess the situation and offer solutions. Next time we won’t be this peaceful,” said Bonga. Rustenburg MMC for Human Settlements John Molubi said they have placed Bokamoso residents as a priority. “We have placed this community on a housing programme. The construction is still in progress. Our issue now is that the number of houses is not enough for the many families there, which needs to be dealt with. “We have also engaged Eskom about electricity provision for not only Bokamoso but for nearby areas as well. They are busy building a substation there. Our issue is the backlog due to not having electricity licensing, so it has become difficult to provide electricity to the community.” Molubi said they will be visiting Bokamoso next Monday to asses the situation further.
