BRIGHTON Mhlongo has been forced into early retirement after partially losing eyesight. His left eye is not not functional, according Tshakhuma FC coach Dylan Kerr, after being hit hard with a ball at training last month. The reigning Nedbank Cup champions took the player to different optometrists, Ophthalmologist and Retina specialists, SunSport has learnt, and all concurred that the 30-year-old from Soweto will not be able to use the eye anymore, forcing the former Orlando Pirates star to retire following the freak incident. SunSport understands that he was hit with a powerful shot from Farai Madhanaga in training, which damaged his left eye, forcing him to hang up his gloves, as goalkeepers must have a sharp eye. Kerr was very emotional explaining Mhlongo's plight following their 1-0 cup win against Chippa United.
