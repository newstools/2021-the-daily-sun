ORLANDO Pirates could not move to third spot after they played out a goalless drawagainst Stellenbosch in the DStv Premiership clash in Stellenbosch on Tuesday. In fact, Pirates were fortunate to walk away with a draw from the Winelands where they could have spent the afternoon better with the grape sundowners than huff and puff against lowly Stellies on the pitch.  When Ashley du Preez messed up a glorious opportunity to score before the break, Stellies coach Steve Barker deep down knew their chances of victory were gone.  With an empty net in front of him, the nippy striker sent a well-weighed cross wide off the mark.  It wasn’t the only first time the home side had let the visitors off the hook, in the first half in which they dominated.  It was the beginning of what may yet be a testing period for Stellies as they are not far from the relegation danger.  When the lively Bucs midfielder Nkanyiso Zungu provided an opportunity for Gabadinho Mhango towards the end, however, his team-mate could only direct a rather wild shot over the crossbar from 18 yards.  A goal then and the Pirates would have had maximum points they probably didn’t deserve.  It is pretty much how their season has been with Zinnbauer’s men dropping they should be dropping.  Yes, they could still finish in the top three, on 55 points, should they win their remaining games.  But the likes of Deon Hotto will have to come to the party upfront.
