GOSPEL artists held a peaceful protest outside the SABC demanding to be given airplay and a chance to showcase their talents on television shows on Friday, 14 May. Speaking to Daily Sun, Godfrey Mahlangu said they come in peace with the hope of getting a clear message across. “All we want is to be heard! We make good music and have talent. We just don’t have the platform to display it. I believe it’s because we don’t have money and aren’t recognised yet. But how’s that going to happen if we are not given a chance,” said Godfrey.

Why must it always be the same people’s music that’s played. It’s not fair.” Justice Sunduza told the SunTeam they hope their memorandum will be received by someone who will make a difference.  “We just need gospel to be taken seriously like the other genres are. Gospel is only played on Thursdays and Sundays for a short time. They play our music on Sunday morning. Who’s there to listen because people attend church at that time?” he said.  Godfrey said: “Unfortunately we were told they can’t accept our memorandum because their office was not informed about our submission. So now we have to follow all necessary procedures and go back again.”
