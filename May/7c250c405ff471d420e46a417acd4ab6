PITSO Mosimane enters arguably his toughest week as coach of Al Ahly. First, it's the Cairo Derby against Zamalek Egyptian Premier League derby tonight and later in the week, the Caf Champions League quarterfinal powder-keg against former side Mamelodi Sundowns. Mosimane has to win the 122nd derby against the log leaders, Zamalek, to narrow the gap to a point. The Red Devils have so far been unable to close the four-point gap, though they still have two games in hand. They have collected 40 points from 18 matches, four adrift of Zamalek. But pressure has been mounting on Mosimane, though he enjoys the support of the board... except for one member. According to Mohamed Fadl, a former Ahly player, Mosimane may not see out his two-year term. Pitso Mosimane is a lucky coach and is good during big games only,” Mohamed Fadl told KingFut. “People remember Al Ahly’s performance during the René Weiler era and the achievements of Manuel José only. Mosimane doesn’t yet know the potential of coaching Al Ahly. It is not right to play Walter Bwalya at the expense of Mohamed Sherif.
