What a way to watch a soccer match final. Flanked by your heroes is something that many fans couldn't have ever imagined. But Daily Sun and Nedbank made it possible for four lucky winners who entered a competition last week and were surprised by guests of honour in their respective homes. Matthew Booth, Mark Williams, Jerry Sikhosana and Doctor Khumalo watched Tshakhuna FC defeat Chippa United 1-0 in the Nedbank Cup final on Saturday with the fans. Amos Masombuka from Pretoria, Innocent Molebatsi from Protea Glen Ext 27, Silvester Makhonjwa from Montana and Delco Mtshelu from Mogale City had the best day of their lives.  Makhonjwa expressed his excited at the People's Paper and encouraged others to respond to competitions in Daily Sun. Makhonjwa, like others, responded to a question in the Daily Sun and were randomly selected to play hosts to the soccer legends, including braai and live crossing on SuperSport TV. "We kitted out their homes and now these lucky competition winners each get to watch the #NedbankCup2021 final with one of our four legends," said the sponsor.
