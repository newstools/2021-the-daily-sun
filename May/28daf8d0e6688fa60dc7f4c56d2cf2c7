THE
corruption case against former president Jacob Zuma was on Monday postponed to
26 May. Zuma is
facing charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering from the country’s
procurement of arms deal. He’s alleged to have taken bribes in return for
providing political protection to one of the winning bidders, Thales. Outside the
court, things took an interesting turn when Tony Yengeni and suspended
secretary-general Ace Magashule took to the podium. Addressing
supporters, Magashule started by making it clear that nobody would ban him
under a democracy. He added
that nobody would remove the ANC from him, he would not form any party and that
he would die within the party. “I will
never leave the ANC, comrades. I will never be banned from it. When we come
back on 26 May, we will bring the whole of Free State,” said Magashule. He said the
whole province, not just ANC members, would descend to the Pietermaritzburg
High Court, adding that he also wanted KwaZulu-Natal to come. On
Facebook, Lucas Masinayibethele Sbhene said: “He is there to gain or borrow
Zuma’s fans, nothing else. He’s using Zuma to gain support. Many politicians
tried that, but they failed. Zuma’s fans are loyal to him alone; not even the
ANC or anyone else, akazame naye.” Home Less
Wanderer said: “Magashule is there to support himself, not Zuma. Aren’t the
so-called supporters supposed to be at work? Is it a holiday today?” Matlhatsi
Wa Ka-Matlhatsi said: “Magashule is smart. Please don’t take him for granted!
He knows what he is doing. That step-aside resolution will never work. Trust
me. The court will nullify it.”
