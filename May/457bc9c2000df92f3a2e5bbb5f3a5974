SA Rugby director of rugby Rassie Erasmus has confirmed the Springboks will be vaccinated ahead of the international season, starting with home Tests against Georgia and later the British and Irish Lions. Erasmus told a virtual media briefing on Friday that the Boks squad members and management and the support staff will receive the jab for the Covid-19.  “The Springbok squad and wider group that will be involved have either been vaccinated already, or are in the process of doing so,” said Erasmus  “The Lions have been vaccinated and together and we’ll be going to a hard bubble. We will certainly try to vaccinate everyone before we go into the bubble.”  Erasmus added a 45-man squad, which will include the Springbok and SA ‘A’ squad, will be announced on 5 June.  Boks coach Jacques Nienaber said he is expecting to have the overseas-based players to be available for the warm-ups matches against Georgia on 2 and 9 July.  “Some of the guys are already here,” said Nienaber. “Some of the Japan-based players have already been with us this week. There are one or two injured guys from abroad who are here. As the teams fall out of their different league in the Premiership, Pro14 and Top 14, they will be joining us.  “There are clubs, and it’s 90% of the clubs, that have such a good working relationship with us. 90% of the clubs were open. It does differ from club to club. In the future, when a player wants to go abroad and we can’t afford him, but we want him to stay in the mix, if it’s a club that is helpful, has a great high-performance programme and is willing to work with us, like, Munster, Sale or Toulouse, we would encourage you if we can’t keep you.  “There are other clubs that make it difficult sometimes. We will tell a player that if you want to stay in Springbok contention, have a second think about that one.”
