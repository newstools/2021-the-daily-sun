Mzansi comedians will celebrate Africa Month by cracking jokes in their own languages. Siya Seya, Thabiso Mhlongo, Lindy Johnson, TT Pasha, Bra Van My and King Flat will headline a one-night-only event, the African Comedy Night. The show, which aims to celebrate African languages, will be held at the Ramolao Makhene Theatre at The Market Square on Saturday evening, 22 May. English and Afrikaans comedian Lindy Johnson told SunBuzz: “It will be a wonderful storytelling evening, especially because the stand-up comedy acts will be in different languages. It will show a wonderful mix of languages. “Also, we know people haven’t been out much in the past year, so this is exactly what they need.” Xhosa comedian Siya said the show will help unite South Africans. “African Comedy Night is going to be a beautiful thing that unites various ethnic groups. I like that we’ll all get to showcase our languages. In comedy, we’re always diverse and this being part of such a show is exciting,” said Siya. ALSO READ |COBRA TO QUIT ACTING!
