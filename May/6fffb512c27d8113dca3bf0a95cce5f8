GOLDEN Arrows coach Mandla Ncikazi says he will be happy to see the DStv Premiership title come to Durban. However, his side lost ground in the title race when they were beaten 1-0 by Durban rivals and fellow title challengers, AmaZulu, at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday. The game’s only goal was scored by Luvuyo Memela, who netted in the referee’s optional time before the end of the first half. With no big name players, Arrows are fighting for league honours along with Mamelodi Sundowns and Usuthu. “As a citizen of this province (KwaZulu-Natal), it’s good that AmaZulu are where they are and it’s good that Arrows are where they are,” said Ncikazi. “This province has not seen the league championship title since Manning Rangers won it (in the 1996-97 season). “Maritzburg United are also doing well so far. “It’s good that these teams (in KZN) are this competitive.” Despite the loss to AmaZulu, Ncikazi said his team’s objectives still remain the same, to finish in the club’s highest position in the PSL, which was fifth place. Talking about their match against Usuthu, Ncikazi said: “I’m disappointed and surprisingly we didn’t put pressure in front of the goals. “In the critical phase of the match we conceded. While we are disappointed, we are still on course on what we planned at the beginning of the season. “We want to finish in the highest position the club has finished.” Arrows’ highest finish in the PSL was fifth, which they achieved twice in the 2002-03 season (51points) and 2008-09 (46 points), when Ncikazi was still Abafana Be’sthende’s assistant coach to now the Brazilians’ co-coach, Manqoba Mngqithi.
