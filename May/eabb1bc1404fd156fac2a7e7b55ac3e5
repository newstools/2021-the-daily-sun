ALL Melita Ntlailane (41) wanted to do was to stop a quarrel, but she ended up being burnt with boiling water. Melita said her brother Martin Moloele’s girlfriend was using the water in the house instead of the tap outside. When their mother criticised her, an argument broke out. The quarrel on Tuesday, 11 May in her parent’s home in Leeuwfontein, near Baviaanspoort, was so intense she was woken up while sleeping in her boyfriend’s house next door. “I went to intervene and my brother started beating me with his fists,” she said, adding that he allegedly pinned her to the floor while the girlfriend was boiling water. “The fight took almost an hour. I was unconscious as he pressed me down on the floor.” She said her son (20) tried to separate them, but the girlfriend allegedly poured the boiling water over her head. Melita screamed for help. “I was helpless on the ground but the girlfriend showed no mercy,” said Melita. The brother and his girlfriend apparently left her with burn wounds on her head, face, breast, back and neck. The mother of three said her brother was unhappy when she moved back into the house in 2017. “His girlfriend doesn’t clean the house and cooks only for herself,” she said. Melita’s other brother, Molefe Ntlailane, claimed the girlfriend had said she didn’t come to clean but to bring punani for his brother. “I want to see the girlfriend gone and to leave my family in peace,” he said. Thabiso Leballo of Vhathu Phanda Community Forum Gender-based Violence Brigade said: “We want GBV cases to be taken seriously and the suspects to rot in jail.” Martin said he didn’t beat up his sister and his girlfriend didn’t burn her. “Please don’t talk to me. Talk to my lawyer,” he said. Captain Mavela Masondo said: “A case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was opened. A suspect was arrested and appeared in court on Thursday.”
