DRIP Footwear founder Lekau Sehoana is a man on a mission. Lekau, who is about to open the 10th and 11th Drip stores in KZN, is aiming for 21 outlets around the country by September. The proudly South African brand opened stores at Pavilion Shopping Centre in Westville and Galleria Mall in Durban on Friday and Saturday, respectively. Lekau said the past months had been inspiring. “I’ve been having sleepless nights, but above everything, it’s been inspiring. I’ve been growing. I’m blessed and this is a dream come true,” he said. Lekau told Daily Sun that he did not expect the success of Drip to happen this quick. The entrepreneur, who has publicly shared how grew up without shoes, said looking back at his life, he couldn’t believe his journey.

I look back at where I come from and I see that this is just God showing off. I feel like He is working through me,” said Lekau. He added that they were currently working on a possible collaboration with rapper Cassper Nyovest. “Cassper is a friend of the brand. I’ve even heard people saying he has shares in the company, but he doesn’t. The pandemic taught us a lot about supporting each other and being conscious of our surroundings,” said Lekau. “At Drip, we understand that musicians aren’t working as much as they used to, which is why we hit up some celebrities to work with, including Cassper. We’re currently discussing how we can grow the brand together, but nothing has come out of it yet. Maybe we’ll announce something soon,” he added. Drip will be opening its 12th store at Vaal Mall in Vanderbijlpark and the 13th at Hemingways Mall in East London in the coming weeks.
