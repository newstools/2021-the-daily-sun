THERE is an ongoing hearing in England where a cop is accused of stirring his colleague’s tea with his 4-5. The male cop is on the verge of being dismissed for misconduct after he allegedly stirred a female police officer’s cup of tea with his 4-5. The cop is also alleged to have walked in on her changing in the locker room, a misconduct hearing was told. According to Daily Mail, the incidents are said to have happened between May and July 2020 at Sussex police station and were raised to a supervising officer. In a hearing held at Sussex Police Headquarters, the victim said she had previously experienced similar gestures by the same cop. “I would have liked to use the mug as a gateway to tell him to back off but I wasn’t given that chance. “I feel it could have been resolved,” the article read. Statements from colleagues of the two claim they had seen inappropriate behaviour conducted by the cop. One witness was asked to clarify about the locker incident and the response was: “The door wasn’t knocked. it was forcibly opened.” Daily Mail claims the accused has denied most charges but admits he pushed the door to the locker room. The cop is accused of breaching the standards of professional behaviour which amount to gross misconduct. The hearing continues.
