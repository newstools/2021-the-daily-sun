ART has influenced and changed the lives of many young people. And on Saturday, young human rights activists from across Africa will come together at the Aartfluence Human Rights Festival to share how art has inspired their lives in activism as well as socially. This online festival, which started on Wednesday, is presented by Centre For Creative Arts at the University of KZN which has partnered with the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation. The director of the centre, Ismail Mahomed, said Mzansi youths have put the country on the global map. He said this is why the centre saw the need to be at a forefront of listening to their voices of hope and courage. “In a country such as ours, where human rights struggles by youth leaders such as Nkosi Johnson and Hector Pietersen have catalysed transformation and turned the attention of global community to South Africa, we should remain at the forefront of listening to the new voices of hope, courage and resilience of youth activists,” said Mahomed.
