ANGRY residents gathered in large number in the Thohoyandou Magistrates Court on Monday, 24 May. They were chanting and singing that they will take the law into their own hands if traditional leader Chief Mudzulathungo Nelson Mmbi (66) was given bail. Community leader Sipho Masia said they were praying that the kidnapping suspects were not given bail because residents also suspected that they were linked with ritual murder cases in the village. “Young Steven Phalanndwa has been missing since 28 March. While we were trying to find him, well-known traditional leader Chief Mmbi and his co-accused were in a kidnapping incident in another villager. We suspect that the chief might know something about the missing person and some cases of ritual murders in our areas,” said Nelson. He said they had 13 cases in the village, where some people were still missing and some found with body parts missing. The bail application was postponed to Tuesday, 25 May. Two weeks ago, unknown people set alight the chief’s eight-roomed house. It was also reported that a bakery and library were also set alight in the village. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said cops launched a manhunt after the house was set alight by unknown suspects. He said in the past weeks, residents were barricading roads leading to the Tshikonelo Village with trees and stones, chanting and singing in opposition to the bail application of the accused and co-accused. He said the case of kidnapping came about after Lucas Mbedzi (34) from Tshikonelo went drinking on 19 April. He was later surprised to find himself in the middle of the bush in Nyabane Village at about 8pm. Police suspect that he might have been drugged and taken there.
