SINGER and songwriter Presss has released his fifth studio album titled XO. The Afro-soul singer made his mark when he won talent competition Coca-Cola Popstars. Presss, whose real name is Preston Sihlangu, was part of the group called 101 alongside Pam Andrews, Erin Samson, Ntumiseng Mokhasipe and Kurt Herman. But it was only when he launched his solo career that he made his true artistic mark. His album Black, which was released in 2014, got him noticed and he was nominated in the Metro FM Awards for Best R&B Album. Speaking to SunBuzz, Presss said his fans are in for a vocal treat. “I haven’t been this nervous about releasing new music since I released my debut album. “I hope this album, which feels like I have been working on for a lifetime, is well received as I have put my heart and soul into it,” he said.
