Kaizer Chiefs defender Daniel Cradoso, Swallows FC defender Keagan Ritchie and former Bidvest Wits player Brandon Barkhuizen are on a mission to unearth the next big talent. The trio, who are partners in a football programme that they run, are searching for young players who have the potential to be the next big thing. The Dream Big Kid football stars organization is aimed at “training young stars aged 2yrs – 8yrs, step by step through the fundamentals of football and the importance of both physical and mental activity, both personal and team development.” Cardoso, Ritchie and Barkhuizen are hands-on in the training of these youngsters and offer their wealth of experience as well as firsthand guidance and mentorship for all the young players. In Mzansi, many have argued that the development of players often begins a bit late which leads to players not grasping the basics of football sufficiently until they are much older. The trio is determined to ensure that young players are taught the basics at a much younger age so they do not have to be started from scratch and older age later in their youth careers.
