AMABUTHO, reed dance maidens and women’s regiment Isiphithiphithi paid their last respects to regent Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu on Thursday, 6 May. They converged at the KwaKhangelamankengane royal palace in Nongoma, singing tribute Zulu hymns for the Queen’s private burial. They will camp at the royal palace until the Queen is buried by only close family members and amabutho. Queen Mantfombi’s body was transported from Johannesburg to KZN on Wednesday to spend a day in her palace before her final send-off. Eswatini delegations, wearing their traditional regalia, also came in numbers to pay their final respects. Prince Nsika Zulu told Daily Sun that amabutho would be part of the private burial. “I won’t reveal more details about the funeral because it is a secret and private. I won’t reveal what role amabutho will play, but they know their important work,” he said. Reed dance festival maiden Nosipho Zuma (29) told Daily Sun that they would always remember Queen Mantfombi’s lessons during the annual event. “She taught us to love ourselves and respect other people, especially the elderly. She also encouraged us to get education and become independent while we respect our culture. I encourage all maidens to continue attending the reed dance and keep ourselves pure until we get married.” Another maiden Sindi Cebekhulu (32) told Daily Sun that they must not think everything was over following the deaths of the King and Queen. “Both of them were responsible for reviving the annual reed dance after it had been banned many years earlier. They also protected it when it received a lot of critics. Maidens must not get discouraged and lose their virginity, thinking that it is over. The next king will continue with all our cultural activities,” she said. Family members, friends, relatives and Shembe congregants attended the private funeral service for Queen Mantfombi inside the royal palace.
