MINUTES after a cash-in-transit vehicle was blown up between Meadowlands and Fleurhof, spectatorsÂ wanted to get their hands on the money that might have been left behind.  But scrap metal scavengers stood on the sides of the road and planned how they were going to get what was left of the car used to ram the cash-in-transit van. "These people (police) should go, we want to strip that car and take metal to the scrap yard." One of them said he will go for the rims, while the other said he will target the copper that's in the wiring of the car. After the van was rammed with the old Mercedes-Benz, a hail of bullets followed as the robbers opened fire on the van. Three massive explosions followed, leaving the van torn in half. At the moment it is still unclear if there were any fatalities as law enforcement agencies were crisscrossing the crime scene looking for clues. One police officer who was on the scene was heard telling another person over the phone that firearms used there were high calibre rifles. "There are AK47 and R5 cartridges," he said. Motorists using the short route from Roodepoort to Meadowlands had to use longer alternative routes after the road was cordoned off.
