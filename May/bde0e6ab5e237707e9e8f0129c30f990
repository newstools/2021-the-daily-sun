Chelsea set up an all-English Champions League final with
Manchester City after beating Real Madrid 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in the
semi-final second leg, going through 3-1 on aggregate on Wednesday. Timo Werner put Chelsea ahead (28), nodding into the
empty net from under the crossbar after Kai Havertz's chip had hit the
woodwork, before Real rode their luck as the hosts missed four big chances to
double their lead in the opening 20 minutes of the second period. The hosts finally got their second to kill off the tie
with five minutes remaining as Mason Mount stuck home substitute Christian
Pulisic's centre at close range, capping off a fine display and marking an
extraordinary turnaround at the club since Thomas Tuchel joined in January.  Chelsea will now play in their third Champions League
final (2008 and 2012) in Istanbul on Saturday May 29, and have set up just the
third all-English Champions League final after 2008 (Man Utd-Chelsea) and 2019
(Liverpool-Tottenham) as Manchester City look to complete a treble.  This year's final between Chelsea and Manchester City will take place in
Istanbul on 29 May.
