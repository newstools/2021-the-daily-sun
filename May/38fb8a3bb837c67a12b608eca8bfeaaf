WE can all admit that sleeping is one of the most peaceful activities, especially if you have the best bed and blankets. While we get frustrated at the noisy neighbours who disturb our sleep with their thumping loud music, one other loud sound that can put pause to one’s sleeping patterns is the sound of someone snoring. Yes, that human tractor sound that comes out as soon as the lights go off. By definition, snoring happens when you can’t move air freely through your nose and throat during sleep. This makes the surrounding tissues vibrate, which produces the familiar snoring sound. People who snore often have too much throat and nasal tissue or floppy tissue that is more prone to vibrate. The position of your tongue can also get in the way of smooth breathing. According to Medical Guide magazine, snoring is caused by age, being overweight, nasal or sinus problems, alcohol, smoking and medications. According to sleeping experts, these are some of the remedies that can minimise and even get rid of snoring: 1. Change your sleeping position Elevating your head four inches may ease breathing and encourage your tongue and jaw to move forward. There are specifically designed pillows available to help prevent snoring by making sure your neck muscles are not crimped. 2. Sleep on your side instead of your back Try attaching a tennis ball to the back of a pyjama top or T-shirt (you can sew a sock to the back of your top then put a tennis ball inside). If you roll over onto your back, the discomfort of the tennis ball will cause you to turn back onto your side. 3. Lose weight Losing even a little bit of weight can reduce fatty tissue in the back of the throat and decrease, or even stop snoring.
