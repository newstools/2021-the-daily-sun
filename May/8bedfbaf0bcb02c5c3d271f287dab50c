IZINYOKA, load shedding, cable theft, and load reduction are some of the frustrating factors for South Africans who often find themselves in the dark with no electricity. But Joburgâ€™s City power said there are more factors that threaten the supply of electricity to their customers and one of them is mother-nature, in a form of trees. High raising trees that grow meters from the power line, often fall on them and disrupt the power supply to residents, and sometimes to key facilities such as hospital. However, to counter this City Power is working hand in hand with City Parks to deal with the trees that grow next to the power lines to prevent future unexpected power outages. On Friday, the power entity took the media on a tour, showing some of the challenges they face.
