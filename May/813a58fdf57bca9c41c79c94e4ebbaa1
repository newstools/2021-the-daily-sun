Banyana Banyana star Thembi Kgatlana is more often than not the difference-maker on the pitch with her sterling performances. But the speedy forward, who plays for Spanish Primera División club SD Eibar, also prides herself on making a difference off the pitch. Kgatlana gives back to the community in many different ways through her foundation, the Thembi Kgatlana Foundation. Earlier this month, she started her campaign “Buy a girl a pack of sanitary towels.” Kgatlana’s foundation donates sanitary towels to schools and women’s teams across the country. The 24-year-old has no intentions of stopping there.She recently changed a young aspiring footballer’s life by donating her old soccer boots. “Nike doesn't only empower me and change my life on the field. My used boots make a difference in someone else's life to pursue their football dreams,” said Kgatlana.
