IT was on this day 17 years ago that South Africa capped one of its greatest moments since the dawn of democracy. On this day in Zurich, Mzansi won the rights to host the 2010 Fifa World Cup. A delegation led by the late president Nelson Mandela had flown to Switzerland for the big announcement. And of course, the announcement by Fifa president Sepp Blatter was met with excitement from the South African bid delegation, which included Irvin Khoza, Danny Jordaan, Molefi Oliphant, Patrice Motsepe and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and sparked wild celebrations across the country. South Africa held off a strong challenge from Morocco, beating the North Africans 14-10 in the final vote to become the first African country to host the event. The decision rightly made up for the disappointment suffered by Mzansi after they lost the vote to stage the 2006 tournament by a single vote to Germany. The moment preceded the famous speech by Madiba: “Sport has the power to inspire and unite people. In Africa soccer enjoys great popularity and has a particular place in the hearts of people. This is why it is so important that the Fifa World Cup will, for the first time, be hosted on the African continent in 2010. “We feel privileged and humbled that South Africa has been given the singular honour of being the African host country. We must strive for excellence in our hosting of the World Cup while at the same time ensuring that the event leaves a lasting benefit to all our people.” As it would come to pass, the 2010 World Cup was declared a success by Fifa.
