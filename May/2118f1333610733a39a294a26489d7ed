FORMER Bafana Bafana coaches – Molefi Ntseki and Stuart Baxter – are set to be announced by Kaizer Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung today, as replacement for axed Gavin Hunt. Baxter has been appointed as head coach while Ntseki will be the club’s technical director, and head Chiefs’ development structures, according to SunSport sources. Though the club’s football manager, Bobby Motaung, could not deny or confirm anything, the writing is on the wall. “The chairman will make the announcement when the time is right,” Motaung said yesterday. Speculation has been rife that Chiefs have been after Baxter’s return to Naturena, and SunSport further understands that the Scot is expected in Mzansi tomorrow to take over his new role. Baxter quit his job with Indian side, Odisha FC, earlier this year while is readily available after he was sacked by Safa as Bafana coach. “Reading between the lines, Baxter will be joining Chiefs on a short-term deal while polishing the head coaching seat for Ntseki. “Chiefs are particular on development and Ntseki is also passionate about unearthing raw talent from his SA Under-17 days. Safa’s loss is basically Chiefs’ gain.” Chiefs parted ways with Hunt following the club’s poor of run of form in the PSL, and their 2-1 loss to Black Leopards, after Lidoda Duvha came from behind to clinch the match. This broke the camels back and Amakhosi couldn’t take it anymore. This is despite Chiefs having qualified for the Caf Champions League semi-final where they’ll face Wydad Athletic over two legs. Chiefs are next in the DStv Premiership action on Wednesday against Golden Arrows at FNB Stadium.
