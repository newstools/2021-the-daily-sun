HIS father applied for an RDP house 10 years ago but never got it. Gift Sikhosana also applied many times, but there’s still no house. He’s now losing hope of ever living in a proper house. The 33-year-old from Tweefontein, C near Kwaggafontein in Mpumalanga, said it’s very difficult to live in a shack with a nine-month-old. “Life’s not good for me. I have been longing to get an RDP for a long time. “I was born and raised in this shack, and had my first child in it. My father died in this shack. “He wished to own a proper home before he died. “The shack is now dilapidated and no longer fit for human occupation.” Gift said he’s unemployed and can’t afford to build a proper house. He told Daily Sun he survives by doing odd jobs and on the child social grant. He said he partitioned the inside of the shack with a mud wall. “I’m scared the wall might collapse on us one day,” he said. “It gets wet when it rains. It’s now winter and we have to endure it.” Gift’s aunt, Maria Sibiya (48), said they’ve tried everything to help him get a house. “I’ve now lost hope. Whenever houses are being built in the area, I think he’ll also get one, but nothing,” she said. Thembisile Hani spokeswoman Simphiwe Makoka said Gift should visit the municipal offices, and bring along his ID, so they can check on the system. She said if he’s not found on the list, officials will help him register so that he stands a chance to get a house.
