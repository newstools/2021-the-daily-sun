ELEGANT gifts are handed over at weddings as a token of celebration to the newlyweds. In Mzansi, gifts such as blankets, electronics, and furniture are often gifted to newlyweds. But a couple in Australia decided to do things differently. They asked their guests to pay for their honeymoon instead of buying them gifts.

The guest said she was confused with the request made by the couple. The couple sparked debate as people shared their opinions on how they’d deal with the situation. “I know it’s acceptable to ask for money or gifts, but I’m personally not comfortable with it. I’d suggest giving one payment and if you don’t want to turn up to the shower empty-handed, maybe take a bottle of champagne,” one suggested. “Just make a small payment for each occasion through the app. It’s modern times and this is a pretty standard custom these days,” one woman wrote.
