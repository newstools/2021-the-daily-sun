BUSINESSWOMAN and actress Sophie Lichaba has joined the long list of celebrities who are victims of scammers. Over the weekend, she warned the public about a fake account opened under her name. The person behind the fake account invited people to join Bamboo money, promising them big financial returns in a short space of time. Taking to her Facebook page, Sophie wrote: “Fake account alert! Attached Facebook account is fake, including the scam of taking money from people. Please share! People are stranded and sick-minded, using people like me. Be cautious. Do not invest.” ALSO READ | WATCH: RAPPER AKA BARES IT ALL Her fans took turns to confirm that they had suspected the account was fake. “Dankie!
