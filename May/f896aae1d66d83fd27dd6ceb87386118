ONLY a few months ago, Fana Mabuza (39) thought his dream of practising as a lawyer would never come true. But SunPower came through for Fana and he’s now an LLB graduate! Dr Sikhumbuzo Mabunda saw an article in Daily Sun in December last year about Fana’s struggle to pay fees, and the Good Samaritan settled the fees on his behalf. Fana from Palm Ridge, Gauteng studied law after being motivated by late human rights lawyer, Advocate George Bizos. He met Bizos while working as a security guard at the Legal Resource Centre in Joburg. A friendship developed between the two, and Bizos encouraged Fana to register for a law degree. Fana was an excellent student and things were going well, but then Bizos, who had helped with Fana’s fees, died last year. Fana had been retrenched as a security guard and he struggled to pay his fees.  “After Daily Sun published my story, Dr Mabunda contacted me and offered to pay my fees,” he said. “After that I studied really hard. I felt indebted to Bizos and Dr Mabunda, who had just helped me. “I felt the best way to repay them would be to get the degree. “So many wonderful people believed in me and gave me their prayers and money. I feel blessed and fortunate,” he said. “I’m applying every day to get articles. I will not rest until I’m an admitted attorney.”
