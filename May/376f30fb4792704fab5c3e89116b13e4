KIDS were entering the school yard on the morning of Monday, 17 May when, to their shock, they saw a half-naked man masturbating inside a car. They called their teachers but the man continued masturbating. Teachers called the police and he was bust for public indecency. Captain Johannes Ramphora said the suspect parked his car outside the gates of two neighbouring schools in Springs, Ekurhuleni, this morning. “Pupils informed their teachers who went to see for themselves.” When interviewed by police the suspect alleged he had problems with his wife at home. Angry parents said what the man did was wrong. “Why must he do his indecent acts in front of primary school kids?” said one parent. Said another parent: “We don’t want perverts near our children. How are our children going to concentrate after seeing all that? His problems with his wife don’t involve us.” The man will be taken for mental observation. Steve Mabona, spokesman for the Gauteng Department of Education said: "Indeed, it is disappointing that people can do such activities in and around our school. We are happy that the police took decisive action on this matter." The suspect will appear in court this week.
