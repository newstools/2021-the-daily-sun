MAMELODI Sundowns will clash with Orlando Pirates in an all-important DStv Diski Challenge Rewired blockbuster at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday (noon) to decide which club will qualify for the semi-finals. So far, three teams – Kaizer Chiefs, AmaZulu and Cape Town City FC – have booked their spot in the last four. The winner between Downs and Bucs will join the three teams that have already qualified. Pirates and Sundowns are in Group Two. They are second and third respectively with 12 and 10 points. If the game ends in a draw, Pirates will qualify for the semi-finals. Sundowns coach Surprise Moriri said it is not negotiable and they have to win this match as they are targeting to play nine (seven group matches, semi-final and the final) games in the competition. “We know we have to win this game against Pirates,” Moriri stated. “We know it will not be an easy game. We need to keep a clean sheet and if we do that, we know our chances of scoring are very high. Pirates won’t make things easy for us. “We have to play well in terms of taking care of the ball. We have to sure that we create and score those opportunities (we create) it will be very interesting. The boys know we have to play nine games, which means we must win this match and play in the semi-finals and reach the final.” Players such as Thando Buthelezi, Cassius Spandiel, Musawenkosi Mdhluli and Siyanda Nyanga will be carrying Sundowns’ hopes. For Bucs, Boitumelo Radiopane, Sifiso Luthuli and Azola Tshobeni are expected to play a critical role in this encounter.
