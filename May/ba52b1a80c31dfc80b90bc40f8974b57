 MAMELODI Sundowns will have a mountain to climb if they are to reach the Caf Champions League semifinals.  But it may not an impossible peak to scale after they lost 2-0 to Al Ahly in the first leg of their quarterfinal tie at Al Salam Stadium in Cairo on Saturday.     In the second half, Sundowns picked up the tempo and they had another chance in the 58th minute when Mosa Lebusa sneaked in to head at the near post off a cross on the right but his effort was saved by a hawk-eyed Mohamed Elshenawy.   Sundowns held their own away from home, although they couldnâ€™t get the crucial away goal.
