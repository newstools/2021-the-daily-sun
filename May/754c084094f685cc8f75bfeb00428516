COPS have bust a man who allegedly snatched his ex’s toddler on Monday, 3 April. Southern Cape police spokesman, Captain Malcolm Pojie, said cops bust the 30-year-old man on Wednesday, 5 May and recovered the 16-month-old baby boy. “The child had minor bruises all over his body and was taken to hospital,” Pojie told Daily Sun. “Heidelberg police acted on information early yesterday morning and pounced on the suspect as he hid in a shack in Dollo Squire, Heidelberg. The baby boy was found in a concealed compartment. The suspect was arrested on the spot and the baby was taken to hospital for medical treatment. The little boy was snatched on Monday at about 9.30am. According to the police, the mum had an argument with the ex, who took her baby and fled. Pojie told Daily Sun the ex is not the father of the baby. “The suspect allegedly threatened the mother of the child, after which he took the child and fled into the bushes,” said Pojie. “His mother alerted the police, who immediately mobilised members to search for the child.” Eden cluster commander, Major-General Oswald Reddy, praised the team that recovered the child. The suspect has been charged with kidnapping and is expected to appear in court on Friday.
