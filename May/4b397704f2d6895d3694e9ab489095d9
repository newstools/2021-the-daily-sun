VLADISLAV Heric is hopeful Chippa United will translate their dominance into goals and move out of the relegation zone.  Chippa were held to a 0-0 DStv Premiership draw by fellow relegation candidates Black Leopards at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Wednesday, failing to leapfrog TTM into 14th spot.  They have 25 points and 27 matches and will need to win their remaining matches and hope TTM slip up to be guaranteed of safety.  “We dominated 90 minutes, we just missed so many chances. We were a better team today and showed hunger to score and win the game. Unfortunately, we are not scoring and we have to think about reinforcing the strike-force. But once we score it will be a different story. “I’m very happy with the performance but at the end of the day it is about how many goals you score. Hopefully in the next games we will score more goals. Scoring is the most important.  “We have six days to prepare for the game against Bloemfontein Celtic and I believe we will be much better in the next game.”  Leopards are still stuck at the bottom of the DStv Premiership, having only moved to 19 points. It doesn’t look good for Lidoda Duvha.
