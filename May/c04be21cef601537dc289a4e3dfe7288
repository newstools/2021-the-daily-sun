THE magistrate presiding over the case of alleged gang boss Nafiz Modack in Cape Town has survived a shooting. He was allegedly caught up in the crossfire in Mfuleni on Sunday that left a 50-year-old cop dead. The magistrate allegedly was shot and three people including a three-year-old boy injured. Modack and his co-accused were supposed to appear in court, where he faces 63 charges including money laundering, murder and attempted murder. The matter had to be postponed to next week and will be given to another magistrate. NPA spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said the case had been postponed and would be heard next week. “The matter has been postponed until next Monday. The presiding officer of the court had an accident and was not in court this morning. The matter was moved to another regional court, where it was postponed.” The 50-year-old lieutenant-colonel attached to Delft Police Station allegedly took her car to a car wash in Taurmaline Street, in Bardale squatter camp in Mfuleni. While waiting for her vehicle, three unknown men approached the men washing the cars and asked how much it cost. While they were still talking, one suspect fired gunshots at the cop before fleeing the scene in a white Toyota Avanza. The magistrate was one of three people close to the incident and was shot and rushed to hospital. Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “Cases of murder and attempted murder were opened for investigation after a shooting incident occurred yesterday afternoon, 16 May at about 2.45pm at a car wash in Bardale squatter camp, Mfuleni. A 50-year-old victim, an off-duty lieutenant-colonel, was shot and fatally wounded and three others including her three-year-old grandson were injured. “All injured victims were taken to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. The suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested.”
