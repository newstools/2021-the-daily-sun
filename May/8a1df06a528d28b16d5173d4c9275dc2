NEVER take a shortcut! This is the advice from Nokuthula Dumakude-Magubane (49), who went to jail for fraud amounting to millions of rands. “I was sentenced to 40-year imprisonment in 2014 for fraud and spent seven years in jail,” said Nokuthula from Muden Village in Greytown, KZN. “I was released due to the coronavirus and good behaviour.” While in jail, Nokuthula wrote four books: The Purpose, From Pit to Palace, The Voice of the High and Who is the Leader, to be released on 30 May. “I wrote my first book in my first year in prison,” she said. “This was to remind people that we work and chase success but forget to worship and praise God. “I was disobedient before I was arrested. I was busy chasing success and saving people’s lives as a nurse. “I was a Christian but didn’t care for the 10 commandments.” She was moved to different prisons in Gauteng, Eastern Cape and KZN and studied theology for three years. “I did courses in anger management, self-esteem and business skills.” Nokuthula attended a course on theft and fraud, where she learned that fraud is a lot like murder. “Whether you steal from a person or company, it’s an attack on the nation. “You’re stealing from people who depend on you and they’ll suffer.” Nokuthula is now a brand new person. “I’m an evangelist, public speaker, life coach and businesswoman. “I train the youth in the hospitality business,” she said. She lost her marriage and business.
