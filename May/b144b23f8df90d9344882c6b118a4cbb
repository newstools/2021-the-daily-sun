“Big Xhosa is not a celebrity!” This declaration was made by hip-hop star Cassper Nyovest. He was responding to a Twitter user, Katlego Velile, who proposed a celebrity boxing match between Emtee and Big Xhosa. “Big Xhosa vs Emtee,” Velile suggested. “Hahaha. This would be interesting even though Big Xhosa is not a celeb. Put some respect on Emtee’s name,” responded Cassper. But Big Xhosa’s fans tagged him. Asanda Tokwe wrote: “@SOS_RSA kuthethwa ngawe apha fondin.” Soon there was a blow by blow exchange of words, with Big Xhosa spewing insults at Cassper. He said he would beat Cassper Nyovest. To which Cassper responded: “Mfanaka, nkao roba roba I won’t even lie to you. Don’t do this. I know you want clout Mara tswada. It’s not gonna end well.” ALSO READ | WEDDING SHOW HOST TURNS SHEBEEN QUEEN In a follow-up tweet, Big Xhosa said: “I was minding my business and you’re the one who said shit about me and I responded, now I’m the one that wants clout? You’re using my name to promote whatever shit you promoting. You’re the clout chaser here, but you’re just manipulating people to think otherwise. You smart.” In his original post, Cassper invited his fans to suggest names of celebrities who can take part in a boxing match. “Celebrity boxing is sooo big in the states. I think we could make decent money in Africa with it too. It could also boost boxing on the continent. Who do you think would make a great boxing fight?” he wrote. From there, floods of messages were pouring in with celebrity names. More names were thrown in the hat including his name vs AKA, but he declined. Sihle said: “You and Forbes would’ve been a great start.” In his response, he said: “I don’t think anybody wants to see that right now. Someone else maybe, question is who would be a worthy opponent? Status and commercially.” Rapper Big Zulu said he’d like to have a boxing fight. “Nam ngiyafisa ukungena elingini qhawe lakithi,” he wrote.
