AFTER divisions and squabbles appeared over the past few days, the Zulu royal family now seems to be trying to unite ahead of Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu’s burial. On Tuesday, late king Zwelithini’s siblings Prince Mbonisi and Princess Thembi were summoned to a special meeting by Queen Mavis, the only surviving wife of Bhekuzulu, who was the father of Zwelithini. The senior queen, also known as Gwabini in the royal house, held the meeting with them together with Zulu nation prime minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to resolve their squabbles. It was held at KwaKhangelamankengane Royal Palace on Tuesday night. Mbonisi confirmed they had a meeting with the queen but refused to give further details. Insiders told Daily Sun there was a big concern about the squabbles and division, and Mavis was the last hope as all royal houses respected her. “Even the late king respected her and often asked for advice. There’s hope that both sides will listen to her,” said the source. Mangosuthu also reported to her and asked for advice about matters of the royal house. Another insider told Daily Sun more trouble was coming ahead of the announcement of Prince Misuzulu as king on Friday during the memorial service of the Queen. “On the other hand, the special court interdict to stop the announcement of the regent, or king, filed by Zwelithini’s wife Queen Sibongile and her daughters will be heard on Friday,” said the source. “It’s not clear whether it will be in the open court or chambers, but it seems the royal house will be served with court papers to not make the announcement.”
