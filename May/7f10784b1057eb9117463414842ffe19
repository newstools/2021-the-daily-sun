THERE was deadly drama at a shopping centre in the Polokwane CBD in Limpopo on Thursday, 6 May. This comes after a 34-year-old man from Seshego caught his 32-year-old wife with another man inside a car in a parking lot. He allegedly pulled out a gun after an argument started between him and his wife, who is a bank employee. He then allegedly fired several shots, killing her instantly. The other man, believed to been having an affair with the woman, managed to escape and run for his life when the argument ensued. The husband, who is a taxi driver, escaped unhurt and was arrested while trying to jump off from the first floor of the building. Police spokesman, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said when the police received a call about the incident around 2pm, they rushed to the scene. Upon arrival, they found the bullet-riddled body of the woman inside a vehicle. Mojapelo confirmed the man, who is reported to have been with the woman, allegedly fled from the scene and his identity is being withheld as he is still subject for investigation.  “We have recovered the firearm believed to have been used in the murder. The firearm will be subjected to ballistic examination to determine if it was used in the commission of other serious crimes,” he said. “The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage but domestic violence cannot be ruled out,” Mojapelo said. The suspect will appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court soon, facing a charge of murder. A witness, Matome Molewa (38) said onlookers were very angry. They apparently pleaded with the man to jump off the building so they could deal with him. “He was saved by the police. Otherwise he would have been killed by the furious people who had fully packed Grobler Street,” said Matome.
