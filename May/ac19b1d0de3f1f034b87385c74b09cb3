IT’S amazing to see how an instrument that comprises of 88 different notes has evolved into a South African sound that is rapidly taking the world by storm. The amapiano style of house music emerged around 2012. It’s a hybrid of deep house, jazz and lounge music characterised by synths, airy pads as well as wide and percussive baselines. While its popularity blew up in the Gauteng, the eight other provinces have rapidly caught up with this wave. In 2020, the genre experienced increased popularity across the African continent with noted increases in digital streams and chart successes in countries far from its South African origin. Within the same year, Zimbabwean songstress and amapiano hit maker Sha Sha, became the jewel of Southern Africa after she walked away with the Viewer’s Choice Best New International Act at the prestigious BET Awards. The singer signed to amapiano producer DJ Maphorisa’s Blaqboy record label in 2018 and has featured on several hits with Maphorisa, DJ Kabza De Small and Samthing Soweto. She’s released her own hit EP. Amapiano albums such as Scorpion King and The Rise of the Baby Boy enjoyed multi-platinum selling success. Artists like Focalistic are rapidly becoming the future of the genre with the creative infusion of hip hop and amapiano.
