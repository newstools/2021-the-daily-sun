SHE regrets betraying her best friend and her punani is paying the price. This after she poked her best friend’s boyfriend in early February. The 31-year-old from Vlaklaagte in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun she met the boyfriend at a house party. “We immediately bonded and had a lot to drink,” she said. “We found a room and poked. We slept there all night, and when we came out everyone knew what had happened. “But before I could deal with getting caught my friend called and confronted me.” The woman apologised but her friend didn’t want to hear it. But she didn’t take this to heart. A week later her boyfriend dumped her. “He said he needed to figure things out,” she said. Two weeks later the woman moved on with a new boyfriend. They were happy until they poked. “He also told her he didn’t want to be with her anymore,” she said. ALSO READ:
