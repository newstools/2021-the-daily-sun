If the ANC-led government wins the lion’s share of the local government elections this year, it would be a miracle. Election postponement would definitely be its life-saver. It’s universally agreed that almost all states on the African continent have gone back their promises and commitment to good governance and accountability post-colonial liberation. After releasing crime stats last week, Police Minister Bheki Cele admitted he saw stolen motor vehicles from Mzansi in Mozambique, but was helpless because of an unco-operative neighbouring government. On the N1, N4, N14 near Tshwane, motorists are robbed after their tyres are spiked. Steel spikes are placed on the roads by crime syndicates. Copper cables are stolen and sold at colluding scrapyards or shipped out of our shores. As a result, the running of trains and the supply of electricity is disrupted. Illegal drugs are endlessly smuggled in and out of Mzansi. Police are also under siege. Letter by  Thami Zwane Edenvale
