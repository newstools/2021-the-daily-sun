KAIZER Chiefs striker Samir "Kokota Piano" Nurkovic is determined to continue where he left off last weekend when Amakhosi face Tanzanian giants Simba SC in the Caf Champions League quarterfinal fixture on Saturday. The 28-year-old Nurkovic inspired Amakhosi to a victory in the first leg where he scored a brace and assisted when Amakhosi thumped Simba 4-0 last weekend at FNB Stadium. On Saturday, Chiefs' be away to Simba in the return leg at Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium in Dar es Salaam (3pm SA time). "Amazing feeling from the game still, excited and looking forward to the second-leg, and we are preparing and doing everything to go into the semi's" Nurkovic told Chiefs' media department. His two goals saw him making it into the Caf team of the week with two other Amakhosi players Eric Mathoho and Leonardo Castro. The beaming confident player said it is an amazing feeling as he is trying his best after not having a good season in the Premiership. He stated: "Yeah, amazing feeling. And I mean, the Amakhosi family already know. â€œThey don't just call me, Kokota Piano for nothing, so I'm there, and I'm trying my best always to make them happy." Nurkovic urged his teammates to be focused amid reports that they will get a hostile reception in Tanzania. He says they must focus on reaching the semi-finals of the continental showpiece, which will be Amakhosi's first-ever in the club's history.  He added: "We cannot think about those things. All we have to do is stay focused and be 100% focused on our game, how we are going to play, and how we will perform on Saturday.  "I mean, there's not so much time to do a lot of things, we just have to stay focused and with the same fighting spirit from the last game, continue with the same performance, everything and everything will be fine."  The winner on aggregate between Simba and Chiefs will face either Algerian side MC Alger or Moroccan giants Wydad Casablanca who were in the same group with Chiefs in the semi-final.
