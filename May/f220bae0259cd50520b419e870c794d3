MISS Universe hopeful Natasha Joubert, who represented South Africa at the pageant over the weekend and had hopes of taking over the reigns from Zozibini Tunzi, has thanked Mzansi for rallying behind her. In a heartfelt post, Natasha said going into the Miss Universe pageant she knew she had big shoes to fill and even though she did not get a placing, she hopes she did South Africa proud. “I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for your love and support not only since last night, but also during the lead up to the finale of Miss Universe. I’m proud of the work we’ve done, the way we competed and for always staying true to myself. Even though it did not go as we had planned, I promise this is not the end but only the beginning,” she said.

Congratulations to @andreamezamx for being crowned Miss Universe. Our hearts may be broken but our spirits will never be.” CEO of the Miss South Africa Organisation Stephanie Weil said: “We are incredibly proud of Natasha and how she represented both us as an organisation and the country on a world stage. We believe she did South Africa proud and her performance was remarkable from start to finish. We look forward to welcoming her home where her Miss Universe South Africa journey will continue.” On Sunday, 16 May, South Africa’s very own Zozibini handed over the crown over to Mexico’s Andrea Meza, who is now the new Miss Universe. Zozi was crowned in 2019 and has had the longest reign in the history of Miss Universe due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A post shared by Natasha Joubert (@natasha_joubert)
