AMAZULU will be out to maintain their unbeaten run in the DStv Diski Challenge Rewired this weekend. The Usuthu youngsters seem to have drawn inspiration from their DStv Premiership first team, which have been exceptional this season. In the Diski Rewired, AmaZulu have punched above their weight reaching the tournament’s semi-finals without defeat in seven matches. They will on Saturday face Kaizer Chiefs in the second semi-final match scheduled for noon at Tembisa’s Makhulong Stadium. In the other semi-final, Cape Town City FC will host Mamelodi Sundowns at the same stadium at 9.30am to kick off proceedings. It’s expected to be an interesting day of great football, where Amakhosi are also on an impressive run of six straight wins in the Diski Rewired. AmaZulu coach Sboniso Vilakazi remains unshaken by facing Chiefs, who have reached the semi-finals by winning Stream Two, which had big guns such as Orlando Pirates and Sundowns. Vilakazi said they are expecting a tactical encounter from Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard’s charges. “The boys are well prepared for this match. We cannot deny fact that Chiefs have been one of the big teams since the tournament started. They started on a bad note, losing first game but they managed to win all of their six remainder matches,” said Vilakazi. “But we remain unfazed. We are here (in the semi-finals) on merit. We are not here to add numbers. We will compete and hope to make it to the finals. “When the Diski started, we told ourselves that we want to play nine games. This will be our eighth and then the final.” Meanwhile, the Citizens reserves have a squad consisting of youngest player such as 15-year-old Kaka Sifumba. However, they have to pass through Surprise Moriri’s unpredictable lads, who are brimming with confidence after dumping Pirates out of the competition with Musawenkosi Mdhluli’s last minute goal last weekend.
