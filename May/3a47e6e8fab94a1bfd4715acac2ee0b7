FOR the past 10 years Mabilu Mokwalakwala has been celebrating his birthdays in a special way by giving back to pupils in need. The Good Samaritan from Flora Park in Polokwane, Limpopo, decided to celebrate his 53rd birthday this year by not going to schools but to churches as well. He celebrated his birthday on Friday, 14 May, with pupils from all four secondary and seven primary schools in Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof. He showered them with presents at the event held at Kiletsa Primary School. Mabilu donated sanitary towels to last them more three months as well as face masks, hand sanitisers, food and clothes. He said he decided to celebrate his special day with needy pupils as he likes helping them and putting smiles on their faces. “For the past 10 years, I have been celebrating my birthday by throwing a huge celebration and giving needy pupils gifts as I aim to instil their self-confidence. “This year I decided to make some changes by visiting them where they are. Even though it’s my birthday celebrations, I don’t expect gifts. I’m the one who’s giving out gifts because it’s my passion to assist the needy.” He said he doesn’t like seeing pupils suffer while he has the means to help. California Mailula (14), a grade 8 pupil at Motsheudi Secondary School, couldn’t hold back her happiness. She thanked Mabilu for the donations. Representing principals, Leah Sekgota said: “We pray to God to multiply more people like Mabilu in our village because he is a blessing to us.” Department of Education’s Rakwadu Circuit’s assistance director governance, Peter Masinamela, said they’re always happy to work with Mabilu. “When pupils are cared for, they do better in their exams. We hope the gifts will encourage them to focus on school. He is indeed a true leader,” said Masinamela.
