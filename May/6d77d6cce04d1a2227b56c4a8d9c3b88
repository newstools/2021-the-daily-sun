HAVE you noticed how long your family members tend to live? Besides the chronic illnesses along their life journey, do they live well into their retirement years? If you answered yes to both questions, then you will be glad to know that you might also live as long as they do. Yes, according to the latest health research, Long Life Family Study (LLFS) recently broadened their findings in a paper published in Gerontology, suggesting that people who belong to long-lived families also show slower cognitive decline over time. This simply means that there’s a correlation between your family’s life expectancy and your own. The Long Life Family Study enrolled more than 5 000 participants from almost 600 families, and has been following them for the past 15 years. The study was unique in that it enrolled individuals belonging to families with clusters of long-lived relatives. The LLFS recruited participants belonging to two groups: the long-lived siblings (also called the pro-band generation) and their children. “This finding of a slower decline in processing speed is particularly remarkable because the younger generation is relatively young at an average age of 60 years and therefore these differences are unlikely to be due to neurodegenerative disease,” explains corresponding author Stacy Andersen, PhD, assistant professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine. According to the professor, familial longevity demonstrates resilience to cognitive ageing. By studying the LLFS families, we can learn about the genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle habits that are essential in optimising cognitive health throughout the lifespan. Simply put, if we take a closer look at our immediate family lifespans, we should get a good idea of how long we can live, provided we take good care of ourselves.
