Members of the South African BDS Coalition gathered on the Durban Esplanade and Durban port to protest the docking of an Israeli ship and to boycott the offloading of the ship. The decision by Satawu and the BDS Coalition follows a call by the Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU) on workers and trade unions to refuse to unload Israeli ships and goods from sea and airports. The PGFTU said the boycotts are a result of the Israeli onslaught on Gaza, the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank, and the ethnic cleansing in occupied Jerusalem. More than 230 people have been killed, most of them civilians, including about 70 children, as well as the wholesale destruction by Apartheid Israel of infrastructure in Gaza, and a 14-year medieval-like siege of the territory. The Zim Shanghai, owned by Israeli state-owned company Zim Lines, docked in Durban on Wednesday night, 19 May. The action against the ship is part of a global set of actions against Zim Lines. #DockworkersWithPalestine - South African workers protest Israeli state owned ship docking in Durban! @BDSmovement pic.twitter.com/ogwIy1aLrv  The protests also target Transnet, demanding that the parastatal not allow goods to or from Israel to pass through South African ports. Earlier this week, workers in the Italian city of Livorno refused to load an arms shipment onto the Asiatic Island, another Zim Lines ship. HAPPENING NOW: Workers at the Durban harbour in South Africa have refused to offload an Israeli cargo ship and now protesting in support of #Palestine. #DockWorkersWithPalestine #FreePalestine pic.twitter.com/pkuQ1ACU0I  South African workers are not newcomers to action against Zim Lines. In February 2009, Sata members in Durban refused to offload a Zim Lines ship in protest against the 2008-2009 Israeli attack on Gaza.
