Sex should not only be a fun exercise but a fulfilling experience. If done frequently and the right buttons are pressed to activate the greatest orgasms, it can become the greatest paradise. Much like money, sex also makes the world go round and various countries do it more often than others. While sex is the act of human creation, the latest study reveals which countries love to get it on. According to a Durex global survey, a list was compiled of countries that are sexually satisfied. According to the survey, 26 000 people (aged 16 and older) surveyed by Durex in 26 countries, less than 50% were said to be fully satisfied with their sex lives. From its data, Durex determined that achieving orgasm is a key driver of sexual satisfaction. Just 48% of the global survey achieve an orgasm during sex. Globally, twice as many men (64%) as women regularly have orgasms. Here are the top 10 countries that are sexually satisfied: 10. Nigeria 9. Australia 8. India 7. Mexico 6. The Netherlands 5.
