THE Mpumalanga Hawks have launched a massive manhunt for a 38-year-old man suspected of fraud. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the suspect’s a financial administrator at the Barberton Mine. He’s wanted after he allegedly made an undue payment from the mine’s account and transferred it into his personal account as well as to two of his colleagues who have since been arrested and granted bail. “The trio colluded and prejudiced the Barberton Mine with a total loss of R1 156 700 through misrepresentation. The suspect transferred money from the Barberton Mine account to his personal account and further distributed it to different accounts. An internal investigation was conducted and the suspect disappeared. “A warrant of arrest was issued by the court on 5 November 2020 and he’s still on the run hence the Hawks is looking for him,” she said. Sekgotodi said the first suspect (36), a former mine administrator’s clerk, was arrested on 1 March for allegedly receiving undue payment of R497 885. She said the second clerk (30) was arrested on 11 May for his alleged link to a share of R300 000 received from his accomplices. They two appeared in the Barberton Magistrates Court and were released on R5 000 bail each. The case was postponed until 12 July for further investigation. Sekgotodi appealed to members of the public to help with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspect. Those with information are requested to contact the investigating officer, Captain Dietlof Meyer, on 071 481 2977. “The information will be treated with confidentiality,” said Sekgotodi
