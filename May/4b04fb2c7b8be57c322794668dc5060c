THE moment of truth has finally arrived in the GladAfrica Championship! Either Sekhukhune United or Royal AM will on Monday regard to themselves as PSL club. One team will gain automatic promotion to the DStv Premiership on Sunday, and two sides will confirm their place in the promotion play-offs. At the bottom of the log, either Cape Town City, Cape Town Spurs or Steenberg, will be relegated to the ABC Motsepe League to join already put down Bizana Pondo Chiefs. At the top, a dramatic ending is expected after between Sekhukhune and Royal AM. There was drama between the two sides this week and itâ€™s unclear how it will end up with the PSL having jumped into the bandwagon. Both teams will just need to win their respective matches to ensure a smooth sail into the money-spinning league. Royal AM host Cape Town All Stars at Chatsworth Stadium (3pm), while Sekhukhune are in Soshanguve for their fixture against JDR Stars at the Giant Stadium. Sekhukhune said they are not concerned, but ready for Sunday. They said the automatic promotion would be a bonus for them as a team that is on its first season in the GladAfrica.
