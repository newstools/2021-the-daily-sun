A HEAVY sentence is the only thing that will ease the Nxumalo family’s pain. This after their 12-year-old son, Azanhle, was allegedly killed by someone driving a state vehicle. The family from Mpophomeni in Howick, KZN midlands, said they were in pain as the person responsible for killing Azanhle was still not behind bars. Azanhle’s uncle Ndumiso Majola said as much as the driver’s arrest would never bring back his nephew, it would be better knowing that he was paying for what he did. “My nephew was knocked down by a government vehicle belonging to the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development. The driver is heartless. He didn’t even stop to help,” he said. Ndumiso said as days went by, they thought the department or driver would apologise, but no one did. “Not even a single official attended the funeral. An apology would have eased the pain because mistakes do happen,” said the uncle. “We can tell that the driver is not remorseful. We want him to rot in jail and pay for what he did. Our hearts will be at peace.” The department’s KZN MEC Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi said the employee involved in the crash was suspended pending an internal investigation. “We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the employee is brought to book if found guilty,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the incident took place on R617 Bulwer road. “A 36-year-old suspect was arrested by Mpophomeni police for culpable homicide and briefly appeared in the Howick Magistrates Court on 19 May. “The case was remanded to 8 July,” she said.
