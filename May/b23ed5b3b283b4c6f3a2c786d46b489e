GROWING up, Mogomotsi Magwai (32) felt suicidal and couldn’t understand why. That is, until people told him he had a VERY special gift. After doing research he eventually found his calling. He’s so far read the palms of more than 50 people, all of whom confirmed what he told them. Mogomotsi was raised in Majaneng in Hammanskraal but met people from all walks of life in 2015 while in Mauritius. He had gone to Mauritius for a stage play which he acted in.  “A woman once told me I had a long life, but I didn’t know what that meant,” he said. “In Mauritius I met a Nigerian man who said I had the power to see into the past, present and future by looking at people’s palms. “I was reading for fun, but in 2020 the actual training took place and I was taught the basics. “There was a situation where a child got lost and someone tagged me on Facebook. “When I got the name of the child and other information, I told the family they’d find the child at the border.”  He said the universe chose him to play his part with his gift of helping people. Asked what he could predict about Mzansi, Mogomotsi said: “I see this country being owned by three nations. But he refused to say who those three nations are. “We’ll continue to experience hardships, especially when it comes to this virus and money.”
