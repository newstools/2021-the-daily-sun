MURDER and attempted murder cases were opened for investigation after a shooting on Sunday afternoon at a car wash in Taurmaline Street in Bardale squatter camp in Mfuleni, Cape Town. A resident, who asked not to be named, said an off-duty cop took her vehicle to the car wash and was later shot dead by suspects asking about prices. “I think they were just checking the coast when they asked that. I heard that after asking questions one of the suspects drew a firearm and fired shots at the victim,” said the resident. Another resident said he saw an Avanza being driven at high speed. “I didn’t know what they did until I heard one of the residents saying they’re the ones who shot an off-duty cop along with her family,” said the resident. Other residents said the criminals did as they wish and called for harsher sentences. Captain FC van Wyk said a 50-year-old off-duty lieutenant-colonel attached to Delft Police Station was shot dead and her three-year-old grandson, as well as three others, was injured. “All injured victims were taken to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. The suspects fled the scene in a white Toyota Avanza and are yet to be arrested,” said Van Wyk. Cops are investigating.
