SUNSPORT has learnt that Kgoloko Thobejane is back at Baroka FC. According to the insider, Thobejane will coach the club’s DStv Diski coach. “Thobejane is back at Baroka,” said the mole. “It was announced today (Saturday) at Moshate Lodge.” Thobejane left Baroka in February 2018. However, because he wasn't happy at the way he was fired, he took the club to the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC). But the verdict came in favour of Baroka, when he was demanding the settlement. Thobejane was fired after he was found guilty of being allegedly drunk while on duty. But this is the thing of the past now as the coach and the club have ironed out their past problems. Thobejane’s return doesn’t come as a surprise to Baroka. He helped Bakgaga with the PSL promotion in 2015-16 season. Thobejane is the second individual to be brought back in the side. Both he and goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke were fired on the same reasons of being allegedly drunk while on the job. But the towering goalie is back in the club, having been brought back at the beginning of the season.
