THE ongoing Okae Molao operation targeting different areas identified as hot spots continues to yield positive results. The operation was being led by provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela and Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko in Cleveland and surrounding areas. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mazibuko said Kwa Mai Mai is a well-known market visited by many people daily. “This is a busy place, but none of the owners show any compliance. Some even told me they drink imbiza. Therefore, they are immune to Covid-19,” she said. She said none of that behaviour will be tolerated because Covid-19 is real and it kills.  “Not so long ago this place was trending on social media for hosting the mother of all parties. It’s alarming that our youth care less about their health,” she said. Officers checked all the businesses in the market area and found people selling alcohol without licences and confiscated all the liquor. Mazibuko said it was embarrassing to see old women and men acting like children when asked where their masks were. She said the third wave is looming in Gauteng yet people still want to play hide and seek with the police about their own health. “I can’t stress enough the importance of compliance. People must continue to sanitise, wash their hands regularly, social distance and keep their masks on in public,” she said.
