CAPE Town City chairman, John Comitis, said they will decide at the end of the current season on the future of winger Aubrey Ngoma, who is on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns. Ngoma, who joined Sundowns from City in the second half of the 2018-19 season, rejoined City on loan in the swap deal with Kermit Erasmus at the beginning of this season. However, he will see his contract end in June with Sundowns, but the reigning league champions inserted an option to renew it. “Ngoma, unfortunately it is Sundowns’ decision because he has an option for one more year,” said Comitis about Ngoma who is one of the founding members of City with over 100 appearances. “We will have to wait and see what happens because it is their decision. At this stage, we can’t comment further on that.” Meanwhile, Mpho Makola’s contract with City has been extended for another year. His contract was due end of June but he will remain with the Mother City club until June next year. “Makola has signed a new contract with us,” said Comitis. Makola joined City at the start of last season after leaving Pirates, whom he spent seven years with. Since Makola arrived at City, he has featured in 49 games with one goal to show.
