SOCIAL Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale said government alone would not be able to end gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF), as well as bullying until civil society and individual members joined hands in fighting these ills. Rakgoale was leading an anti-bullying and GBVF awareness campaign at the Thohoyandou Children’s Home on Friday. Partners such as the Pastors Forum, the police, NPOs, SGBs and school principals came to exchange ideas on how best to tackle GBVF and bullying at schools and in communities. She said Thohoyandou areas and communities in the Vhembe region had been declared a hot spot for GBVF, and urged such actions to stop. ALSO READ: MANHUNT AFTER COP KILLED, ANOTHER HURT! Recently, a pupil from Mbilwi Secondary School outside Thohoyandou, Lufuno Mavhunga, killed herself after a video of her being bullied by a fellow pupil went viral on social media. A teacher from the same school is in court on charges of raping a pupil. Meanwhile, Reverend Dr Alunamutwe Rannditsheni, who spoke on behalf of Vhembe Pastors Forum, said the church also had a role to play in the restoration of ubuntu among our communities. “As church leaders, we usually encounter our communities who come to us about gender-based violence, and we have to attend to them to save their lives. They are our people and we don’t have a choice, rather than attending to their problems for amicable solutions,” said Dr Rannditsheni.
