AMAPIANO waves are taking the world by storm. From stopping cars in traffic near the White House in Washington DC, to a trendy new viral dace challenge, there is nothing that it has not been able to achieve. After the Jerusalema challenge became one of the biggest things to come out of Mzansi, now the country has been participating in a new dance challenge called the #DakiweChallenge that has been inspired by DJ and music producer DBN Gogo, whose real name is Mandisa Radebe. DBN Gogo is the daughter of the former minister of energy Jeff Radebe and sheâ€™s best known for the hit songs such as Dakiwe, Khuza Gogo and French Kiss. Since the spark of the challenge, everyone took to social media to share their #DakiweChallenge videos.
