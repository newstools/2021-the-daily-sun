THREE alleged human traffickers, including a mother of a teenage victim, appeared in the Keiskammahoek Magistrates Court in the Eastern Cape on Friday, 28 May. Their case was postponed until 7 June to allow the trio, aged 32, 36 and 42, to apply for bail. Their appearance in court emanates from their arrest during a joint venture by the East London Serious Organised Crime Investigation team of the Hawks and King William’s Town K9 unit on Wednesday, 26 May. According to Hawks spokeswoman Yolisa Mgolodela, it’s alleged the 42-year-old mother of a girl (13) who suffers from down syndrome sold her and her 15-year-old niece to the two co-accused who are shop owners in Keiskammahoek for sexual exploitation. Mgolodela said the incident dates back to February 2019 while the victims were 11 and 13 years old, respectively, until they were taken away to a place of safety in March 2021. Mgolodela said the trio made a short appearance in court and were remanded in custody until their formal bail application.
