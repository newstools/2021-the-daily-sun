We've published the article "Couple in court for
rape!" on 04 May 2021 on our website. The article dealt with a couple who were back in court for
charges of rape, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, sexual
assault, and human trafficking. The ANC Women's League, Men's Sector, Women's
Sector, Treatment Action Campaign, Sanco, and Civil Society Forum members came
in big numbers to support the two raped and molested minors. We retract the article as we have named the suspects as they
have pleaded not guilty, but we referred in the article to their
"aunt" and therefore, indirectly named the victims.
