A woman was arrested during the early hours on Saturday after two getaway vehicles linked to a cash-in-transit heist were found on her property. According to police, a CIT vehicle was travelling on JB Marks Road towards President Hyper shopping centre in Fochville on the West Rand when a white Lexus rammed into them at around 11:00 on Friday. "The driver of the Lexus lost control and drove into the yard of a private premises. The driver of the CIT vehicle in the meantime managed to balance the CIT vehicle, but suspects in two other vehicles began shooting at the CIT vehicle forcing the driver to stop," police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said. "The suspects forced the driver and two security guards that were seated at the back out the CIT vehicle and disarmed them of three firearms and multiple rounds of ammunition." Naidoo said the suspects gained access to the money by using an explosive device. "They stole an undisclosed amount of cash before getting away in a white 3 series BMW and a white A3 Audi." Naidoo added that the driver of the CIT van was injured on his right arm during the heist. Police made the breakthrough hours after the CIT heist as the two getaway vehicles were found parked at a house in Carletonville on the West Rand. The owner of the house, a woman, was arrested for possession of suspected stolen vehicles and defeating the ends of justice, Naidoo said. "The two vehicles, a BMW, was reported hijacked in Brooklyn [Pretoria] in March this year and an Audi reported stolen in Garsfontein [Pretoria], also in March this year."
