MASKANDI artist Khuzani Mpungose will make a public apology to Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the Buthelezi clan. This apology will be made at eMahlabathini in KwaCeza Village on Wednesday, 26 May. The apology follows a video clip by Khuzani where he made fun of Buthelezi. The clip angered the Buthelezi Tribal Council youth leadership so much they called on the clan to distance itself from all businesses that work with Khuzani. Khuzani told Daily Sun the video was made in jest. But on Sunday, 23 May Khuzani’s traditional leader Chief Zakhe Mpungose said Khuzani would be brought before Buthelezi and the Buthelezi clan to apologise. “As the Mpungose clan, we reprimanded him and he realised his mistake,” said Mpungose. “He now understands that his joke was disrespectful and uncalled for.” ALSO READ |   WATCH: RAPPER AKA BARES IT ALL Buthelezi Tribal Council chairman Mziwandile Buthelezi told the People’s Paper they’d been communicating with Khuzani’s traditional leaders, his producer Shobeni Khuzwayo and with Khuzani. “They all agreed to bring him before Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the Buthelezi clan to make a formal and public apology. We felt it had to be done publicly because the joke was also made publicly,” said Mziwandile. Buthelezi’ deputy, Mpikayise Buthelezi, said the meeting was a formality as everything had been resolved. “We spoke to Khuzani and his team and he’s shown remorse. The prince has already forgiven him,” said Mpikayise. “Had he refused to apologise, he was going to have bad luck his entire life.”
