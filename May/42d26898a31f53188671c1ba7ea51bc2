There was a time when a shaved man was the apple of the eye for many women. While many of us may have different opinions about beards, the latest trends reveal women love men with beards. A new international study found that women perceive men with facial hair to be more attractive, as well as physically and socially dominant. According to Bigthink.com, women tend to associate more masculine faces with physical strength, social assertiveness, and formidability. New research on heterosexual mating preferences offers clues about why some women get excited over facial hair. Research conducted by Tessa R Clarkson at the University of Queensland measured womenâ€™s judgement of the attractiveness of men with varying levels of facial masculinity and beardedness. Furthermore, the evolution of facial hair used to demonstrate that a man is healthier, more socially dominant, and more masculine than other males. According to Medical Daily, beard length is a crucial component of attractiveness. Men with heavy 10-day stubble were ranked most attractive, while men with light stubble (five days of growth) got the lowest scores from both female and male participants. It seems the hairier the merrier for women.
