UNTIL the day he died, the 72-year-old madala complained that the mashonisa was robbing him. The mashonisa kept his ID book and his Sassa card. He allegedly took R800 a month from madala Mafika Ncala from Waterworks, near Soweto instead of the agreed R500. A close friend of the dead madala, Jan Mngomezulu (65), told Daily Sun the mashonisa had been doing this for three months. Another neighbour said the madala said he owed R2 000. “This mashonisa took advantage of the old man. The madala would even run out of food,” claimed the neighbour. Residents said the situation was bad for the madala. “He was not eating properly and he was depressed. Two weeks ago we found him dead in his shack,” said Jan. He said the madala never spoke about his family and nobody visited him. “We had to contribute money to bury him. We raised R5 000.” Jan said the mashonisa has disappeared with the ID and Sassa card. They told the People’s Paper they didn’t report him to the police. Patrick Gama, chairman of Sanco in Zuurbekom, said it was difficult to bury the madala. “After searching his shack, we found his voter registration card and ID number.” He said Home Affairs agreed to register his death. Community leader and Sanco treasurer in Gauteng, Ponds Petersen, said they spoke to the undertaker in Toekomsrus and gave the madala a decent burial. He was buried on 28 May. Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said it’s illegal for mashonisas to take Sassa cards.
