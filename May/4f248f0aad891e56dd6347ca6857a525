ELEVEN suspects have been arrested in connection with a series of murders that’s left the Khayelitsha community reeling in shock. The number of people who have died from the attack on Saturday, 15 May has increased to 13. Police ministry spokeswoman Lirandzu Themba said nine people were shot and killed at different locations in the Cape Town kasi over the weekend. “Four others succumbed to the injuries sustained from the shooting incidents in the hospital. Five people have been left seriously wounded after the multiple shootings,” she said. These incidents were believed to be linked to the ongoing extortion plaguing Cape Town areas. A task team including Lockdown II forces, intelligence officials and organised crime detectives bust the suspects at a Sea Point hotel at about 3am on Monday morning, 17 May. Themba said Minister Bheki Cele welcomed the arrests and that this would not have been possible without the extra resources pumped into the Western Cape.
