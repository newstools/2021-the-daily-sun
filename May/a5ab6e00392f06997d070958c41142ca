WHEN criminals vandalised Inkqubela LP School in KwaZakhele, Gqeberha over the weekend, it was not the first time. Two classrooms were vandalised. The school now has eight vandalised classrooms. On Monday, three tsotsis robbed the teachers at gunpoint. SGB chairwoman Charmaine Yani told Daily Sun they’ve been robbed more than 10 times in three years. “On Monday they came to the gate. They told me they’d come to rob us and forced me into the staff room. They took our phones, money, a laptop and a handbag,” she said. Her deputy Thembani Zicwele said they were worried because the neighbouring school, Thamsanqa High School, was vandalised and totally destroyed. “The department did not arrive today. We’re going to Coega Development to negotiate with the contractor nominated by the department to fence our school.” Provincial spokesman for the department Malibongwe Mtima said: “The fencing of the school has already been purchased and a contractor has been identified. “The project will start at the end of May. We urge the community to protect the school.” Police spokeswoman Sandra Janse van Rensburg confirmed the robbery. “Suspects pointed guns at five teachers and demanded their belongings. They fled with a laptop, five cellphones and a handbag.”
