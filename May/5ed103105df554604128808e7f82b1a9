KING Ndlovu has already started training with Orlando Pirates, to end speculation that he has moved to Soweto. It is unclear what's the length of his contract with Pirates, but SunSport can confirm that the 28-year-old Ndlovu is training under the tutelage eye of coach Josef Zinnbauer. The former Black Leopards goalkeeper can only start playing for the Buccaneers at the start of the 2021-22 DStv Premiership season. According to eye witnesses, Ndlovu started training with Pirates on Saturday, Sunday and on Monday morning. This was just two days after Pirates' 3-0 thrashing of relegation haunted Leopards, Ndlovu's former club, which is flirting with relegation. Pirates have been running short of goalkeepers since the injury to Richard Ofori who was whisked out of the playing in their goalless Confederation Cup draw with ES SÃ©tif due to groin injury. But the club have been leaking goals under Siyabonga Mpontshane and Wayne Sandilands, which goes without saying why Pirates opted for Ndlovu, who quit Leopards last month. Following threats by Leopards to suspend him for standing up his teammates who took part in an unauthorised Easter Weekend tournament, Ndlovu requested for his contract to be terminated and be given his clearance. It is unclear for how long will the 26-year-old Ofori be out of action, but indications are that he might be out for the remainder of the season. "He was introduced to all the players and coaching staff on Saturday. He will be joining a credible team of Pirates goalkeepers, but he is only eligible to play next season, according to football rules after his registration," our mole caughed. Fourth placed Pirates will on Tuesday play against relegation troubled Stellenbosch at the Danie Craven Stadium at 3pm.
