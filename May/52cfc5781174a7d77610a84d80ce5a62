HEALTH Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize can’t be player and referee when dealing with the Digital Vibes scandal. This is according to those who’ve been calling for him to step down since it emerged he has close ties with the owners of the company awarded an irregular tender by his department. Tshepo Matseba of reputation consultancy company Reputation 1st Group said the minister should step down to allow the probe to continue. “For the minister to regain his reputation and credibility, he would need to take some form of leave so there’s no perception that he interfered with the investigations,” he said.

Matseba told Daily Sun the minister had unfortunately already made the negative impression he was judge and jury in a matter involving his department. He acknowledged the good work the minister did in managing the Covid-19 pandemic. The DA’s Siviwe Gwarube said: “It can’t be that the very person entrusted with the Covid-19 response is embroiled in this kind of scandal involving public money.  Cope’s Dennis Bloem said: “If that doesn’t happen, the president must fire him.” Mkhize said: “The investigation found that the tender bidding followed was in contravention of the Public Finance Management Act. “The process of appointing Digital Vibes was irregular, the irregularities range from inconsistencies in the bidding committees, to lack of disclosure of conflict of interest.”
