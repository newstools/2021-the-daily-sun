KAIZER Chiefs will be without several key players, including Erick Mathoho and Itumeleng Khune when they tackle Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday (3pm). The club have released a list, which could easily pass for a hospital casualty ward, ahead of the crucial away fixture. Khune is still out with a shoulder injury. His replacement Daniel Akpeyi was stretched off at half time with concussion in their last match against Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday. Defender Mathoho needs seven for 10 days to recover from an ankle ligament injury.
