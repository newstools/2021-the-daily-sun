Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Thursday published its new Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) as approved by unanimous vote of the Members’ Council on 30 April. The MOI can be accessed on the CSA website: https://cricket.co.za/cat/23/About-CSA/7543/csa-moi/ “As I stated at last week’s landmark media briefing it is important in the interests of transparency that the new MOI is made available to all our stakeholders,” commented CSA Interim Board chair, Dr Stavros Nicolaou. “This includes our sponsors, our media, our players and, most importantly, the general public. “With the MOI now in place the Board can concentrate on one of the outstanding issues in its mandate from the Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, the planning of the Annual General Meeting which will take place on June 12.” CSA Acting President Mr Rihan Richards welcomed the publication of the new MOI. “This document is our constitution and brings us into line with the best standards of good corporate governance.” CSA Acting Chief Executive, Mr Pholetsi Moseki also highlighted the significance of this outcome. “The finalisation of this MOI is a very important milestone for CSA and for the sport of cricket and is one step that now paves a new growth pathway for our organisation and more importantly for our relationships with our partners, sponsors and all other stakeholders involved in the sport of cricket. “I am very excited about this achievement and, in particular, the fact that this MOI now removes all grey areas previously associated with the future of cricket. We look forward to the incoming new season and including all the positive energy that it promises.”
