BAROKA FC midfielder Thuso Mogale is optimistic that Bakgaga will end AmaZulu’s high-flying run! The Limpopo-based side travel to Durban to face Usuthu in their DStv Premiership encounter at King Zwelithini Stadium on Tuesday (3pm). Bafana Bafana legend Benni McCarthy has worked wonders with Usuthu, who have recorded 16 consecutive league matches without a loss. AmaZulu have been enjoying a good run of form since McCarthy took over the helm from Ayanda Dlamini last December. McCarthy’s team are now challenging for the championship with leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. The KwaZulu-Natal based side’s impressive displays have also saw them win the Premiership Q-3 Innovation, pocketing R1.5 million last week after collecting 20 points in eight matches. Usuthu are second on the log with 50 points from 26 matches. They are only four points behind the Brazilians. But AmaZulu have played one more game compared to the defending Premiership champions. The last time AmaZulu lost a league match was their 1-0 defeat against Kaizer Chiefs in Durban on 13 January. But the 19-year-old star Mogale believes Baroka will bring AmaZulu down to earth tomorrow. “AmaZulu are a good side and they have been doing well since Benni took over,” said Mogale. “They (AmaZulu) are now fighting for the PSL title with Sundowns. But we also have a good team that is fighting for a top eight position. It will be a tough game tomorrow but I am confident that we will come home with a positive result. “It is easier to play a team that is doing well than a struggling side. We are going there (Durban) aiming for three points to boost our chances of ending the season in the top eight.” Baroka are 10th on the log with 29 points from 26 league matches. They are only three points behind eighth placed TS Galaxy. A win tomorrow would see them move level on points with Galaxy. The last time these two sides clashed in a league encounter AmaZulu managed a 2-0 win at Peter Mokaba Stadium on 23 January.
