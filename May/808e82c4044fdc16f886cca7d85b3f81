PEOPLE can naturally be afraid of snakes, and this type of phobia is called ophidiophobia. It stems from the overall perception that one has of their type of reptile. The same can be said about someone who has a fear of the 4-5, as weird as that may sound. Some people have a genuine fear of this phallic structure. Ever heard of phallophobia? In its narrower sense, this is a fear of the erect penis, and in a broader sense, an excessive aversion to masculinity. According Healthline magazine, this phobia can impact both women and men. A person with phallophobia is afraid of seeing an erect 4-5, either through clothing or without it. Some are also afraid of touching it. A woman may feel threatened by the erect 4-5 because of sexual abuse or rape in the past. Even seeing a manâ€™s erect 4-5 through clothing can cause a panic attack in such cases. Men with phallophobia often feel embarrassed by it. According to Fear.net, men who suffer from this may have been teased or made to feel ashamed by it. Culture and religion can also be a factor in phallophobia, with some religions looking down upon sexual intercourse. Many religious texts state that sex is only necessary for reproduction and should not be viewed as a means of pleasure. Orthodox or overly religious parents may teach their children that sex is dirty.
