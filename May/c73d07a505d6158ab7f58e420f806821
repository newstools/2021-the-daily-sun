ANGRY Marikana residents in North West marched to Samancor Chrome in Brits to hand over a memorandum. They were demanding jobs, skills upliftment as well as business opportunities and funding for young people who wanted to study further. They said they were not given jobs by the mine because they were told they didn’t fit into the its 50 kilometre radius condition, but they claimed they did. They said they were also skilled and qualified but didn’t understand why they were being sidelined. Community leader Xolani Mangethe said they had tried to engage with the mine on these issues but with no success. “Our burning issue is that as the community of Marikana we are not given jobs, especially in mining. But we don’t understand why Samancor refuses to let us into the mine. We need jobs as well as business opportunities. “The mine always posts job advertisements which demand experience. We have youth who are in grade 12 or have only grade 12 that need skill development. The mine only needs to provide skill development projects to locals as preparation for future employment,” he said. They were unable to present their memorandum as no one was willing to talk to them. A statement released by Samancor Chrome said the mine was aware of the march that took place. But further said it was an illegal march because the community members failed to apply for section 4 of the Regulation of Gatherings Act 205 of 1993.
