THE IFP in Gauteng will officially launch the volunteers for their election drive ahead of the 2021 Local Government Elections. The volunteers will be announced by the party’s provincial executive committee and the provincial party leadership. The launch will be held at the Mapetla Sports Ground in Soweto today, 8 May. All IFP provincial party structures and supporters are invited to attend the launch. “The launch is a step towards intensifying the IFP’s election strategy to expand its footprint across Gauteng municipalities. It builds on the party’s electoral success during the 2016 Local Government Elections, where the IFP emerged as a kingmaker and eventually became part of a coalition government in the City of Johannesburg,” said the party’s provincial secretary, Alco Alderman Ngobese He said all Covid-19 regulations will be observed during the launch. “The party will encourage social distancing, mask wearing and hand sanitising at the venue,” said Ngobese.
