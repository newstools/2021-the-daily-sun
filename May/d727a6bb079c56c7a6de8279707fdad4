MAMELODI Sundowns coach Manqoba Mngqithi says it was inappropriate for Gaston Sirino to don Al Ahly colours in Cairo after their 2-0 defeat last weekend. The Uruguayan forward was pictured leaving the pitch wearing Ahly's jersey at the end of their quarter-final first leg. Before the season started, speculations were rife that Sirino was touted by Ahly with his club confirming negotiations. But the club terminated negotiations in December with Ahly over the potential sale of the Uruguay forward. Despite having downplayed it, Mngqithi said: "I don't think it is appropriate to do that (wearing Aly jersey). But it is something I don't want to dwell much on.” He said he wants to win their second leg against Africa’s Club of the Century at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (3pm) than dwell on politics of the game. “I can say something negative about the same player and on Saturday he wins the match for us," he said.

I'm very focused on keep playing well to appear and then we'll see what happens. "I want to thank the Al Ahly fans for their love. It would be a great challenge if I could someday wear this shirt."
