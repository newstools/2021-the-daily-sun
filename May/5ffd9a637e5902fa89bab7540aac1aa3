THE Klassen family in Samora Machel squatter camp in Cape Town was almost killed by vutha. Sumikazi Klassen (60) said she noticed smoke in the house at 5am and started screaming. She said: “I don’t know what woke me up. “Maybe it was my ancestors. They saved me and my family. “I’m grateful we’re alive. But who wanted to kill my family? Who hates me this much?” She said they couldn’t save anything. “It was vutha because the fire fought with everyone who tried to put it out. “No one was cooking at the time, so there was no problem with electricity. That’s why I think it was vutha.” She asked SunReaders for help. A resident said: “We saw the fire early and we went to help. But that didn’t help as the fire burnt down two other shacks.” Yolanda Mayongwana said they tried to put out the fire. “It was vutha sent to kill them. We tried everything to put out the fire, but failed,” said Yolanda. “It’s very stressful to lose everything. It will be very difficult for them to get back on their feet. I pray they get help.” Jeramie Carelse from the city’s fire and rescue services said firefighters from Ottery, Gugulethu and Mitchells Plain were on the scene. “The fire was contained at 6.54am. Ten people were displaced,” he told Daily Sun. He said four shacks and a brick house were affected.
