Whether you touch the sky with Sky Vodka or jam to the amapiano smash hit Tanqueray, you are almost guaranteed a toast to a good time. While it’s always advisable to enjoy your alcohol responsibly, a lot of women seem to be enjoying it more than their male counterparts. So, what are women drinking as their favourite alcohol beverages? Well, according to the latest research by Atomik Research, women love their gin and vodka more than the other types of alcohol. Gin is the drink on everyone’s mind lately as sales of the spirit have been at a record high. According to HM Revenue and Customs and the Wine and Spirits Trade Association, the UK now for instance has 315 distilleries in operation, which is more than double the 152 in operation five years ago. Atomik Research polled 2 000 people for Maverick Drinks to find out exactly why gin is so popular. Nearly 59% of those gin drinkers said they prefer the spirit because of the variety of flavours available, and 42% feel there is a larger variety of gin on offer than any other spirit. In fact, the most popular drink from the last 12 months were gin 32% and vodka 32% officially tying them for first place. Whisky was another front runner, with 30% of people putting that at the top of their lists. The survey also compared how different age groups feel about gin. Unsurprisingly, the majority of over 45 year olds agreed their favourite spirit is gin and the over 55’s have drunk more gin in the last 12 months than any other age group, with 30% choosing gin over any other spirit. There was also a gender divide when it comes to gin consumption. More women prefer gin to men, and twice as many women choose gin as their favourite spirit 26% to men at 13%. More women are also influenced by the gin on offer when choosing a venue than men.
