I’m a woman and my heart bleeds when I picture a young girl being raped. Some men don’t qualify to be called men. They’re a disgrace. It left me in tears when I read about two schoolteachers who allegedly took turns raping a 13-year-old girl. You wonder if everything is fine in their heads. It’s just mind boggling that two adults who’re in positions of authority in society would do such a thing yet see nothing wrong with it. It’s so sad that communities still experience such injustices. Our justice system should be harsh on barbarians. You’re a teacher and have been entrusted with the responsibility to protect our children and you decide to be the source of the very same pain we don’t want. Even jail isn’t enough. You belong somewhere in a dark pit where you’ll never be able to see any woman or girl again. We have so many challenges as a country that we shouldn’t have to face such acts. Morwe, Lephalale I can feel your frustrations and anger, Matlou. This is beyond shocking. It’s downright disappointing because schools are supposed to be among the safest places for our children. We really need to look deeper as a nation. Something is wrong. This letter wins R200. Call Cheryl at the office to collect you prize. – Deputy Editor
