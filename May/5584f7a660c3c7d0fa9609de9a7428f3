THERE are fears that alcohol restrictions may be imposed as Mzansi heads towards the third wave. However, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has urged the government to reject any calls to ban alcohol sales as coronavirus cases start to peak. DA shadow minister of trade, Dean Macpherson said they had taken note of radical proposals brought forward by the Southern African Alcohol Policy Alliance (Saapa), which seeks to halt the sales of alcohol without any public participation process or oversight of members of Parliament.

He said the country would not be having any fear of an alcohol ban if the government had embarked on a meaningful vaccination programme. “This last weekend, a mere 5 601 people were vaccinated. That is where all of government’s energy should be focused on, not on entertaining undemocratic proposals such as the one from Saapa,” Macpherson added.
