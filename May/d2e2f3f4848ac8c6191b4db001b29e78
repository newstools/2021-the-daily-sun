GAUTENG DA leader Solly Msimanga is nursing wounds on his face. The former mayor of Tshwane was moered by a man who alleged that he owed him R1,4 million. A video of Msimanga with blood dripping from his lips is making the rounds on social media. In the video, the man who beat him up can be heard telling Msimanga not to turn the incident into a political matter as he was merely asking for his money. “I want my money. Where’s my R1,4 million? You’re corrupt and I’m going to beat you some more. Ungijwayela gabi!” said the man. Msimanga is heard making a call and asking for a reference number, and denying that he owes the man money. The incident looks like it happened at a warehouse as machinery can be seen in the background. DA's Fred Nel said Msimanga was attacked for trying to help his cousin.  He said the incident happened on Thursday afternoon at the cousin's place in Johannesburg. He said the man who attacked Misamanga is a business partner of Msimanga's cousin. "He was attacking his cousin when Solly intervened and was attacked too. He made these allegations that Solly owed him and filmed him while he was calling the police," he said. He said the man was taken away by the police and has since apologised to Msimanga.
