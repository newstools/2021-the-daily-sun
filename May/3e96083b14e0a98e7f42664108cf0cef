A sergeant attached at Elsies River SAPS in Cape Town is
expected to appear in Goodwood Magistrate court on Monday. This is after he was
bust at his house in Belhar on Friday on allegations of supplying drugs in
cells and prisons. Cops spokesman Brigadier Novela Potelwa said the arrests are
part of ongoing efforts to clean the rot out of the police force. “The
31-year-old sergeant working at Elsies River SAPS was arrested at his home in
Belhar on Friday after he allegedly supplied drugs to prisoners in court and in
police cells. He will appear in the Goodwood Magistrate’s court on Monday,”
said Potelwa. SAPS had their hands full this week from arresting their
members. On Friday a 26-year-old constable from Kleinvlei cop shop was bust for
shooting and injuring a woman, an incident that happened in 2020. He was also
charged for driving a state vehicle without consent as well as intimidation of
a police officer. Potelwa said both cops to appear in different courts on
Monday 24 May. “A constable and a sergeant are expected to appear in the Blue
Downs and Goodwood courts respectively on Monday following their arrest on
charges of attempted murder, intimidation, and driving a state vehicle without
consent for one as well as dealing in drugs for the other. This happens after four cops from Harare SAPS in Khayelitsha
were arrested earlier this week and appeared Khayelitsha Magistrate Court for
corruption allegations. The arrested
cops  are Thandubuzwe Mretsu, Patience
Nolundi Quba and Ntsikelelo Matyila and Zweledinga Sontshalabe. Mretsu, Matyila
and Sontshalabe are charged with corruption and theft while Qubu is charged
with pointing a firearm. Their case has been postponed to 24 May 2021 for the
outcome of an identity parade.
