GRANTS beneficiaries were shattered after learning Sassa had cut the Covid-19 social relief grant of R350 on Friday, 30 April. The announcement was made on Thursday, 29 April. Unemployed mum, Thandi Silinda (35) of Somerset near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga said: “This is partially unfair for Sassa to stop the grant. It helped me a lot as my kids don’t have a father. So we relied on the grant. Although it was little, we never slept hungry.” Jeffrey Mathebula (37) said he and his family of five survived on the grant after he lost his job at the beginning of the lockdown. “I lost my job earlier last year. At least I could help my family with the R350 grant money. So it’s my strongest appeal that the government extends its period again. “Many companies have forever closed and some are still struggling to recovery. People are not as giving when we beg them for money or food due to this difficult situation we are all going through,” he said. Sassa acting spokesman Moabi Pitsi said: “The special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress Grant of R350 came to an end on Friday, 30 April. This means that no new applications will be accepted after this date. However, all applications which have been approved and of people who have not yet received the money will still be paid.” Pitsi said people who had their applications declined for the period from February to April 2021 may appeal. “They may appeal by going to the website at https://SRD.sassa.gov.za and follow the links for reconsideration. If the appeal is not lodged, the declined application will not be reconsidered. The appeal period closes on 31 May 2021. No appeals will be accepted after this date,” said Pitsi.
