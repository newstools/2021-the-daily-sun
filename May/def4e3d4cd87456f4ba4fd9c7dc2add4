BELEAGUERED Kaizer Chiefs veteran Bernard Parker is aware of the threat posed by Simba SC, but remains confident of victory. The two sides face off in the historic Caf Champions League quarterfinal tie on Saturday evening (6pm) at FNB Stadium. Like Simba, Chiefs have reached the quarterfinals for the first time in their history. Amakhosi have been battling to maintain consistency in the DStv Premiership. However, they have done well in the continental showpiece. The 35-year-old Parker said they are well aware of Tanzanian outfit Simba, who beat Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly 1-0 in the group stages and finished at the top of Group A. “We’ve watched a few clips on how they approach their matches. They’re physical‚ they’re strong‚ they have got wingers who come inside,” Parker said on Friday during a virtual press conference. “I don’t want to give too much away‚ but they are a very good side. They’re well organised and they are also direct. We are well aware they are a strong team but we are also a strong team.” Parker believes Amakhosi have been tested in the competition thus far. Playing tough opponents will not be something new for them when they face Simba. He stated: “We’ve played in difficult games throughout this competition so it’s nothing new. It’s for us to stick together and be the best we can be.” Simba will hope to maintain the solidity they showed in the group stage, where they only conceded two goals and kept four clean sheets.
