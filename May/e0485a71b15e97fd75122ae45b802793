AMAZULU maintained their unbeaten run in the DStv Diski Challenge Rewired to set a date with Mamelodi Sundowns in the final. Usuthu defeated Sundowns 4-3 on penalties after the two sides played to a 1-1 draw regularly. Chiefs could have wrapped up things in the second half of the match, considering the created changes. Amakhosi were the first to find the back of the net on the 25th minute through Tshepo Mohlala. However, their lead was short-lived as Usuthu managed to get an equaliser 10 minutes later when Msindisi Ndlovu combined with Lindokuhle Zungu, who scored for Usuthu. The two sides went to the break tied on 1-1. In the second half, there was not much of an action, the match's tempo dropped, and not many chances were created. The match had to be decided on penalties where Usuthu managed to convert four while Chiefs scored three. AmaZulu goalkeeper Olwethu Mzimela played a sterling role saving Kamohelo Hoala penalty. Chiefs captain Sabelo Radebe had missed the first penalty. Usuthu will now be hoping for a historic run by winning the cup without a defeat. However, it will not be a walk in the park for them against Sundowns. The final is scheduled for next Sunday (30 May), the venue and time will be announced by the Premier Soccer League (PSL) midweek. Earlier on, the daily Sundowns defeated Cape Town City 3-2 in a nail-biting semi-final. Siyanda Nyanga, Musawenkosi Mdhluli and Simnikiwe Mbonde were all on the scorecard for Sundowns, while Taahier Goedeman scored the brace for The Citizens. Unfortunately, his brace was not enough to send them to the final of the Diski Rewired.
