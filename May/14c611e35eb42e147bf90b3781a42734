SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo has joined the chorus of most coaches as he blames injuries to key players, and lack of depth as reasons for his side’s slump in the second round of DStv Premiership. Tembo said this on Wednesday after his side lost 3-1 to city rivals Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Stadium. The defeat handed Downs their fourth consecutive title. Tembo’s boys have won just one match in their last nine outings, which has dented their hopes of finishing the season in the top two. Matsatsantsa a Pitori dropped from fifth to sixth spot on the league table on 41 points – with two games still to play. Said Tembo: “I think we started the season very well. “If you look at the make-up of our team, we do not have a lot of depth. We lost a few key players due to injury like Bradley Grobler, Gabuza (Thamsanqa) who is only coming back now. He had his first start after three months. “Even Guily Manziba (who was sent-off in the first half) was injured as well, so it was a bit difficult.” Tembo stressed that youngsters struggled to be consistent after being thrown in the deep end. He went on: “We had to play more younger players. That’a when you see Jessy Don and young Keenan Phillips playing more regularly. “That’s why we struggled in terms of consistency. But I’m happy with where we’re going because we’ve given opportunities to other players, while some grabbed opportunities.” The Zimbabwean born mentor revealed that scoring goals was one of their main obstacles this season. Tembo hopes they will wrap up the season on a positive note at the expense of Maritzburg United and Chippa United, who are desperate for points to avoid relegation. They will meet Maritzburg at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday, and face the Chilli Boys at the Nelson Mandela Bay on 5 June.
