DAILY Sun is turning 19 years old on 2 July. To celebrate our 19th birthday, we’re giving away R100 000 to 10 lucky Daily Sun readers starting this Friday. Our SunPower birthday bonanza competition is meant to give deserving readers a financial boost because we know what a difficult time we’ve all been experiencing under this pandemic. Do you know anyone in your family or community who has devoted their time to inspire and improve the lives of others, and can use a break? Are you that person who desperately needs a leg up to make some of your dreams come true? In the next five weeks we will be giving one lucky reader R10 000 every Friday. On our birthday on 2 July, we will give a whooping R50 000 to five readers. To You, our most valued partner, we say Siyabonga!! Enter the competition now and send us your story on why you deserve to win on our WhatsApp line : 076 784 9619. Join us in our birthday celebrations and WIN!!
