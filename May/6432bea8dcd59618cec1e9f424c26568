WITH a big smile the estate agent opened the door to potential buyers. But the buyers turned out to be robbers! They produced guns and locked the estate agent and her three colleagues in a room before helping themselves to office equipment worth R75 000 and cellphones worth R24 000. The three suspects fled in a car and police from Springs cop shop, Ekurhuleni are looking for them. Captain Johannes Ramphora said no shots were fired and a case of business robbery was opened on Tuesday, 11 May. Ramphora said the victims told them the estate agent was standing in front of her desk when two men arrived at the locked security door. They pretended to be interested in buying a house. “She pressed the buzzer and opened the door for them. “Once inside they produced pistols and instructed the woman to join her colleagues in the back office. One of them cocked the pistol and told them they won’t get hurt if they co-operate,” he said. The victims were told to sit on the floor and face the wall while the suspects took two HP and one Innova laptops worth about R75 000 from their desks. The suspects also took two iPhones, a Samsung and a Huawei cellphones all worth about R24 000, and R500 cash from one of the victim’s wallet. After that they walked away. “A neighbour’s CCTV camera showed them leaving in a white VW Jetta that was waiting in front of the property. “The registration number was not visible,” said Ramphora.
