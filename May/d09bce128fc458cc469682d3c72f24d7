The Zulu royal house needs to unite and stop fighting for the throne. The family has confirmed that the fight over who should succeed King Goodwill Zwelithini is now heading to court. What they’re doing is unfair to the late king, who managed the family well. The squabbles and divisions affect the Zulu nation. They should have tried to resolve their differences internally. It’s sad for the nation that during the mourning period and death of the queen, one section of the family is fighting the rest. They must address this issue as soon as possible. When the royal family is fighting, the nation suffers because they become divided. Succession planing is important and royal families must prioritise it. This sometimes gets worse in polygamous marriages. The nation wants a leader and for the family to resolve their problems amicably. Letter by Norman Maake Tembisa
