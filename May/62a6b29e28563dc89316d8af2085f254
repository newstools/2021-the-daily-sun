ACTIVIST and author Zulaikha Patel has a lot to celebrate. Her children’s book My Coily Crowny Hair, released a few months ago, is now a bestseller. She took to social media to celebrate the milestone. “My book is officially a bestseller at CNA Africa. This one was only possible because of you. Ngiyathokoza,” she wrote. Zulaikha became a force to be reckoned with when she and her schoolmates stood up against anti-black hair policies at Pretoria High School for Girls six years ago.

At the age of four I’d already started reading, and by the time I was in primary school I was already a fluent reader,” she said. She said it took two years to complete the book. “I started writing the book in grade 11, and the process was challenging because it was the first time I was going to be speaking to young children,” she said. “So I had to be cautious and make sure they understood every sentence. I hope the book creates meaningful conversations between parents and children.” The 19-year-old said she’s in the process of releasing two more books, another children’s book and a memoir.
