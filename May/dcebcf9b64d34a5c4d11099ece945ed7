A DRUNK motorist who couldn’t even stand on his own when stopped by cops told the famous excuse: he’d only had two beers. But a breathalyser test told a different story. That was during a road block set up on Alexandra’s busy London Road. A total of 16 drunk drivers were nabbed while others were arrested for various crimes including housebreaking and possession of illegal firearms. A man in his late 30s, arrested with an illegal firearm and rounds of ammunition, told police the gun didn’t belong to him. But he failed to explain how it ended up in his vehicle. Gauteng police commissioner Elias Mawela said they decided to go to Alexandra because of the rising Covid-19 numbers and crime in the area. “Alexandra, together with Sandringham and Sandton, is one of the crime hotspots, especially hijacking of courier trucks and vehicles targeting mostly women.” After pulling over several taxis, Mawela said Covid-19 compliance inside was non-existent. “The majority of taxi operators, based on what I get from passengers, are no longer complying. They’ve dropped their guard and no longer sanitising passengers.” He said they planned to curb the high crime levels in the area. “We’ve increased our ground coverage in terms of crime intelligence, so that they work in gathering information to empower the operatives.” Mawela said they’d identified certain groups in the community. “The net is closing in on them,” he said.
