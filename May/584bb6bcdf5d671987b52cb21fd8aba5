 TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila are the Nedbank Cup Champions!The Limpopo based side proved to be a perfect example of the saying, "it is not about how you start, but how you end".In their first-ever match in the top-flight, an MTN8 quarter-final fixture, the then troubled TTM played the game and lost to SuperSport United with only three players on the bench.Nevertheless, after a long, uneasy battle, the players rewarded themselves with the Nedbank Cup title and R7 Million cheque when they beat Chippa United 1-0 at Free State Stadium.Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo scored the only goal of the match in the 27th minute of the first half.Ndlondlo has been one of the key players for the Limpopo based outfit on the day he continued with his sterling performances and was voted man of the match.Undoubtedly this will go down in the history book as they won the Ke Yona trophy on their first-ever season in the DStv Premiership after buying the franchise of Bidvest Wits. Talking to SuperSport Tv after the match, proud TTM coach Dylan Kerr gave credit to his players, saying they deserve it.Kerr stated: "We had to dig in deep. Credit to my players all the staff, Mpho Maleka, Dvd (Mathebula). It is an excellent achievement for TTM. The players have gone through a lot. They really deserve this.  "We have always said, the trophy is what we needed, going to Caf Confederation is a bonus." The victory means TTM will make their debut in the continental competition next season as they qualify for Caf Confederations Cup. Howvere, now they will have now cut their celebrations short, switch focus on saving the top-flight club status. They are currently in position 14 with 25 points from 25 matches. They need to win three remaining games to escape relegation and relegation play-offs.
