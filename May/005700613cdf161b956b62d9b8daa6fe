Mamelodi Sundowns will be crowned 2020-21 DStv Premiership champions if they beat Tshwane rivals SuperSport United in their clash at Loftus Stadium on Wednesday, and co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi says his side are determined to get the job done. Sundowns will also be confirmed, realistically at least, as league winners in defeat if AmaZulu don’t beat Orlando Pirates on Thursday given The Brazilians’ vastly superior goal-difference. But Mngqithi says they don’t want to rely on results elsewhere to lift the trophy and following their CAF Champions League quarterfinal exit at the hands of Al Ahly at the weekend, want to secure the silverware themselves as quickly as possible. "We are focused on the next assignment which is SuperSport,” he said. “We could see at training that the intensity was good. We know Sundowns want to win and are not used to losing two games in a row, so we have a responsibility to try and come back as quickly as possible. "For us it's always important to focus on the process. According to our process this is the second match of the last five games. We have won the first one and all our attention that we achieve our desired targets. “It just so happens that SuperSport can decide the championship, but the intention is to get the amount of points that we set out from the beginning. "We not looking towards this game as anything different. We not putting any pressure on the players that this is a title decider. We want them to give the same energy in the other matches. It is very important for us to win every match we play and to achieve our targets." Sundowns are seeking an unprecedented fourth league title in a row, but it will be a first for the co-coaching duo of Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena. -SuperSport
