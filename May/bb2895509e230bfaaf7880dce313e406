THE Covid-19 situation in India has the whole world worried as thousands of people die because of the deadly virus. With desperate times calling for desperate measures, some people have resorted to unprecedented measures to protect themselves against the Covid-19. Some Indians have went as far as applying cow dung on their bodies as a preventative measure against the virus. This is an interesting way of using cow dung, but it may not be able to protect the people from Covid-19. Reuters reports that doctors in India are warning against the practice of using cow dung in the belief it will ward off Covid-19, saying there is no scientific evidence for its effectiveness and that it risks spreading other diseases.  The publication further states that in the state of Gujarat in western India, some believers have been going to cow shelters once a week to cover their bodies in cow dung and urine in the hope it will boost their immunity against, or help them recover from, the coronavirus.  “We see ... even doctors come here. Their belief is that this therapy improves their immunity and they can go and tend to patients with no fear,” said Gautam Manilal Borisa, an associate manager at a pharmaceuticals company, who said the practice helped him recover from Covid-19 last year.
