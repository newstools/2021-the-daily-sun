AL Ahly have messed up an opportunity to close the gap on log leaders Zamalek as Pitso Mosimaneâ€™s side lost 1-0 to Ghazl El Mahalla in their Egyptian Premier League on Monday. Even though they still have two games in hand, Mosimane will be concerned with the inconsistency which has seen his side drop five points in their last two matches. In fact, Mosimane tasted his first ever league defeat when his Red Devils went down 2-1 to Smouha two weeks ago. Despite the shock loss to Mahalla, however, Ahly still have the league title destiny in their own hands.
