BAROKA suffered a major blow ahead of their crucial DStv Premiership Limpopo derby against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at Peter Mokaba Stadium tomorrow (3pm). Bakgaga, who are fighting to end this season in the top eight will miss the services of their key midfielder Tshediso Patjie. According to Baroka head coach Thoka Matsimela, the 30-year-old star started to experience health problems after their 1-0 win against AmaZulu in a league encounter last week. “Patjie has not been feeling well and he will not be available for tomorrow,” said Matsimela. “We are going to miss him. We are at a stage where we need all our key players for these last three games. I think he might be available for our last two matches. But let’s wait and see how he recovers.” Matsimela, who is in his debut season as a coach in top flight was also full of praise for his players after the club collected 32 points with three matches left to end the season. “Last season we ended with 29 points after 30 matches,” explained Thoka. “This season we have 32 points from 27 matches which is an improvement. Our aim now is to fight for all nine remaining points and finish in the top eight.” The last time Baroka ended the season with more than 30 points was in the 2017-18 season when they collected 34 points. Victory for the Ga-Mphahlele based-side tomorrow will see them occupy eighth spot. “It has not been an easy season for us,” said Matsimela. “I think we lost some games we could have won. But for me, it has been a learning curve and I am sure next season we will do better than this campaign.”
