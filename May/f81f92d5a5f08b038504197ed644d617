The NPA has confirmed that Bishop Israel Makamu was indeed
arrested earlier today with charges of sexual assault. Phindi Mjonondwane said Makamu was arrested after a former
employee of his church laid a complaint of sexual assault on 19 May 2021 at the
Brackendowns South African Police Service (SAPS). "The case relates to an incident that allegedly
happened in his church office in Alrode during September 2018," said
Phindi. She laid charges after an audio clip that went viral on
social media, exposing the bishop of allegedly asking for a poke. She also told Daily Sun that the case was remanded to 13
July 2021 for further investigations. "The Palm Ridge Magistrates' Court released Bishop
Israel Makamu on R2000 bail following a brief appearance on a charge of sexual
assault," said Phindi. The Father of the girl said he doesn't have much to say but
they'll have to see how the law proceeds with this case. He just hopes that his
daughter will get justice. Daily tried to contact Makamu several times but we
couldn't get hold of him.
