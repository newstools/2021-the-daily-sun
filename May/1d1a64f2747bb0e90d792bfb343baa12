MARITZBURG United’s chances of survival have suffered a major blow with the news that striker Ali Jose Meza will be out for nine months with a bad knee injury. The relegation-threatened Team of Choice discovered that Meza, who joined the club from Mamelodi Sundowns at the beginning of the season, had damaged his anterior cruciate knee ligaments. Meza recently had an operation on the injury and will be sidelined for up to nine months. The 30-year-old Uruguayan striker picked up the injury against Orlando Pirates on 18 April. Meza has scored two goals in 22 matches, including in the club’s biggest win over Chippa United (5-1) last month, and will be missed in Maritzburg’s relegation battle. Maritzburg host third-placed Golden Arrows in a KZN derby at Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday (3pm), looking to bounce back after losing 2-0 away to leaders Downs in their previous match last Wednesday. But there is good news with the return to training of Mxolisi Kunene after recovering from a bad injury he sustained at the end of last season, which has sidelined him for the entire 2020-21 season. Coach Ernst Middendorp, who has also seen players like Kwanda Mngonyama and Phumlani Ntshangase suffering major injuries this season, said the show must go on as he targets 30 points to retain the club’s PSL status. Martizburg are in 13th position with 25 points, only one ahead of second bottom Chippa with five games left to play. “It is unusual to build a team in the middle of the season and so far so good,” said Middendorp, who parted ways with Keagan Buchanan and Pogiso Sanoka in the January transfer window. “But we know our quality. We are not dreaming about top eight or top seven. For us it is crucial to work hard in the remaining five games to get five points and the safety mark of 30 points.”
