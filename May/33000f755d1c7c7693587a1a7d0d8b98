AFTER a year of being stuck indoors, last night Mzansi’s A-listers came out in numbers wearing their best outfits to witness the best in the film and television industry being honoured. The annual South African Film and Television Awards (Saftas) took place and this year’s ceremony that was hosted by media personality Dineo Langa alongside comedian Mpho “Popps” Modikoane and Graeme Richards. Tshedza Pictures, which is the production company behind The River and The Legacy, dominated the ceremony after scooping 12 awards. Menzi Ngubane, who died earlier this year after succumbing to stroke related complication, won an award posthumously for his role as Judas Ngwenya on the canned telenovela Isibaya, while Sindi Dlathu scooped the Best Actress award for her role as Lindiwe Dikana on The River. Another big win for the night was Netflix’s comedy series How to Ruin Christmas: The Wedding, which walked away with eight awards including the Best Actress-TV Comedy award and Best Supporting Actor-TV Comedy.

The much-loved telenovela won the public vote for Best Telenovela/TV Soap. Congratulating the winners, National Film & Video Foundation CEO Makhosazana Khanyile said: “SAFTAs 15, what an amazing win for the industry we serve! I’d like to congratulate all the winners as well as our valued partners, especially our broadcast partners, Mzansi Magic and S3.” “It truly is an honour for the NFVF to be the custodians of the SAFTAs and to watch the industry grow and flourish. Amidst a global pandemic, our artists persevered, entertained, and challenged themselves and this can be witnessed in the number of nominees that this year witnessed. I’m grateful for the industry that continues to walk the SAFTAs journey with us and true to this year’s theme, the industry is absolutely still shining.” Best Short Film Address Unknown (Green Leaf Films Pty) Ltd)  Best Student Film Fowl Goblin from The Animation School  TV SOAP/TELENOVELA  Best Achievement in Directing –
