DUDU Myeni has admitted to facilitating meetings between former president Jacob Zuma and former Eskom board chairman, Zola Tsotsi. The former SAA board chairwoman told the commission that she did this at the behest of Tsotsi. She said she was called by Jabu Maswanganyi, who told her Tsotsi wanted her help. “I agreed because I wanted to help a colleague. I was the second person he had gone to and I said here is a colleague from another SOE I can help,” she said. She said when they met, Tsotsi asked her to organise a meeting with Zuma. The first meeting was at the president’s residential home in Joburg on 6 March 2015 and the second on 8 March in Durban. Following these meetings, three top executives – CEO Tshediso Matona, head of capital projects Dan Marokane and head of technology and commercial Matshela Koko – were suspended. Myeni said Tsotsi was not honest when he testified, alleging that Zuma wanted certain Eskom executives. She said she was falsely accused of being involved in corruption. “Whenever people speak of my name, they label me as a criminal.” She said she was being persecuted because she is close to Zuma. Myeni gave evidence in the afternoon after she failed to appear in the morning. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo then instructed the secretary to lay a criminal complaint against her.
