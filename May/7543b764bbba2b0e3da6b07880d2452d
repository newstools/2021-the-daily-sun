 Friends and family members gathered at Nyanga Art Centre to celebrate his life. Zolani was killed by his best friend last week. The friend was also a choirmaster of a group that Zolani had started. The late singer was described as someone who wanted to bring change and make people see their community differently. Speaking at the memorial, the founder of Nyanga Arts Centre, Nosisa Nama said they decided to host the memorial service there because Zolani had been actively involved with the center since he was young. "This was a sentimental venue for Zolani. Just a few weeks ago he was in rehearsals here with their choir as they were preparing to sing at the Lonwabo Jack's memorial service. Lonwabo was a young gay man who was murdered recently," she said. Nama said she thought people were bluffing when they told her about Zolani's death. "Zolani was already putting our community on the map as he was dedicated to bringing change and doing good for everyone," she explained. Zolani was an art teacher at Linge Primary School. Family member Mzamo Diba said they lost someone who loved life. "He was full of life and had big plans for his family. Zolani had promised to buy his mother a big house and a car but unfortunately, all those things will not happen," he said. Mzamo said Zolani used to ask for advice from him and was on a right track with life. Fellow choir member Thimna Baartman said the choir will never be the same without Zolani. "It still feels like a bad dream. Zolani was the reason I joined the choir because I understood his vision and how invested he was in wanting to change the youth of Nyanga," said Baartman. Other mourners said Zolani started the choir because he wanted to empower the youth and bring awareness against drugs. They said he wanted to make sure that they had something to do. Zolani will be laid to rest on Saturday.
