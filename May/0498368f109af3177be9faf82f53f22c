EMBATTLED TV pastor Stephen Zondo has promised to cooperate with the courts. In a statement through his lawyer, Zondo said: “I respect the rule of law and will subject myself to it until the matter has reached its logical conclusion.” This after the popular pastor briefly appeared in the Sebokeng Magistrates Court on Friday, 28 May, for charges of rape, defeating the ends of justice and indecent assault. Some incidents allegedly happened 41 years ago in 1980 when Zondo was 14 years old, and his victim was about eight or nine at the time. Other victims are adults who were allegedly raped at his Rivers of Living Waters Ministries in Evaton, Emfuleni. Some rape incidents happened at Hotel Formula 1 in Joburg. Following the decision to move his case to 23 August until 17 September, Zondo said he would subject himself to the courts until the end. This was after prosecutor Sammy Setlelele said investigations were finalised and the matter was ready for trial. The court was packed by congregants of his church in support of their spiritual father. They prayed in tongues outside the court, with many carrying “hands off Archbishop Zondo” placards and banners. Some pastors came out in numbers, dressed in church attire, and congregants painted the courtyard red and blue. Hymns, chanting and whistling were the order of the day as members of public order policing closely monitored the crowd. The case was transferred for trial to the Pretoria High Court. When the court was adjourned, congregants went into a frenzy ululating, some hooting and others touching Zondo’s hand as he waved from his SUV vehicle.
