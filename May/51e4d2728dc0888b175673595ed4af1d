THE Zondo Commission was forced to postpone the evidence of Armscor CEO Kevin Wakeford because of logistical problems on Wednesday, 5 May. Wakeford was scheduled to apply to cross-examine former Bosasa COO Angel Agrizzi, who implicated him at the inquiry. Evidence leader Viwe Notshe SC asked for the matter to be postponed because Wakeford received affidavits of other implicated parties late. He said this meant his testimony was not ready because he could not finalise his affidavit in order to testify. Wakeford’s lawyer, Advocate Reg Willis, said logistical issues created problems that they only received information this morning. He said his client was ready to give evidence and was on standby, but it was for the benefit of the commission and chairman of the commission Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to have his affidavit. Willis said Wakeford was one of the people who were unfortunate not to get Rule 33 notice before they were implicated by witnesses at the commission. “He has been prejudiced from the onset. We are now 28 months down the line. He is one of those who has not had his say in the media,” said Willis. Agrizzi alleged that the Port Elizabeth businessman allegedly received R100 000 a month for helping Gavin Watson’s company, Bosasa, “resolve its SARS issues”. “At one stage, Bosasa was encountering constant audits by the SARS”, Agrizzi said in the affidavit. He also claimed that on various occasions, Wakeford would offer advice with regard to how Bosasa should respond to media attacks. Zondo reluctantly granted the postponement until Thursday morning. “Of course as everybody would know, I’m very concerned about the need for the commission to use all its available time because there are time constraints but I understand the logistical challenges that I have been told about,” he said.
