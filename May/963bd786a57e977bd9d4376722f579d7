  A WOMAN was
left shocked after her ex-boyfriend’s baby mama, whom he cheated on her with,
contacted her to ask help with expenses for the baby. The baby
mama contacted her, asking her to pay for the child’s nappies. The woman
discovered that her ex had since moved on to yet another woman, and admitted
that she felt guilty about the situation even though she wasn’t wrong to
refuse. “So, my
ex-boyfriend cheated on me for the majority of our relationship but I could
never prove it,” the woman wrote on social media. “Finally,
one day I was able to find the girl and have a conversation with her. She felt
horrible and told me she had just found out that she was pregnant.” According
to Daily Mail, the woman congratulated her and ended the relationship with
their boyfriend so the two of them could start dating. A year
later, the single woman was living her best life with a better-paying job. The
girlfriend then messaged her on Facebook, asking her to buy nappies for the
baby as well as other needs because she had found out that her boyfriend (the
woman’s ex) was cheating and then left her for another woman. “She’s a
single mom with no job and living with her parents now, and he was supporting
all of them with his job. I told her I wasn’t comfortable helping with the baby
because she was sleeping with my boyfriend and continued, even after I caught them."
