] ROYAL AM were welcomed by their fans at Kwa Max Lifestyle at Umlazi’s V Section after finishing top of the GladAfrica Championship table following their 1-1 draw against Cape Town All Stars at Chatsworth Stadium on Sunday. Few can match club owner Shawn “MamMkhize” Mkhize's luxurious lifestyle, she booked the luxurious MaxLifestyle VIP area for her players, supporting staff and technical team for an after match party. Royal AM finished top of the Championship with 51 points, one point behind Sekhukhune United. MamMkhize bought the status of Real Kings in October last year for her son, Andile. But MamMkhize and her team cannot celebrate just yet. There is a pending legal case involving Sekhukhune and Polokwane City. The PSL informed clubs on Sunday that no club will receive the trophy and winners' medals until the matter has been resolved. Sekhukhune are fighting the league to award them the three points after Polokwane was found guilty for failing to adhere to the PSL’s five under-23 players after City beat Sekhukhune 1-0 in January. The matter went to arbitration last week which found City guilty and awarded Sekhukhune three points which would leave Sekhukhune as champions and promoted to the DStv Premiership. But that ruling was challenged by the PSL which has thrown the winner of the Championship into controversy.
