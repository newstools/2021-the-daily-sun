This year the iconic Market Theatre is celebrating its 45th anniversary by hosting two opera galas with an orchestra. The two-night gala will be held next Thursday and Saturday, 13 and 15 May. The gala, which will take place in the John Kani Market will see the orchestra playing Coloratura – a style of opera singing which explores the themes of love, betrayal and tragedy. The 43-piece Chamber Orchestra of Johannesburg will be led by stars Zandile Mzazi, Bongiwe Nakani and Given Nkosi. It will be supported by bass player Thomas Mohlamme and two TUT Vocal Art School students, Zintle Soga and Asisipho Petu. Legendary actor and the artist director of the theatre, James Ngcobo said: “As we celebrate the milestone of the 45th year of the Market Theatre, in such a difficult terrain that we have had to navigate since last year, we are committed to the idea of programming works that articulate our excitement with tackling different genres for all our spaces. We continue to bring new offerings to our audiences while maintaining the excellence of The Market Theatre,” said James. ALSO READ | IZANGOMA ZODUMO TV SHOW DIVIDED! Musician Kutlwano Masote, who will be hosting the orchestra, said she’s glad South Africans are supporting their own opera singers and she wants them to do more. “There are probably a hundred South African opera singers performing regularly at theatres in Europe and North America. South African theatres need to do more in supporting this wellspring of singers that we have been producing for decades,” he said. “As for the name of the show ‘coloratura’ is a word that is used all the time in opera, referring to a voice type and also to the intricate writing that shows off a singer’s command of technique. We just thought it would generate curiosity in the production and would set it apart,” said Kutlwano. Tickets cost R200 at Webtickets.
