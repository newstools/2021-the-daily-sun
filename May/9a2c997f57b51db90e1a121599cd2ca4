ROYAL AM have one hand on the GladAfrica Championship title.And they can smell promotion to the DStv Premiership. This after they pulled off a stunning 2-1 win over the University of Pretoria at Tuks Stadium yesterday. They were made to sweat for the win with Tuks coming extremely close to breaking the KwaZulu Natal outfit’s side’s hearts. But the determination on Royal AM’s side was too much for the Tshwane side. Oswin Appollis thought he had won the match for Tuks when he came off the bench to score the opener. The youngster, on loan from SuperSport United, ghosted into the box and pounced on a mistake by Royal AM captain Samuel Manganyi. Appollis had barely been on the pitch for a minute when he broke the deadlock with his first action in the match. Royal AM, desperate to hang on to their top spot, pushed hard and threw everything at Tuks. And their efforts were rewarded when Tshepo Liphoko drew them level with a stunning free-kick. But that was not enough for the KZN outfit who were smelling blood and looked to go for the kill. They found the all-important winner through a powerful low shot that pierced the net by Zukile Mkhize. They are now marching towards the title and a coveted spot in the land of milk and honey next season. Royal AM will hope to wrap the title up with a win over Cape Town All Stars at home on Sunday. Richards Bay, on the other hand, could not get past Jomo Cosmos as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Tsakane Stadium. This leaves the Natal Rich Boyz in fourth place behind Royal AM, Sekhukhune United and TS Sporting. Sekhukhune kept their chances alive with a 2-0 win over Polokwane City at the Makhulong Stadium.
