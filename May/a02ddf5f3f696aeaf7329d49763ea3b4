PEGGY Gasetilwe dreams of one day having her own vegetable farm. The 41-year-old from Ledig Village, outside Rustenburg in the North West, took a big risk and started her own backyard vegetable garden and it’s now become her passion. Peggy told Daily Sun she started the garden after resigning from her job at a shop last year. “The salary could not sustain me, but I only had a faint idea of what I wanted to do. “With no knowledge or experience in gardening, I developed a passion and love for it and began working on it,” she said. Peggy, who grew up in Mabule near Mahikeng, said her parents used to enjoy gardening but it was never something she saw herself getting into. “A lot of people couldn’t believe I was leaving my job to start a vegetable garden. “I got negative comments and people telling me it wouldn’t work,” she said. “But something in me said you’ll never know until you try. I told my husband about my idea and he supported me. After that, there was no turning back.” Peggy grows spinach, cabbage, onions, butternut, beetroot, tomatoes and African spinach. She said she aimed to get a bigger plot so she could extend her business and create jobs. Peggy said she was proud of what she had achieved so far, was grateful villagers were supporting her business. Her advice to people wanting to go into business was to put God first. “I had my fears and doubts but I asked God for wisdom and strength. It’s important that we put him first in everything,” she said Peggy said her goal was to one day work with local schools and businesses to supply them with vegetables.
