AT just 13 years old, Tshepo Mokgophana is one of the youngest amathwasa to graduate as a sangoma. When he graduated on Tuesday, 11 May in Greenvalley, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, his gobela, was happy. “Tshepo is my second child and had the ancestral calling from a young age,” said Constance. “He used to vomit when we fed him and mostly survived on soft porridge. He was in and out of hospital with strange sores all over his body, and doctors failed to help him.” Constance said Tshepo’s teachers also experienced his struggles. She said: “He used to be partially blind and collapsed in class. When we consulted healers the bones said he had a calling. I trained him, monitored by my senior gobelas. Tshepo, who’s in grade 7, said: “I’m happy I’m graduating. I’m a proud healer and my mum will help as my gobela. I want to study to be a veterinarian after matric.” Senior gobela Lizzy Dlamini was grateful everything went well.
