SERIAL rapist Philip Mathonsi (36) was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment by the Boschfontein Regional Court in Mpumalanga on Thursday, 6 May. The court heard how the residents, more especially women of Marlothpark near Komatipoort, lived in fear as Mathonsi reportedly robbed and raped them. These incidents were recorded between the period of 2016 and 2017. Mathonsi would normally wait until it was dark before preying on his victims. It is said that on 11 September 2016, Mathonsi broke into a house in Marloth Park where he attacked and raped a 63-year-old gogo and then fled. On 4 November 2016, he also attacked and raped another gogo aged 60. Mathonsi continued with his reign of terror when on 22 December 2016, he broke into another house in the same area where he attacked and raped another elderly woman who was also 60. Mathonsi again on 29 January 2017 attacked a 59-year-old woman who was alone at the time, but he fled the scene when security guards who were patrolling the area came to her rescue. On 20 December 2019, his luck ran dry when he was apprehended by security guards who then notified police and he was arrested. On the first rape count, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment, and 10 years for robbery. He was further sentenced to another 10 years for the third rape and five years for robbery. Mathonsi was meted with an additional 10 years for housebreaking as well as two years imprisonment for attempted rape. The court has ordered that count one and two run concurrently, while count three and four will also run concurrently. The court further ordered that count five run concurrently with count six and seven. Mathonsi will spend an effective 30 years behind bars. The accusedâ€™s particulars will also be entered into the National Register for Sex Offenders. Major General Thulani Phahla, the acting provincial police commissioner, welcomed the sentence.
