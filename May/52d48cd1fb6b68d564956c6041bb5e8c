EVERY evening, gogo Hellen Maponya would sit down to watch Skeem Saam on SABC1. But on 9 April, she got a horror show instead when her TV went up in flames! The 70-year-old from Mamelodi East extension 18 in Tshwane said she went to the nearest shop to buy milk for her grandchild’s pap and when she returned, found her five-roomed shack on fire. Hellen said the fire, which also destroyed her neighbour’s three-roomed shack, ate her TV, two fridges, new beds, documents and R600 of her grant money. The gogo, who lives with her two kids and two grandkids, said: “It’s been over a month and I’m still in shock. I don’t know what caused the fire but I don’t think someone would have started it, as everyone loves me in this area.” Hellen appealed for help to rebuild her shack and donations of food, clothes and furniture. She also needed help to apply for a new ID and said the City of Tshwane helped her family with tents, but they were very cold. Neighbour Kuranta Serepa (72) said: “My friend is going through hard times because she lost everything in the fire. She desperately needs help.” Tshwane Emergency Services deputy chief Charles Mabaso said there was no record of a shack fire in Mamelodi East on 9 April.
