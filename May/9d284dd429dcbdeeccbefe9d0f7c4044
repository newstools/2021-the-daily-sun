Uthando Nesthembu star and popular polygamist Musa Mseleku has offered Bishop Israel Makamu some words of comfort. In a video that’s been making rounds on social media, Mseleku said: “Sime nawe singamadoda (We stand behind you as men). He said those without sin should cast the first stone. This comes after the Rea Tsotella’s reality star allegedly asked for a poke from one of his congregants back in 2017. An audio of Makamu and the girl speaking on the phone has been trending and people have been bashing him for his behaviour. Mseleku said this shouldn’t be a big deal and he fully stands behind Makamu. “I once suggested that since I’m a bishop of polygamy, we should all come together as bishops and discuss the issues around polygamy. I don’t understand why this is such a big deal,” said Mseleku. ALSO READ: UZALO’S FIKILE ‘BEGS’ TO STAY! He also called on all pastors to come to him and discuss the issue of is’thembu. “So long as your wife and church is good, then you’re okay,” said Mseleku. People have been voicing their opinions and they’re not pleased with Mseleku. “It is his stupidity and hypocrisy for us, the public. We claim to be against women and children abuse but when a church leader abuses the girls in his church, we support him,” Nqobzin tweeted. Ozalwau Mnguni said maybe Mseleku doesn’t understand the seriousness of the situation. “I think a very big point is missed here. Makamus transgression is wanting to sleep with not just a woman, but a child. She was 17 at the time. You could even hear it in her voice, she’s a baby. Someone’s baby! They even referred to each other as father and daughter! No man!” said Ozalwau. “Distasteful attempt to trivialise this and make it a joke. Makamu is not berated for soliciting sex from his equal but from a junior that he had power over. I don’t get how this is not clear,” Tumishi tweeted.
