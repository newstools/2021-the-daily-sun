AL AHLY coach Pitso Mosimane says he is not here in South Africa with his side to prove that they can play better than Mamelodi Sundowns. Nevertheless, they are here with the hope and the belief of reaching the semifinal semifinals of the Caf Champions League. The two sides face each other in a blockbuster billed for Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday afternoon (3pm). This is Mosimane's first time in South Africa to play Downs since leaving the club eight months ago. He is heading to the second leg encounter with a positive 2-0 lead which they registered in Cairo last Saturday. "What is important is to try and get the team to the semifinals not to outplay or outclass, no I am not in that position. I have matured, I have been in this game for long, I am not here to prove a point that we can play better than Sundowns," fired up Mosimane said during the virtual press conference on Friday afternoon. Sundowns will be hoping to do better than last season, where they failed to overturn a 2-0 deficit against the same opponents in the same stage of the competition. Last season Downs lost 2-0 away to Ahly and played to a 1-1 draw in the return leg, and they were eliminated from the tournament as they lost 3-1 on aggregate. Mosimane said the hoping to repeat last seasons displays that Ahly produced when the Kagiso-born mentor was still coaching Sundowns. He said: "The 2-0 lead is a slight advantage‚ but it doesn't mean that much because I have been around in this place‚ I know the capabilities of Mamelodi Sundowns‚ that they are a strong team. "For me the approach is to copy what Ahly did last year when we (Sundowns) played Ahly. I think you all know what happened here. So I would appreciate to copy that, try and score that important goal."
