The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD)
hailed an off-duty officer, who rescued a kidnapped e-hailing driver from the
boot of his hijacked car. JMPD spokesperson Xolani Fihla said the officer received
information on Friday that a car belonging to an e-hailing service driver was
being stripped in Mid-Ennerdale. The driver had been bundled into the boot. "Upon investigation, the officer spotted a suspicious
vehicle, with two suspects as per the lookout. The officer immediately called
for backup, and the suspects noticed him from a distance. The suspects then
abandoned the vehicle and walked towards a nearby tavern," said Fihla. The officer followed the men on foot. They opened fire, and
the officer retaliated. The men are said to have fled across an open field, after
which they hid in a residential area. Officers, who arrived on the scene, freed the man from the
boot. He was taken toÂ  Ennerdale SAPS to
open a case of hijacking and kidnapping. "It was discovered the vehicle was hijacked at Ghandi
Square in the Johannesburg CBD," said Fihla. "The JPMD management commended the officer for his
courage. He has shown sheer determination, considering that he was off
duty," he said. SOURCE: NEWS24
