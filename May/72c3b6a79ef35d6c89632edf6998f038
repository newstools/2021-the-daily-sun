A PAROLEE who was released after serving 10 years of his 25-year jail term has been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a child. Vusumzi Luvatsha (42) was out on parole for four years before he raped the child. On Wednesday, he was sentenced in the Mthatha Sexual Offences Court. Said National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Luxolo Tyali: “Sometime before July 2019, Luvatsha frequently accompanied his friend, who was in a romantic relationship with the mother of the child, to the victim’s home.” Tyali said on 22 July 2019, Luvatsha met the young girl on her way to a nearby shop. “As he was known to the victim, he lured her to a secluded open field in the neighbourhood. He then raped the girl and threatened to kill her,” said Tyali. “When the victim arrived home, she informed her mother about the incident and Luvatsha was arrested,” he added. He abandoned his bail application because it emerged that he was out on parole for rape. He had served 10 years of that sentence before being released in 2015. Luvatsha had pleaded not guilty, and prosecutor Kaunda Zongo led the evidence of the victim and her mother. Zongo also presented a medical report from the NPA sexual offences and community affairs unit’s Sinawe Thuthuzela Care Centre to secure conviction. The prosecutor submitted the victim impact statement, prepared by court preparation officer Zanele Qunta. “The statement revealed that after the rape, the victim did not want to be alone and even refused to walk to school on her own. This was even though the school was only 100m from home,” said Tyali. The court agreed with prosecution that there were no compelling circumstances to justify a deviation from the prescribed minimum sentence of life imprisonment for raping a minor. It further ordered that Luvatsha’s name be entered in the register of sexual offenders.
