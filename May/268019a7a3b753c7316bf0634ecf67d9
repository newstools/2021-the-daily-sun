WHO will finish a 50km marathon in 2 hours 43 minutes 38 seconds? It sounds a bit out of the ordinary and cannot be done by any human being. But Thompson Magawana 33-year 50km record, pasted on 12 April 1988, will come under extreme threat as ultra runners gun for it. On Sunday, a quality field of men and women runners will converge in Gqeberha in an attempt to rewrite history books during the Nedbank Runified: Breaking Barriers – a 50km world record. Nedbank Athletic Club’s national manager, Nick Bester, didn’t mince his words when he said the record will fall. “Majority of the marathoners have the quality to do it. Most of their record times in a 42,2km can show that they can put in an extra energy to win it. It will interesting to see who will come closer, or break it.” This will be second time that runners are back in the streets after the SA Championships, at the same Windy City. Most runners spent the whole of yesterday finalising preparations for the race with the aim of breaking barriers. Among them are 2014, 2017, 2018 Comrades Marathon champion Bongmusa Mthembu, Ethiopian Ketema Negasa, Shadrack Kiptoo Kimaiyo from Kenya and Comrades great Edward Mothibi. The women’s race is equally well represented by Gerda Steyn, Irvette Van Zyl and Zeyituna Mude of Ethiopia.
