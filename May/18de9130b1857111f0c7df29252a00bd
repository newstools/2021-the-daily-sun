MOOPI Mothibeli, who played Smanga on Generations: The Legacy, says people want him back on the SABC1 soapie. Speaking to Daily Sun, Moopi said if he was given another opportunity to return to the show, he’d grab it with both hands. He said he was focusing on personal development as he had no acting role at the moment. He said he worked last year on the film Hotele Lerallaneng, which will premiere at the International Film Festival in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in early June.

It was quite a roller coaster,” he said. “It was a learning curve and it was challenging but a lot of fun.” He said it was his first film and he’d been working towards it for a long time. Moopi said it was challenging as his background was in TV. “I play Jabu Modise, a father and writer who’s a recovering drug and alcohol abuser. His marriage is on the brink of collapse and he’s trying to sort it out and be a father to his children. “He’s been a stranger to his children because of his addiction. He’s also writing novels to make a living, but his personal issues affect that.”
