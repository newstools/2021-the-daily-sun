SEKHUKHUNE United coach McDonald Makhubedu and his bosses remain calm ahead of the final weekend in the GladAfrica Championship. In their first season in the Championship, Sekhukhune moved to the number one spot on the log after receiving three points following the verdict of their PSL disciplinary committee case with Polokwane City FC, which was heard yesterday. Babina Noko had challenged the PSL DC’s ruling to deduct points from City for not having the required number of five Under-23 players on their team sheet but not awarding the points to them. Sekhukhune protested before the game, which they lost 1-0 on 2 January, that the points should not just be removed instead they should be awarded to them. After winning their case, the three extra points now put them top with 50 points after 29 matches, the same as Royal Am but Sekhukhune have a better goal difference. Makhubedu told SunSport they are happy with the ruling and are not going to put themselves under unnecessary pressure heading to the last game of the season. Sekhukhune visit play-offs hopefuls JDR Stars at Giant Stadium in Soshanguve on Sunday (3pm). Royal Am host Cape Town All Stars at Chatsworth Stadium at the same time. However, if both Royal AM and Sekhukhune win, Babina Noko will be promoted. Makhubedu said: “I think as a new team, we have overachieved. I remember the target was to keep the club in the league this season, but now we found ourselves in the top two. “We remain calm and focused now and if we win automatic promotion on Sunday that would be a bonus for us.”
