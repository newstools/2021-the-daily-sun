FORMER Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter and his assistant Molefi Ntseki have been tipped to replace Gavin Hunt as Kaizer Chiefs coaches. The embattled Hunt was given his marching orders by Amakhosi on Friday in a shocking move just two matches before the end of what has been a difficult campaign for the Soweto giants. READ: BREAKING: CHIEFS FIRE HUNT! Hunt has struggled in Naturena with Amakhosi currently languishing in 11th spot on the DStv Premiership table. He has, however, led the club to their best showing in continental football where they reached the semi-finals of the Caf Champions League. That doesn’t seem to be enough for the ambitious Amakhosi who have decided to part ways with the former Bidvest Wits mentor. And the club is said to be turning to former coach Stuart Baxter in an attempt to lure him back to a position he quit in 2015 after leading them to a second league and cup double in the space of three seasons. According to reports, Baxter is leading in the race to replace Hunt and he would be assisted by his former Bafana assistant Ntseki should he sign on the dotted line. Baxter is said to be a big fan of Ntseki with whom he worked at Bafana before he handed the reins over to him. Ntseki was dismissed as Bafana coach on March 31 this year after he failed to qualify the team to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). Meanwhile, Baxter has been out of a job since he was sacked from his coaching gig in India with Odisha FC earlier this year after he made some distasteful comments after a match. Amakhosi are in a race against time to appoint Hunt’s successor as the club have a crucial Caf Champions League semi-final tie against Moroccan giants Wydad Casablanca next month. Assistant coaches Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard have been tasked with taking charge of the team in the remaining two league matches – against Golden Arrows at FNB Stadium on Wednesday and against TS Galaxy at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday.
