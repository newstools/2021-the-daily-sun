FORMER North West deputy police commissioner Major-General William Mpembe could still be cleared of all charges against him relating to the 2012 Marikana killings. Mpembe appeared in the North West High Court on five charges relating to the deaths of two police officers and three civilians yesterday. On 29 March, he left the same court after being cleared of all charges relating to the deaths of striking miners. Mpembe and three other top cops were acquitted on a charge of obstructing the course of justice. ALSO READ:NEC: BRA ACE MUST APOLOGISE! They were accused of hiding information about the death of miner Modisaotsile Sagalala, who died in police custody during the strike. Mpembe was on the stand with five other top cops. They were charged with five counts of murder, attempted murder, defeating the ends of justice and violating the Commissions Act by giving false information at the Farlam Commission. This was in connection with five murders in Marikana on 13 August 2012 during a wage strike by Lonmin mineworkers. Several key witnesses testified when the matter appeared in the high court on 12 October last year. Among those were a crime scene expert from the SAPS, a CCTV operator from Lonmin Mines and a videographer from the SAPS. The new trial was rolled over to today to allow the court to find a Pedi speaking court interpreter. More key witnesses are expected to give evidence.
