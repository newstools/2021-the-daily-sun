Juventus striker Paulo Dybala just bought himself an expensive Lamborghini Aventador. The soccer star was celebrating his 100th goal for the legendary Italian team after his 251st appearance for it. The Lamborghini dealership had quite a few cars on offer, but the Argentinian player opted for the Aventador S Roadster. The supercar is capable of hitting 100km/h in just 3 seconds thanks to its 544kW naturally aspirated V12 engine. “With the Aventador, it was love at first sight,” said Dybala. He told Carscoops he waited a few years before buying it, but now it’s very humbling. He said it’s an honour and a privilege to be able to own one. The soccer star opted to get the car with a black interior with yellow stitching to match the Giallo Orion exterior.
