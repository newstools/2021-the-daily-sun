TRAFFIC cops bust a taxi driver for attempted murder and reckless driving after he ran over a cop in Philippi, Browns Farm, on Monday. MMC for safety and security JP Smith said: “This morning, just after 7am, traffic officers stopped a minibus driver in Browns Farm for reckless driving and causing a danger to other road users. “The driver refused to open the doors and proceeded to drive away, knocking one of the officers to the ground. “During the ensuing chase, the driver tried several times to ram the patrol vehicle off the road, and blatantly endangered the officers, his passengers as well as other road users. “In an attempt to stop the vehicle, the officers fired a few shots at the wheels of the minibus.” ALSO READ: SPEEDSTER (16) CLOCKS 200KM/H! Resident Yonela Mpeshe (46), who witnessed the incident, told the SunTeam it was like watching a movie. “The way he was ramming into the traffic cops’ car was similar to what we see in movies. My fear was that he was going to overturn and cause the deaths of some commuters who were screaming inside,” said Mpeshe. He drove towards the taxi rank in Browns Farm, where he abandoned the taxi and fled the scene on foot. “The officers secured the scene and the taxi was impounded. The taxi owner later brought the driver to the traffic department. He was subsequently placed under arrest on charges of attempted murder and reckless and negligent driving,” said Smith.
