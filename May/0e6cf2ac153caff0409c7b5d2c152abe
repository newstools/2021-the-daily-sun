AFTER Miss South Africa Organisation announced that transgender women can contest for the beauty pageant again this year, gays and Lesbians community were over the moon. Transgender women said it is their time to shine. The award-winning and Becoming reality show star Yaya Mavundla said this is a very important and exciting thing for Miss SA to do. She said at one stage, she wanted to become a Miss SA but she accepted that, at that time, it was not possible. “Having been a fan of the pageant over the years and attending many of their events, it makes me happy to see the inclusion of other transgenders who especially want to participate on that stage. Last year I had a conversation with one of their team members about this and they showed interest and it excites me to see this happen,” said Yaya. ALSO READ: MISS SA OPEN TO TRANSGENDER WOMEN! Gay actor Khaya Dladla said she was happy for transgender women. “I meet a lot of transgender women and when they talk you realise this person is a woman but in a man’s body. “They should be given the same opportunity like every woman in this country. It was heartbreaking for them that there were no big pageants that included them like Miss SA. I think it’s a great opportunity and a great chance for them. I also hope Mzansi will support this decision,” said Khaya. “Whuuuuh shame, Miss SA Organisation must prepare for a lot of entries,” said Khaya. Co-founder of the Lesbian and Gay Community Centre, Nonhlanhla Mkhize, said that it is now time for everyone to learn more about the transgender community. “I believe the Miss SA Organisation’s decision will educate people about the transgender community to reduce the hate. We are happy about it and fully support it,” said Mkhize. Entries for this year’s Miss SA were opened on 24 May and will be closing on 24 June.
