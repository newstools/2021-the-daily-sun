I can tell you now that whatever argument Msholozi’s legal team will be presenting at his trial in the Pietermaritzburg High Court for prosecutor Billy Downer to recuse himself will eventually fail. Surely, if Jacob Zuma had evidence of nothing short of misconduct on the lead prosecutor’s part, he’d have gleefully handed it over to the court already! I can bet my last cent that even when his application fails, Zuma will come up with another fictitious misconduct claim on the part of the judiciary, just to delay the inevitable. Already, the resignation of his previous legal team raised eyebrows. I do believe that the intention was to delay his trial. Yes, Zuma is the undisputed champion of delaying tactics. As former ANC MP, executive director of Corruption Watch UK and arms industry expert Andrew Feinstien has said, the arms deal was the “point at which the ANC lost its moral compass”. 
 We need to know the truth, and we need to know exactly who else was responsible for opening the door to graft in South Africa. 
 Zuma is, hopefully, just the beginning. This letter wins our R200 prize today. Call Cheryl at our offices to collect. – Deputy Editor
