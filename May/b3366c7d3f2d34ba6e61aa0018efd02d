Experts say the third Covid-19 wave could strike by next month, but it seems many people don’t care. We are certainly not ready to prevent the new wave from killing more people as the nation is divided on who should follow Covid-19 rules, and who shouldn’t. The shops are still following the Covid-19 protocols by making customers sanitise and wear masks. Churches that have large memberships have still not opened. Sports supporters are still prohibited from going to the stadiums. Passengers still wear masks in public transport. With the above-mentioned being good preventative measures against Covid-19, it’s unfortunate that the same can’t be said about the taverns. The boozers are only made to wear the masks and sanitise their hands only to gain entry into the shebeens. Once they’re inside, they take off their masks and drink alcohol in their large numbers. The authorities must wake up and tighten the lockdown again for the month of June. - Letter by Ephenia Kubu, Ga-Rankuwa View
