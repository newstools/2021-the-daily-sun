A man from North West allegedly stabbed his childhood lover multiple times because he apparently couldn’t accept their break-up. The man who’s a court official at the Wolmaransstad Magistrate Court is also alleged to have gone on to stab a neighbour where his girlfriend had run to for cover. The body of Lindiwe Tladi (24) was left in a pool of blood after the man allegedly stabbed her face and stomach several times. Her sister Nono Tladi said the couple were high school lovers. They met when Lindiwe was doing grade 9 and the man was in grade 11. “We don’t know what could have led him to do such a horrible thing. He once told us he had plans to marry her. They were in a seven-year relationship,” she said. She said on Wednesday, 11 May, the man arrived at Lindiwe’s parental place and called off the relationship. He apparently accused her of cheating on him. “The following day in the morning he came and apologised for his behaviour. He told Lindiwe he wanted her back, but Lindiwe refused to take him back.” The Tladi family said later on Thursday, 13 May, the man arrived at their home but Lindiwe wasn’t home as she’d gone to pick her son up from pre-school. “When she arrived, he didn’t waste time. He grabbed her with her clothes and started beating her up,” she said. She said while they were trying to stop the fight, the man took out a knife out from behind his back and allegedly stabbed Lindiwe twice with it. “We begged him to stop but he threatened to stab us as well. Lindiwe got a chance to run to a neighbour’s house but he followed her,” she said. Lindiwe’s brother Thabiso Tladi said when he arrived, a neighbour was trying to intervene but the man allegedly stabbed the neighbour and “finished Lindiwe off”. The man then ran to his parental home and that was where the police arrested him. North West police spokeswoman, Captain Aafje Botma confirmed the incident. “A 25-year-old man was arrested and police are investigating a murder case,” she said.
