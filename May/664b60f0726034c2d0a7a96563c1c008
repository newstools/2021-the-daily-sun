THE Kweyama family who laid to rest the wrong man in their home got to bury their loved one on Saturday, 22 May. The family from Umbumbulu in the Umgugu area, south of Durban, had buried a man whom they thought was their brother in March only to be told a month later they had buried the wrong body. Their brother Sibongiseni Kweyama (46) was admitted at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital on 5 March, the same day as a man by the name of Vusumuzi Ncanana (42).  Their beds were next to each other and they both were suffering from similar breathing complications. On 12 March, Sibongiseni’s family got a call informing them he had died and on 20 March the body was buried. But on 16 April they got a call from the hospital informing them the person they had buried was not Sibongiseni. His sisters Nomusa Mkhize (62) and Thandeka Kweyama (33) said this has affected them emotionally and financially. “We went to hospital and were told Sibongiseni and Vusumuzi’s files got mixed up on the first day they were admitted. Apparently the files got mixed up when they were changing beds. They both couldn’t speak. “We were told even the medication they each took was wrong,” said Nomusa.  She said on Tuesday Vusumuzi’s body was dug up from their home and then on Friday, 21 May, the family went to fetch Sibongiseni to finally bury him today. “We are glad this has been resolved. However, it means we’ve had to have two funerals,” she said. She said they had claimed the money from their policies and now they didn’t have money. “As we spent all our money in the first funeral and gave a man we don’t know a dignified funeral, now we couldn’t do that for our brother. We couldn’t even do our rituals as we had no money for that,” said Thandeka.
