A DRIVING school instructor has left Mzansi in stitches. Some laughed while criticising the instructor, but others felt sad for the woman who was learning how to drive. In the video that has since gone viral, the woman arrives late for her driving lesson. When she gets into the car, she’s immediately instructed on what to do while at the same time the instructor keeps reminding her that she’s late, clearly thinking that his job is less important. He questions what she might be teaching kids in school when she can’t follow instructions. The instructor even tells her to remove her mask and keeps hitting her face with the papers that he makes her sign. Some feel sad for the learner as it appears she couldn’t focus anymore, with fear visible in her eyes. Nqobile Mnguni said she didn’t understand why the instructor was rude. “The lady explained she was late because the principal had extra work for them,” said Nqobile. “So why does he keep doing this to her? This is really annoying and bullying on another level. “He needs to deal with his anger issues because that driving school won’t go anywhere if he’s treating people like this.” Musawakhe Nkosi said: “He’s misusing his power. I hope he gets people his age. Usile!” Adrian Mthethwa said the video is funny, but she didn’t understand why the woman just took in everything the instructor was doing to her. “I’m pretty sure she’s paying for those lessons and I don’t understand why she’s quiet. I hope it’s a joke. Even though it’s hard to watch I laughed. I’m sorry.”
