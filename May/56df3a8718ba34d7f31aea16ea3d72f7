Mathematical equations often say what one does on the left, the same must be replicated on the right. This powerful mathematical rule has also become an analogy of life. Whether we’re talking about gender-equality or human equality in general, we always look at the left and want to replicate it to our right. We use the same analogy in measuring cheating in relationships. As one relationship expert puts it: “Cheating is cheating, no matter who does it in a relationship”. However, while stats reveal that men cheat more than woman. According to Brides.com publication, these are some of the popular reasons why women cheat in relationships: 1. Dissatisfaction in their Relationship People justify this by saying: “We are in a bad patch”. An opportunity may arise for one person to cheat. And instead of stopping things before they start, they justify crossing the boundary because their relationship’s going through a tough time. 2. Low Self-Esteem When a woman is struggling with low self-worth, it may spur them to look to external sources for the attention and validation their partner’s unable to create and sustain. 3. Emotional Starvation While studies suggest that men who cheat are primarily motivated by sex, women who cheat tend to do so to fill an emotional need. 4. Anger or Retribution Some women enter into a relationship with an idealised image of how their spouse should behave. When the partner falls short of expectations and can’t meet their every need and desire, it can create a divide in the relationship that provides the urge to stray.
