TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) midfielder, Joseph Molangoane, has warned his teammates not to underestimate his former team Kaizer Chiefs when the two sides clash in a DStv Premiership showdown at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesda (5pm). Amakhosi have been inconsistent this season. The Soweto giants have failed to win their previous two league matches. TTM are second bottom with 22 points from 24 league games. Gavin Hunt’s charges are ninth on the log with 29 points from 25 league matches, and their form has been poor this season. Chiefs have lost the feat factor they carried with many teams not scared of them anymore. But warned the 33-year-old Molangoane, who spent four years with the Soweto giants: “Chiefs are a big team and we should not read too much about their recent form as that would be a huge mistake. “We are expecting a tough game, but we will be ready for them (Chiefs). “We are fighting to move from the danger zone while they are fighting to end the season in the top eight. All we have to do is to stick to our game and make sure we give our best. “This is a very important game for us to start collecting points.” The Venda-based side come into this clash following a 2-1 defeat against their rivals Back Leopards over the weekend. The last time these two sides clashed, Chiefs won 3-0 with goals from Lebogang Manyama, Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Happy Mashiane. But the Moletjie-born star is optimistic of upsetting Chiefs. “We are playing at home and we should use that to our advantage,” added Molangoane. “We lost to them in the first round but things are different now. We need to get back to winning ways to move away from the position we’re in.”
