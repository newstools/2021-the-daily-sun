The exodus by non-white DA leaders from the party is far from over. People will recall that three years ago I warned my fellow brothers and sisters in the DA they’re absolutely NOT welcome in that political party. I also recall saying only their votes are needed. I even reminded everyone the DA was formed mainly by anti-black Nats and conservatives. My prediction was spot on. Where are Herman Mashaba, Mmusi Maimane and Phumzile van Damme to day? The list is endless. Now that the pillars are gone, the rest of the crew will automatically fall off or vanish into thin air because there’s no one to represent them. Even if they resist they’ll be frustrated until the DA becomes 100% white. And again, fellas, don’t frustrate yourself even more by going to the Mickey mouse political parties recently formed out of anger. - Letter by Jabulani Mazibuko, Kriel
