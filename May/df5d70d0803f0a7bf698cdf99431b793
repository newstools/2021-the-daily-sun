Nyanga police in Cape Town are investigating a murder case after a 35-year-old taxi owner was shot and killed last night, 13 May, outside his home in Nyanga. A family member said it was around 9.30pm when three people walked past their house. “At first we didn’t give attention to them but after they did this three times we asked ourselves what they are looking for,” said the family member. She said the taxi owner, Thandekile Mtyiwazo, wasn’t home at the time. “It was clear they were hiding somewhere close because they shot him while he was opening the gate to get inside,” said the family member. She said he was shot more than 10 times. “We are living in fear because we don’t know if they are going to come back or not,” she said. They described Thandekile as someone who loved everyone. “He loved everyone, especially kids. He had a soccer team and when the incident happened, he was coming from the gym,” said the family member. A resident said whoever shot Thandekile made sure they killed him. “It was like a movie. The way they shot him shows that they were given a strict message that they must kill him,” said the resident. He said they’ll miss him. “He never bragged about his taxis. Instead, he was always helping where he can,” he said. Captain FC Van Wyk said circumstances surrounding the incident where the 35-year-old was shot and fatally wounded are under investigation. “A murder case was opened for investigation,” said Van Wyk He said according to reports, the victim opened the gates at his premises.
