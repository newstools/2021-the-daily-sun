LATE legendary photographer Sam Nzima’s old home has been turned into a mini museum to honour his work. The Sam Nzima Foundation unveiled the museum in Lillydale near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga on Saturday, 22 May. The event was attended by community members, Councillor Rabie Mhlaba, Nzima’s wife and seven of her children, foundation coordinator Babalwa Hopa and Ubumbano Lwamangwe, a member of Nzima’s clan, and uThukela Mayor Siphiwe Mazibuko. On Friday, the foundation launched the Sam Nzima Memorial Lecture at Constitution Hill in Joburg, in partnership with the arts, culture and tourism departments, Nestle and the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism. Nzima, who took the globally iconic picture of a dying Hector Pieterson during the Soweto Uprising in 1976, died in 2018 at the age of 84. Speaking at the museum launch, Nzima’s eldest son and foundation chairman Thulani said: “We appreciate the support that we’re getting from both the community and our media partners, especially Daily Sun, which has always been with us since his departure from earth. “We want to encourage people to support his legacy project. It’s much more than a Nzima family project. It belongs to the community, Mpumalanga and the nation. “We’ve also set the memorial lecture in motion. “Every year the lecture will create a space for people to create dialogue and discuss various subjects.” Mazibuko said he was honoured to be able to celebrate Nzima’s legacy.
