NEGOTIATIONS are at an advanced stage between Kaizer Chiefs and Stuart Baxter for the latter to take over the coaching reins. SunSport understands that the struggling Amakhosi are looking to appoint Baxter as soon as this week after they sacked Gavin Hunt on Friday. Baxter is expected to be appointed, along with assistant Molefi Ntseki, to a position he successfully held between 2012 and 2015. Ntseki is understood to have agreed in principle to join Amakhosi and will put pen to paper on Monday. The Scot is currently unattached after he parted ways with Indian side Oshia under controversial circumstances last June.
