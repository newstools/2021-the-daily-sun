SHE lives a different life compared to many women around the world. This Ugandan woman who has never cut down her hair is married to seven husbands, and can allegedly also raise people from the dead. In an interview with Afrimax, she narrated how she was made to marry some residents the elders of her spirituality chose for her, in a bid to produce many children, which was allegedly a source of her power. She said she used powers from the dead to treat suffering people. “Elders often bring me visions. They do this after learning of someone’s behaviour and after having this vision, I go out and look for that person,” the woman said. She said most of the people she dreamt about lived far from the area. “Due to my spiritual powers, no one can reject me when I ask them to marry me,” she added.
