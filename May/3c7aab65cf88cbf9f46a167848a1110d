To avoid going to prison, a former Buffalo City ANC leader allegedly threw boiling water at police officers in an attempt to evade arrest. Zolani Xego, a former branch chairperson for the ANC in the Buffalo City Metro, locked himself in the house and allegedly threw boiling water at the officers who came to arrest him on Friday morning, according to Eastern Cape National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Anelisa Ngcakani. Xego was notified to report to the clerk of the court at the East London Magistrate's Court by 10 May to begin serving an eight-year prison sentence. But he did not do so. So, a warrant of his arrest was issued, Ngcakani said. In January 2015, Xego was sentenced by the court to 15 years' imprisonment for faking his own death to claim a R3.6 million life policy, he added. In October 2018, the Grahamstown High Court dismissed Xego's appeal to have his conviction and sentence overturned. It instead reduced his 15-year jail sentence to eight years.

"When the police arrived at his home in Southernwood, East London, around 7am, Xego refused them entry. He allegedly threw boiling water when they eventually gained entry." After he allegedly threw boiling water at them, the police retreated. He eventually handed himself over when his lawyer arrived at his home, Ngcakani said.
