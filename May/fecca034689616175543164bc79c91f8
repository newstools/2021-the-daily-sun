COMEDIAN, musician and fashion designer, Promise Sibanda, was allegedly moered by a security guard for no reason. The 34-year-old said his sin was to stand in front of King Bruce Flat in Hillbrow, Joburg on Friday, 30 April, where he lives. “I was busy talking to my friend and one security officer from Bad Boyz Security put his hand in my pocket. When I tried to ask what was wrong, he slapped me in the nose and I bled for almost 40 minutes. They put me inside a marked van,” he said.  Promise was allegedly detained at Hillbrow Police Station for three hours. He said the security guard should bring back his missing Zimbabwean passport with a valid South African permit and black Hisense E40 cell phone.
