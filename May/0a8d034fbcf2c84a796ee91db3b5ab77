GAUTENG cops have launched a manhunt after a cop was killed and another wounded in Tshwane on Monday morning, 24 May. The incident allegedly occurred at about 1am when two constables from Boschkop Police Station were on patrol. According to Brigadier Vish Naidoo, the two spotted a white VW Polo without registration plates travelling in the vicinity of the N4 Highway near the Solomon Mahlangu on-ramp. “They ordered the driver to stop and then approached the vehicle on foot. Two male suspects emerged from the car and a scuffle ensued between them and the constables,” Naidoo said in a statement. ALSO READ: DA REJECTS ‘RADICAL’ BOOZE BAN PROPOSALS!
