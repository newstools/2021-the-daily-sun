ORLANDO Pirates face a mammoth task in a bid to progress to the semi-finals of Caf Confederation Cup. Bucs will visit Moroccan side Raja Casablanca at Stade Mohamed V Stadium on Sunday (6pm), knowing well that a goalless draw will end their dream of lifting the trophy. However, Pirates have themselves to blame for allowing Raja to score a crucial away goal in their 1-1 draw in the first leg played at Orlando Stadium last weekend. The Soweto giants will need to win in Morocco if they are to progress further, something that other South African clubs have failed to achieve on their visit to the North African country. Former Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane failed to overcome Wydad Athletic on five occasions in Morocco. He managed to break his duck last season and beat Athletic 2-0 (5-1 on aggregate) in the Champions League semi-final when he took charge of Egyptian giants Al Ahly. Kaizer Chiefs lost 2-1 (3-1 on aggregate) to Raja in the Champions League second round away. But Bucs coach Josef Zinnbauer is positive they will breach the Raja defence again. This was their first time Raja conceded in seven Champions League matches. The Germanborn mentor said a 2-2 draw will be enough to secure their place in the last four of competition. Said Zinnbauer: “We won’t travel to Casablanca to lose. Maybe a draw will be enough for us.” “That is our target. We want to reach the semi-finals. Yes, they have quality players, but so are we. So it will be a big game on Sunday. We are going there for good results.” Zinnbauer said skipper Happy Jele and goalkeeper Richard Ofori have a 50-50 chance of featuring in the game after they recovered from injury. “We’ve got players back. We have Ofori, Lorch (Thembinkosi), Happy and Terence Dzvukamanja. They have a chance to play,” explained Zinnbauer. Pirates will pin their hopes on Vincent Pule to upset Raja, who will rely heavily on Ben Malango who broke the hearts of Bucs fans in the first leg at Orlando Stadium.
