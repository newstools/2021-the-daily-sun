REALITY TV star and businesswoman Shaun Mkhize is concerned about inequalities in South Africa. To address these, she has a plan. On Thursday morning, 6 May, she expressed her wishes to become president. In a video clip on her Instagram page, she invited people to vote for her so she can address these inequalities. She said: “Fellow South Africans, I woke up today and I think you guys must just vote for me for president. People don’t want that position, they come in and they go. So I just want to fix the country and I am going to tell you exactly what I’ll be doing. Well, I don’t know politics and I’m not interested in it but if you vote for me I promise you one thing. The main problem in South Africa is inequality. So I’m going to approach the Reserve Bank and ask them to give each South African a million, a car and a house. Once we are all equal then we’ll invest our money overseas. That way no one will be jealous. Please vote for me guys, MaMkhize for President.” ALSO READ: SKEEM SAAM EXTRAS: 'WE ARE BEING MISTREATED' She then captioned the clip: “Vote for stability and equality in our country to create harmony and peace.
