POPULAR event promoter Muzi Nkosi is set to host the inaugural event of his much-anticipated Speak Mjita gala dinner. The gala dinner, set to take place in June, will see actor Patrick Shai and Radio Bop presenter Hector Motau talking about topics that contribute to gender-based violence. These burning issues will be discussed over a three-course meal at the Idle Winds Conference Centre. Speaking to Daily Sun, Muzi said he has had the idea of the gala dinner for years. “Most people are looking at gender-based violence at face value. They’re not looking at the root cause of the problem, and that’s what the event is aimed at finding – the root cause of men being abusive and how we can deal with it to ensure an end of this epidemic,” he said.

They will receive some motivation from Hector. “There will also be a cooling room where men will get a chance to discuss personal issues in a private and more relaxed environment.” The well-known event promoter said this will not be a one-off thing. “This is an inaugural event. We’re hoping to have another event later on this year and the intention is that everyone who attends will go back to their own home town and start something with his group of friends. We want this to be a lifelong thing,” he said.
