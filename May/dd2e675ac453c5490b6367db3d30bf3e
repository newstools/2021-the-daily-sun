JUVENTUS star Ronaldo has continued to leverage on his international brand. He is proving to be successful as an entrepreneur off the pitch, just as he is a goal machine on the pitch. The latest in his high range of fashion items is the CR7 Junior eyewear collection which he has been promoting with his son, Ronaldo Jr.  “Come back with your new collection of sunglasses, how to choose the perfect pair? It’s that simple: the new glasses collection CR7 is the answer,” says the former Manchester United goal-machine to his millions of fans on his social network Instagram. “Creativity, speed of execution and a look to the future are our ingredients. A recipe that has led us to become a reality capable of attracting recognized brands worldwide.”
