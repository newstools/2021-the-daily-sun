NEW Bafana Bafana coach Hugo Broos is expected to arrive in the country today to start his work and familiarise himself with structures. He will meet members of the Safa technical committee, including Safa CEO Tebogo Motlanthe, either tomorrow or on Wednesday with regards to getting his assistant coaches on board, according to our insider. Broos was appointed by Safa last week on a five-year deal, to replace sacked coach Molefi Ntseki after Bafana’s failure to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals in Cameroon next year. The Belgium coach’s first mandate from Safa president Danny Jordaan is a succession plan to rebuild the current ageing Bafana squad. The former Cameroon coach stressed there were a lot of players in their 30s and said he needs younger players. He said some of them may not feature in the qualifiers of the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar‚ the 2023 Afcon and the 2026 World Cup in the US‚ Mexico and Canada, as these are Broos’ proposed targets. To help Broos put the squad together, he will run look into the SA Under-23 team that will feature in this year’s Tokyo Olympic Games – to see which players he can add to his squad. Broos was given some breathing space after the 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign, initially set to start next month, was pushed back to September. “One of the things he has mentioned is that a high percentage of the current players are 30 years and older‚ and there’s a need to rebuild the team,” said Jordaan. In the squad that played two Afcon qualifiers in March against Ghana and Sudan, were a number of players who are 30 and older such as Itumeleng Khune (33), Themba Zwane (31), Ruzaigh Gamildien (32), Sifiso Hlanti (31), captain Thulani Hlatshwayo (31), Thabang Monare (31), Andile Jali (31), Ben Motshwari (30) and Veli Mothwa (30).
