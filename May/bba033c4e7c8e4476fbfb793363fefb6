SEX work is not only my job, it’s my profession and I love what I do. These were the words of a woman who has been a sex worker for over 15 years. The mum of two told Daily Sun that with the money she earned, she was able to send her kids to private school and buy a house and a car. She was among the magoshas who joined forces with the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force (Sweat), Sisonke and the Asijiki Coalition for the Funk It I’m Walking event in Hillbrow, Joburg, on Thursday 27 May. The walk was led by artist and social activist, Nomsa Mazwai. The organisations are calling for sex work to be decriminalised. They said legalising it would make magoshas less vulnerable to human trafficking and murder. The mum of two told the SunTeam she went into sex work at a young age because her family was very poor. “This job has given me financial freedom and I’m now my own boss. I don’t belong to any brothel.”  She said she advertised online and targeted customers from abroad. “Most of my clients are paying me in euros and that’s how I make a lot of money. This has allowed me to pursue my studies and I now have a diploma in business management. I will not quit sex work because it’s my passion, but the diploma is my back-up.” Zandile Mbabaza, who worked in the sex industry for over six years before joining Sweat, said sex workers were tortured by clients and abused by cops when they wanted to open criminal charges. “People think sex workers are dirty and sick because they sell sex but that is a wrong perception. These women are mothers, sisters and breadwinners. “They also have human rights and need to be protected,” she said. Activist Dudu Dlamini, who is also part of Sweat, said sex work was still illegal under laws made during apartheid. She asked: “Weed is decriminalised but why not sex work?”
