RONALDO has given a clearest indication yet that he will be leaving Italian giants Juventus at the end of the season.  The Juventus star has been caught by Italian football website, Per Semper Calcio, packing up his cars from his Turin home at 3 o'clock in the morning, as rumours swelled that he could be heading back home to his boyhood club Sporting Lisbon.  Ronaldo joined the Old Lady from Real Madrid three seasons ago, looking to help deliver the elusive Uefa Champions League trophy for the Bianconeri. ????

In those three years, Juventus could reach the final and they could actually miss out in next year’s edition, unless either AC Milan or Napoli implode on the final day of the season.  Such possible eventuality will certainly compel the five-time ballon d’or winner to move.
