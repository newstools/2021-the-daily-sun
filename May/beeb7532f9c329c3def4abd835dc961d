BOXES of cash were seen flying in the air after five gunmen blew up a G4S cash truck. They then robbed it of an undisclosed amount of cash on Thursday, 20 May. This all happened on Manyeleti road in Cottondale near Andover Nature Reserve near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. Frightened motorists and villagers had to run for dear life from flying bullets from the gang, driving in a white Ford Ranger. By the time station Commander Colonel John Ngwenya and Lieutenant Colonel Brian Mnisi from Mhala police arrived at the scene, the gang had already sped off. “We saw the cash vehicle overtaking in a high a chase with the Ford Ranger on its tail from Hluvukani towards Acornhoek. The gang of five men was shooting at it, forcing it out of the road shortly after passing the Andover Nature Reserve. But the driver of the cash truck lost control and stopped. So fast the gang surrounded it and continued shooting. The gang then pulled the two guards out and forced them to lie on the ground. They robbed them of their guns and bombed the truck before they fled the scene with the money,” said the motorists. They said after the gang bombed the vehicle with explosives, boxes of money started flying around and money was scattered on the road before the gang, joined by a red sedan, sped off. Colonel Brenda Muridili confirmed the incident and that all along, the red sedan had been parked a distance away from the scene. “No injuries were reported and no arrests were made,” said Muridili.
