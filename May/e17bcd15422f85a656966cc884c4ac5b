AS if the task of securing a top-three league finish for Orlando Pirates wasn’t tough enough, now coach Josef Zinnbauer has a dark cloud hanging over his future at the club. Still recovering from the debilitating 4-0 defeat to Raja Casablanca, Zinnbauer will be worried to learn of a planned march for his removal from the hotseat. A section of Orlando Pirates are planning to march to the club’s office in Orlando on 5 June to demand the removal of the German, according to a poster circulating on social media. Zinnbauer has come under increasing pressure as a result of his team’s inconsistent run of results. The last straw for the Ghost seems to be the humiliating Confederation Cup exit when the Buccaneers crashed out in the quarter-finals on Sunday. Zinnbauer is yet to comment on the Casablanca massacre and he is focusing on his next challenge, a tricky league clash against AmaZulu at home tomorrow. But the news of the planned march would have already filtered through, judging by the reaction of fans to the latest loss. Zinnbauer joined Bucs in December 2019 and soon gained popularity with the success-starved Bucs fans, though he only qualified for the Caf Confederation Cup with a top-three finish in his first full season. He has already delivered the MTN8 trophy, but many feel the Soweto giants could have done more to challenge Mamelodi Sundowns for league honour, given their playing personnel. Zinnbauer has questioned his players’ attitude and the latest would no doubt have left affected the waning confidence levels. But his selection has also been questioned by those who reckon no amount of injuries should derail the team with a sizable squad. Next up is AmaZulu, who have proven to be hard nuts to crack, who they host at Orlando Stadium on Thursday (7pm).
