Football is a game played by fathers and sons the world over, but few of them have had successful careers at the professional level. Former Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane, currently with the Egyptian giants' Al Ahly, became the first player to score against the Manchester United legend Gary Bailey in South Africa when Jingles was still playing for Jomo Cosmos. As a player, Mosimane played for local clubs such as Jomo Cosmos and Mamelodi Sundowns. Now his son, Reatlegile, seems to be following in his footsteps... if the video, recently posted by Al Ahly, is anything to go by. Reatlegile has been captured juggling a ball in Cairo during one of his visits. The lad looks to be taking a keen interest in football. Judging by the skill, he could well be the next "Jingles" of SA football. A post shared by Al Ahly SC (@alahlyegypt)  A post shared by Al Ahly SC (@alahlyegypt)
