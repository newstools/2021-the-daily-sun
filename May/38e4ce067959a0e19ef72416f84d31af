RADIO and TV presenter Ntombee Mzolo has opened her heart to Thalabodiba Secondary School in Ha-Sehunya Village, Free State. On Monday, 10 May, the Lekunutu presenter donated a solar powered computer lab with a fully installed 3Kw system that has Canadian solar panels and 200AH gel batteries. Ntombee said the six-metre container has computers and a printer. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “I want pupils to have access to information without the interruption of electricity. The sun is free and therefore no more load shedding for them.” Ntombee said this was her way of planting a seed in different communities. “The future of these pupils is in our hands. Let’s work together to bring change in them,” said Ntombee, who appeals for more partners to work with her. ALSO READ: ACTOR’S FINAL BOW ON UZALO! She said the idea of giving to Thalabodiba came after they spoke to His Majesty Morena Moremoholo Mopeli of the royal Bakoena ba Mopeli. “We found out it was part of his vision to uplift his community.” The project was made possible by Invest Solar led by Ellie Salkow and their BEE partner, Mshiswa Renewable Energy owned by Ntombee. His Majesty’s birthday officially opened the project. The principal, Bongani Tshabalala, said the new computer lab will bridge the gap between manual paper work and the electronic system. “We’re going to have a timetable to teach pupils basic computer literacy. “We’re ready to face the world of technology,” said Tshabalala, who has hired security guards to guard their computer lab 24/7. Matric pupil Palesa Sekonyela said she did not know how to use a computer. “The computer lab will help me a lot. I cannot wait to be computer literate. My school work will improve,” said Palesa. Another grade 12 pupil, Mookgo Mofokeng, said the computer lab will give them access to the world. “There will be no delay with our school work since we do not need electricity to use the computer facility.”
