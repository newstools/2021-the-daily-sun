Friend and musician Thebe Mogane said they had lost a compassionate, funny and loving man. “I don’t remember him arguing or fighting. In most situations he would distance himself or be the voice of reason.” After news of Mjokes’ death broke on Sunday, his wife Lydia Sikwane said she couldn’t believe her life partner was gone. “I’m in disbelief. I knew something was wrong when the police called and asked when I last saw him. They then called me to the scene where the car fell down a cliff. It has not sunk in yet that he’s gone as I can still see his face and smile.” Mjokes leaves behind Lydia and their three children.
