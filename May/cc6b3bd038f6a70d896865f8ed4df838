Outspoken Baroka Diski Challenge Rewired new coach, Kgoloko Thobejane, says his goal is to produce the best players for Bakgakga that will be promoted to DStv Premiership. Thobejane returned to football after being out for the past three years. Thobejane was fired by Baroka chairman, Khurishi Mphahlele, in 2018 after being found guilty for drinking on duty in the team bus along with then team captain Olaleng Shaku and goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke following their 2-0 defeat against Free State Stars. Thobejane told SunSport that he is pleased to be back at the club he promoted to the top flight in 2016. "I am back at home," said Thobejane. "This club is my home. I missed football. I love this game. My focus now is to make sure we produce the best players for this club. We aim to produce players that will help this club challenge for the PSL title and other trophies. I am optimistic that we can do that. We have lot of talent in the province." Thobejane, famously known for his comments that "football can kill you real death" was thankful to Mphahlele for giving him a second chance at the Ga-Mphahlele-based side. Asked if he would love to coach in the top flight again, Thobejane said: "My focus is with development. I have said it before that my goal is to make sure we give our senior coach Thoka Matsimela the best players who can compete for trophies, and play for the national teams." Some players Thobejane have produced are Gift Motupa, Victor Letsoalo, Lantshane Phalane and Believe Mothwa.
