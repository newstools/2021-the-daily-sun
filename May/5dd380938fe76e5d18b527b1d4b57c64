COPS have fired rubber bullets at protesting undertakers outside the Home Affairs offices in Tshwane. The Unification Task Team (UTT) took to the streets of Tshwane, protesting outside the Home Affairs department offices on Tuesday morning. As the protest turned violent, the leaders of UTT suggested that they would have to close their offices around the country which could affect funerals and shutdown the Home Affairs'. UTT wants Home Affairs to allow funeral undertakers who donâ€™t have a certificate of competence, to write designation number examinations. It also wants funeral directors to be allowed to appoint a proxy to conduct some of its duties on their behalf. The Births and Deaths Act stipulates that no funeral undertaker who had not been designated should engage in the activities relating to the registration of deaths.
