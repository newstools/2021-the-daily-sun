AFTER claims by residents they’re being terrorised by a group of thugs, Herman Mashaba visited the Temba cop shop in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, yesterday, 13 May. The ActionSA leader said the report they received was the gang allegedly attacked a resident to steal his vehicle. Mashaba said the group whose members are known to the community is allegedly made up of undocumented foreigners. “We subsequently assisted the victim in reporting the matter to SAPS who reluctantly opened a case following a three-and-a-half-hour engagement on the matter.” Mashaba said the police provided no case number to the victim because their system was “suspiciously” offline. “After hearing all of this I knew I had to do something,” he said. He said their visit to the cop shop was to ensure the wheels of justice started turning. He said they will be conducting an inspection of the area said to be the target of this lawless gang. Mashaba was joined by former Joburg chief of police David Tembe, as well as ActionSA leaders John Moodey and Abel Tau. Station commander Colonel Godfrey Zwane said he did receive a complaint about the police refusing to open a case. “I instructed that a case be opened and investigated properly.” Zwane couldn’t give Mashaba the case number, saying their system was still offline. “The experience they received is not condoned and a proper investigation into the police who refused to open the case will be conducted,” said Zwane.
