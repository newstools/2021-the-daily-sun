SINGER Zonke Dikana is on the road to becoming a pilot. The Tonight singer posted a video of herself inside a plane cockpit on Instagram. In the 25-second video, the multi-award-winning singer is flying the plane while the passenger is taking a video of her, the plane and the view from above. She’s wearing a headset written “pilot”.
