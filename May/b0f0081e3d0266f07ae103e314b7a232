CONSTABLE Atlegang Nkgoeng (28) was buried on Saturday, 29 May. Stationed at Boschkop Police Station in Tshwane, he was killed on Monday, 24 May, while patrolling the N4 highway with a colleague. The colleague is still fighting for his life in hospital. Speaking to Daily Sun after the funeral in Phake, his sister Thabang described her brother as a responsible and hard-working man who was passionate about protecting others. “My brother was a good example to young people, and there’s no doubt he was going far in his career,” she said. “Today he’s gone forever. He’s left me alone and it will take time to get used to not having him around. “Whoever did this must be arrested and face their evil deeds. We’re heartbroken.”  On the day of the incident, the two constables were on patrol at about 1am when they spotted a white VW Polo without number plates near the Solomon Mahlangu on-ramp. They ordered the driver to stop and approached on foot. According to police, two male suspects came out and a scuffle started. Both constables were shot and their firearms taken.  The surviving one was taken to hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg.  Tshwane district commissioner Major-General Hilda Mohajane paid tribute to “a hero who died protecting his community”. Brigadier Vish Naidoo said no arrests had been made and called on anyone with info to come forward.
