A PROPOSED law to allow women to marry more than one man has divided Mzansi. Many have pushed back against polyandry, saying they believe it’s a direct attack on African culture, while others believe people have a right to do as they pleased. Mxolisi Nkomonye (36) from Umhlabuyalingana, northern KZN, said whoever proposed the idea had no respect for African culture. Mxolisi, who has six wives, told Daily Sun: “I’d rather die than allow my wife to have another husband.” Thabani Mkhwanazi (28) from Mtubatuba said women having multiple partners was nothing new, and the law would just make it official. Former IFP president Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi said polyandry had never been practised in Zulu culture. “I’m a Christian first and foremost. I can’t look at the matter through any other prism.” Ethekwini Community Church leader, Pastor Vusi Dube said the law would kill African culture.  LGBTQI+ Project co-ordinator Sbo Khumalo said: “This is a free country. People who like polyandry should do it and those who don’t like it should stay away from it,” he said. “It’s like the law allowing same sex marriage. No one is being forced.” Cultural expert Professor Jabulani Maphalala claimed it was a plan thought out by whites to make Africans neglect their culture. “This is an insult and it left me with many unanswered questions,” he said.
