A TAXI association official (46) believes the ancestors were smiling on the taxi boss who was shot dead on Monday, 24 May. The shooters’ getaway bakkie overturned on the gravel road! The fearful Bhukhanana Taxi Association official, who asked to remain anonymous, said the Ford Bantam crashed shortly after the incident. “The dead man’s ancestors were guarding him, judging from what befell his killers shortly after they shot him,” he said. When the bakkie got closer to his vehicle, one of the hitmen jumped out and fired randomly. “The shooter ran back and hopped onto the back of the bakkie. Fortunately, the shooting took place not far from a police station,” said the official. “Onlookers quickly alerted the police, who then started chasing the bakkie. Residents joined in the chase and the bakkie overturned, killing the driver.” Their target died at the scene! He said the surviving, injured inkabi confessed and fingered the third man who fled into the bushes. He’s apparently a rival taxi boss. “Police found the dead getaway driver’s cellphone and an ID in the bakkie,” said the official. “The dead target and the escaped taxi boss, whose ID was found in the bakkie, were scholar transport business rivals. The deceased is the fifth association member to be murdered recently. “There have been endless meetings aimed at ending disagreements, but we’re not winning the battle. Our own lives are in danger.” Chairman of Santaco in KZN, Sfiso Ntshangase, said: “We strongly condemn the killings. We hope that justice will prevail. “We encourage taxi bosses to iron out their differences rather than resorting to violence.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a murder case was opened at Ntambanana cop shop for investigation.
