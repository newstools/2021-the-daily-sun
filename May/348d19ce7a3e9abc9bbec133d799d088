THE South African Football Players Union (SAFPU) has expressed disappointment on the GladAfrica Championships matter between Sekhukhune United and Royal AM. The Disciplinary Committee awarded Sekhukhune United three points after Polokwane City failed to field the correct number of Under-23 players during a league meeting. However, the PSL disagreed with the ruling. On the final day of the Championship, the trophy was not handed over as the matter remains has not been resolved. Safpu has released a statement regarding the matter which said: “Like a sequel to a bad movie we yet again witnessed torrid fashion in which the GladAfrica Championship rounds off its season. "It is evident that while the players and club staff ploughed in hours of work to make the success of this league, the same cannot be said for boardroom affairs, for if it were the rightful team would have long hoisted the trophy and started preparing for life in the county’s top league. Safpu president Thulangayo Gaoshubelwe explained: “The question that needs an answer immediately is what needs to be done to avoid such occurrence which are not foreign when it comes to the promotion and relegation process in our football. “This is not the first time the things are either uncertain, delayed and ponded at the last minute. Circumstances like these demoralised and break the spirit of players who have fought long and hard to make their dreams a reality. “Safpu would like to amplify the disappointment in which this matter is being dealt with and the lack of urgency and reiterate that the issues like this bring the league in to disrupt.”
