THREE people died in two separate incidents on Limpopo roads on Thursday afternoon, 6 May. The accidents happened in the Waterberg District. The first one took place on the N1 South near the Mokopane off-ramp at Yesterberg where two sedans collided. This came after a 25-year-old driver of a VW sedan allegedly lost control of the vehicle and collided with an oncoming Toyota sedan. The driver of the VW sedan was killed instantly, while the Toyota caught fire. Limpopo transport spokesman Mike Maringa said the other vehicle lost control and overturned. He told Daily Sun two people were rushed to the hospital with serious injuries. “Reckless driving has been cited as a possible cause of the accident,” he said.  In another accident, a driver of a Mazda sedan lost control of the vehicle and hit a tree along the R101 road im Vianen outside Mokopane. Two passengers were certified dead on the spot while the driver and two other passengers escaped with minor injuries. “Preliminary investigations suggest that fatigue could have been the cause of the accident,” said Maringa. Transport and Community Safety MEC, Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya has pleaded with motorists to stop and rest when they are travelling long distances to avoid accidents.
