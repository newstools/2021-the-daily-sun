BANYANA Banyana and Glasgow City forward, Ode Fulutudilu, has been nominated for the Scottish Women's Premier League Player of the Month award for April. The nomination comes after the 31-year-oldâ€™s impressive display since the season started. Fulutudilu was in superb form for her club in the month of April, where she netted seven goals in three matches. She was nominated alongside Brogan Hay (Rangers), Lauren Perry (Forfar Farmington) and Rebecca Galbraith (Spartans) for the gong. Talking to the club TV, an excited Fulutudilu had this to say: "It's lovely to be nominated. I do not get nominated often for things. It is always lovely but then again, anyone could have been nominated because all of us have been doing good in our games. "The competitiveness of our training sessions are at a high level, so when we go to the games it becomes easy. It has been a great start, but there's still a long way to go." "It will be great to receive the award on behalf of the 23 players (teammates) behind me." Among others for her recognition, her goals include back-to-back hat-tricks against Forfar Farmington and Motherwell for City. Fulutudilu's team started the month with a 3-0 win against Celtic, but she only eventually made her debut with a hat-trick in a 7-0 win at Farmington and followed with another hat-trick against Motherwell. She helped her team reclaim the top spot in the Scottish women's top-flight table, with a three-point lead ahead of Rangers, who are second. ?? | @Ode101 on being humbled to be nominated for @SWPL player of month.VOTE ?? https://t.co/TEDn6eFrIo pic.twitter.com/s1OraxvfFW
