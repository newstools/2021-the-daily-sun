IT goes without saying that Tanzania side Simba have "Mount Kilimanjaro" to overturn a 4-0 goal deficit against Kaizer Chiefs. In fact, some have already written Simba Caf Champions League’s obituary, waiting for their last rite to be administered in the quarterfinal return leg at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Saturday. But the club have pointed to factors key to victory against Amakhosi.  Factors to overcome Chiefs: ? “First of all, we must accept as a team we lost the first leg, and we lost by a huge goal margin,” said the club. ? Secondly, our players and the entire technical bench must sit down and discuss what was the real problem in the away game, why did we lose by a huge margin and what should we do to rectify the mistakes before the return leg and win the tie to reach the semi-finals. ? Thirdly, we should all keep the faith, we should not lose hope, we should keep the faith and remain confident that it is possible to turn the tables and progress. ? We should have the belief that if we lost 4-0 away and because football is unpredictable, then we can also win at home with a margin of 4-0 and above. ? And lastly, our togetherness as a team and working together should be our key weapon on Saturday, we want everyone to rally behind the team, we want everyone to pray for the team and by Saturday afternoon, we will have a good result and we will be in the semi-finals.
