SHAKES Mashaba is known to wear his heart on his sleeve and ruffle feathers within the football leadership. Who can forget his dramatic departure from Safa after his public attack of the association’s leadership five years ago? This was after he launched an attack on PSL chairman Irvin Khoza, blaming him for the unavailability of his preferred under-23 players when the former was in charge of the Baby Bafana side in 2011. Back then, Mashaba battled to put together his Under 23 team for the London Olympic qualifiers, told he was not doing his job following the alleged failure to submit a list of his requirements to the PSL. “Why always me?” Mashaba retorted. “Just because I didn’t walk out of the Safa offices to go straight to the PSL chairman doesn't mean I did not do my job. I submitted my schedule, but the system failed me. “I wouldn't call this a misunderstanding. I submitted my schedule and he says I didn’t. But I am used to this. It started in 1997 when I was in charge of the under-20s. Even when I was the Bafana coach, I struggled to get players, and Khoza was always involved. “I am not a liar, but the chairman depicts me as one. This team has the widest range of players to pick from, but I always struggle to get the ones I want.” But Khoza didn’t take the attack lying low and provided facts to contradict Mashaba and rubbished allegations that he was out to sabotage him. Needless to say that the Under 23s couldn’t qualify for the London Olympics.
