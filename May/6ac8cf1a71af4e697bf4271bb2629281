ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer says his players need no motivation in the remaining DStv Premiership matches as they chase a top-two finish. Zinnbauer says they know that they have to win the remaining matches to put pressure on the teams ahead of them and try to finish in a place that will see them qualifying continent competition next season. On Thursday, Pirates kept their chances of securing a spot in Africa next season alive when they defeated AmaZulu 1-0. Gabadinho Mhango scored the match'smatch's only goal in the 76th minute of the game with a well-taken free-kick. Pirates were recently booted out in the quarterfinals of the Caf Confederations Cup with a 5-1 aggregate score by Raja Casablanca.Â  Moreover, the Buccaneers would love to go back and conquer Africa next season. "You have not to encourage the players. They know exactly how is the table in the league, and if you win this game, you come close to the third and second place," Zinnbauer said. "First we have another three games, if you go forward think positive and manage the game as we did today (against AmaZulu), then at the end of the day you can go to the third and second place, but we have to work in the next three games." Pirates remaining three matches will play twice away against TS Galaxy and Baroka. In their last match of the season, they will be against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at Orlando Stadium on 5 June. Pirates are currently third in the log standings with 46 points after 27 matches. They have the same number of points with third-placed Golden Arrows; they are only separated by positive goal difference. After beating AmaZulu, Zinnbauer admitted their performance was not so good, but what matters the most to them at this stage it is the results. Zinnbauer admitted: "Ja, I said before the game the result is important, not the performance."
