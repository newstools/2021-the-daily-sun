SERIAL rapist Sello Mapunya will know his fate on Thursday, 27 May after the Pretoria High Court remanded his case on Wednesday, 26 May. The court heard that the 33-year-old Mapunya, after his arrest in 2019, following an intense investigation relating to a high number of cases around Mamelodi, Atteridgeville, Silverton and Olievenhoutbosch, over 56 women aged between 14 and 45 were robbed and raped at gunpoint by him. Mapunya pleaded guilty to all 101 charges during his previous appearance on Monday, 24 May, which included rape, robbery with aggravating circumstances and house breaking. One of the victims from Phomolong in Atteridgeville told Daily Sun she’d feel better if Mapunya was jailed for life. Recalling what happened in 2016, the 28-year-old woman said she’d never forget the day Mapunya entered her bedroom where she was asleep with her younger sister. “It was in the early hours of the morning. I didn’t hear anyone coming in. I just saw him standing next to my bed. He told me he wanted money and cellphones and when I told him I didn’t have cash, he ordered me to lie down and cover my face before raping me while my little sister was watching,” she said. She said this was the most traumatising experience of her life and that even though she received counselling, she still found it difficult to cope. “Sometimes I get so angry, and I wish this had never happened to me. It’s not easy to live knowing someone violated you and your body like he did.” Judge Papi Masopa postponed the case to Thursday for judgment.
