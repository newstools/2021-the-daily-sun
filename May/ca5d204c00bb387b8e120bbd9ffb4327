TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivandila condemned Kaizer Chiefs to their ninth league loss of the season as they edged them 2-1 at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday. Goals from Thabo Rakhale and Thabo Mnyamane were enough to earn TTM a crucial win. As it later turned out, a second half equaliser from Lebogang Manyama wasn’t enough to earn the visitors a precious point. To lose one or two games could be considered unfortunate; but to pick six points from a possible 21 looks like carelessness, despite the well-known challenges Hunt faces. In fact, Amakhosi would have truly considered themselves fortunate to walk away with a point as TTM let them off the hook. Dylan Kerr's men controlled the match, but were let down by poor finishing, until Mnyamane found the winner from a penalty spot at the very last minute. Rakhale put TTM ahead before the break, controlling a cross well on his chest before firing in the opener. Washington Arubi put in a shift in goals, tipping Samir Nurkovic’s header over the bar, before he was finally beaten by Manyama from a penalty spot. A foul on Nurkovic earned the visitors a penalty, which Manyama initially fluffed before he could round Arubi to slot in the equaliser. Bernard Parker rattled the crossbar as Amakhosi pushed bodies behind their ball, buoyed by the equaliser. But it was Mnyamane who finally came right after he crashed a freekick against the crossbar in the first half, converting a penalty after Siyabonga Ngezana fell him inside the area. It didn’t help Hunt that he lost Njabulo Blom through a second bookable offence in the first half. Hunt has worked hard to lift his players after every defeat, but with four games left, the former Wits trainer will need to draw from his well of experience to guide his side to the top eight. TTM have certainly drawn lots of confidence going to the Nedbank Cup final this weekend.
