ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer was impressed with his side’s attacking play and said they gave the right reaction in their comprehensive 3-0 DStv Premiership victory over bottom side Black Leopards on Thursday. A brace from Tshegofatso Mabasa and a late strike via Gabadinho Mhango eventually gave Pirates the win after they had been held scoreless in the first half, and follows their defeat by the same scoreline at the weekend to Mamelodi Sundowns. “From the first whistle we controlled the game and in the first half we had a lot of chances,” Zinnbauer said. “We were a big danger today, but we did not have that bit of luck in the first half, there was always a leg between the ball and the goal. "In the second half, we came out and scored quickly. Then we went to a little bit more counter-attack playing and controlled the game also. The opponent had to come [and attack us], and we scored the second and the third goal. "Compliments to the team, it was the right reaction from the last game (Sundowns defeat). "We were calm (with their passing) and moved our opponent around a lot, which meant we found the windows to play through the lines. We had a lot of ‘final thirds’ today, a lot of shooting on goal and passing towards the goal. “Normally you have to score three or four times more, but 3-0 is a top result and it was a top performance." The win moves Pirates into fourth in the table, just a point behind Lamontville Golden Arrows in third with a game in hand. They are next in action on Tuesday away at struggling Stellenbosch FC. -MWP
