JACOB “Don King” Mnisi introduced himself to the boxing world in fine style with his J4Joy Boxing Tournament a rousing success. This was the former pro boxer and now business tycoon’s first tournament and he hopes to stage many more in the near future. The Sandton Convention Centre in Joburg was the place to be on Friday as the tourney lived up to all expectations. There was a total of eight-bouts on show which featured three titles – the SA, WBA Pan African and a Gauteng provincial belt. Top boxers from Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal descended in Sandton and showcased their skills.  Tshifhiwa “Spider” Munyai dished out a solid performance to defend his SA lightweight title against Khaya “The Destroyer” Busakwe. The 36-year-old dominated his much younger opponent using all of his to walk away with a TKO win over Busakwe, who was not happy with the stoppage. It was action galore in the main supporting bout where Innocent “Tycoon” Mantengu defeated Luthando “Bullet” Mbumbulwana to become the new WBA Pan African Junior Featherweight champion.  Mantengu, who hails from KwaZulu Natal, was made to work hard for the vacant title by Mbumbulwana from the Eastern Cape. It was a tough physical contest between the two with the early rounds close, but Mantengu pulled clear in the latter stages to eventually clinch the fight on a unanimous points decision. In the other title fight, Layton “King Lay” Gloss beat Tumelo “The Blade” Matsane by TKO to become the new Gauteng Bantamweight champion.
