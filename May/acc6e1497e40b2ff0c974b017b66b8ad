Mamelodi Sundowns will have several days to acclimatise and prepare for their weekend clash with Al Ahly in the African Champions League as they leave Johannesburg on Tuesday for the clash in Cairo. The DStv Premiership champions are leaving nothing to chance for the quarterfinal, first leg, clash on Saturday, where they are pitted against their former coach, Pitso Mosimane. There are no longer any direct flights from Johannesburg to Cairo because of the Covid-19 pandemic, so the club are having to travel via Addis Ababa but will arrive in plenty of time on Wednesday. It will give them a chance for several training sessions ahead of the match, but also much-needed rest after playing on Sunday away in Nelspruit against TS Galaxy where their 1-0 win ensured a seven-point gap at the top of the standings. A reshuffle of the closing DStv Premiership fixtures means Sundowns are now no longer meeting SuperSport United on 19 May, which was sandwiched between the two Champions League ties but instead now play the derby at Loftus Versfeld on 26 May. That means they do not have any commitments between the first leg this Saturday and the return match on 22 May at Atteridgeville. It is the third year in a row that the two clubs meet in the last eight of the competition with Sundowns thrashing Ahly in 2019 but losing 3-1 on aggregate last year. The Egyptian giants went on to win the trophy last November. -SuperSport
