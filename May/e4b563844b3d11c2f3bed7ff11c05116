Bloemfontein Celtic players have allegedly boycotted an urgent meeting called by club chairman, Max Tshabalala, on Tuesday, SunSport has reliably learnt. This was in protest of unpaid bonuses that were owed to them by the club, which resulted in players refusing to train on Monday afternoon, as reported by SunSport. It is understood that only the technical team members honoured the Tshabalala meetin. "It was just embarrassing for the chairman," our source said. "And even members of the technical were treated badly by the chairman who answered them like small boys. One of the technical members asked when will salaries be paid, and he replied 'that's a stupid question'." Technical members are also believed to be in the same predicament with players, but worse as some have not been paid their salaries for months. The players were promised to be paid their bonus last Thursday after they almost went on strike a fortnight ago. However, management made a U-turn last Wednesday when the clubâ€™s General Manager Sainty Molali sent a letter to players informing them about further delays to pay them due to strikes in Mangaung. But it is understood Tshabalala made miraculous financial recovery and paid players their bonuses on Tuesday. "Some of the players told us that they have been receiving their money gradually on Tuesday, and normal training will resume," our source added.
