OWNING a car comes with making great memories and on the flip side, it makes one a target of crime. There have been several hijacking tricks that have been making the rounds on social media and Guard Alert has issued a warning about a new trend. Guard Alert said there’s a new number plate hijacking trend, where the criminals follow motorists to a parking lot. After you leave your car, they remove your number plate and wait.

Guard Alert said when you stop to get your number plate back, guns come out and they take the car. “It’s a very well-rehearsed and organised plan and everything happens very quickly. Other motorists may not be aware of what is happening as you stop the car yourself,” said Guard Alert.
