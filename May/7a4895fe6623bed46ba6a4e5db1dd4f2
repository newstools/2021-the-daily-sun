MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach Rhulani Mokwena believes Pitso Mosimane has stamped his authority on Egyptian giants Al Ahly and his personality has started to show in the side. Sundowns will come up against their former boss Mosimane on Saturday in the first leg of their CAF Champions League quarterfinal in Cairo. It is the first time they have clashed since Mosimane left for Egypt at the end of last season. The latter went on to lift the Champions League with Ahly in 2019-20, and is seeking back-to-back triumphs, but his former side are a formidable stumbling block in his path. And Mokwena says Sundowns can see Mosimane’s footprint on this current Ahly team. "Al Ahly are a very good side. Well coached, and you can see there is a lot of investment from the technical team,” Mokwena said. "In particular, of course, coach Pitso. We know the amount of work he puts in behind the scenes. "You can see because it's reflected in the team, they also have a clear identity and look to start from the back using their centre-halves. "It is clear to see that maybe in comparison to the profile of some teams that we face in the PSL, they average about 40 crosses into the box per 90 minutes, so they're very dominant in their wing play. "It will be an interesting game, and of course, we've got the responsibility to come to Egypt to not just dominate on the pitch.” Sundowns will hope to limit the damage in Cairo and bring Ahly back to South Africa chasing a win. The Egyptian side will still be scarred by a 5-0 loss to Sundowns in Tshwane in April 2019, when Mosimane brilliantly plotted their downfall. -supersport.com
