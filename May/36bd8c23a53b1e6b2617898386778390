 SLAY queens
were left stranded after missing a payment at a hotel. A video
that has been making the rounds on social media has left many people in Mzansi
in stitches. In the
video, one of the three women wearing all black is seen handcuffed and keeps
telling the cleaner to get a job. She can also be heard threatening to sue the
person taking the video. The cleaner
replies and asks them how will they sue someone if they can’t even pay for a
stay in a hotel. The video
has gone viral and someone on Facebook suggested they use their wigs to pay the
bill. “The hotel
should make them wash the dishes and do laundry. They must make them clean five
rooms and change the bedding. They’ll learn a valuable lesson,” wrote Nanki

Masimula said these women were taking chances. “How do you
carry an empty purse all the way from your home and enter somebody else’s
property, eat and drink their most expensive bottle of wine then fail to settle
the bill? Wow.” Tshepo
Mosheo said these were the consequences of living a life you couldn’t maintain. “Class is
earned, ask career women. They will tell you that they don’t need men to spoil
them. Does she even know what a lawyer’s hourly rate is, while she can’t even
settle a hotel bill?” he said. Tidimalo
Mkheswa said this should be a lesson to them. “I always
tell girls not to rely on a man. They just have to be independent and enjoy
their life. Look at these poor girls. If they had their own money, they
wouldn’t be in this situation now,” wrote Tidimalo.
