FOR 16 years Linah lived peacefully in her five-roomed shack. But under the floorboards lurked a life-threatening secret. SHE DIDN’T KNOW HALF OF HER HOUSE WAS ABOUT TO BE SWALLOWED BY A GIANT HOLE! Linah Maloba (56) from Phomolong in Saulsville, Tshwane, told Daily Sun she went to work at Atlyn Mall in Tshwane on Tuesday 11 May. But at about 8am she got the sad news that her shack had been swallowed up. “When I received the call from a neighbour I went weak,” she said. The mother of five said her double bed and headboard, wardrobe, blankets, clothes, washing machine, four-plate stove, groceries, TV and other items are gone. The R7 000 she was saving for her son’s college fees was also swallowed.  Linah appealed for help as she doesn’t have a home, clothes, food or blankets. Neighbour Gladys Swana (58) was scared her house is next. ALSO READ:
