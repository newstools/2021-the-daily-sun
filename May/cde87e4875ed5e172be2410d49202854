Police Minister Bheki Cele has bashed all self-appointed community leaders, blaming them for the recent chaos in Zandspruit. He said this during his visit to the kasi on Saturday, 22 May, accompanied by Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko and other government officials. Cele said corruption and criminal activities start with so-called community leaders. He said a lot was revealed during a meeting he had with some of leaders before addressing the community. “It’s alarming there are people who sell land, erect shacks and force people to pay rent to them. Who gave those people land ownership? That’s where criminality starts in this kasi and it’s going to stop,” said Cele.  He said the provincial police commissioner will send a team that will focus on all issues the kasi’s facing. “I’ve been made aware of over 500 undetected and pending cases that were reported but nothing has been done to follow them up. I apologise to the community and vow the cases will be reviewed.” Cele said he was given three weeks to respond to the grievances tabled by the community and promised to come back. “I’ll come back with results of what we have done since our visit here. In the meantime, please behave yourselves and work with the police that have been deployed to restore peace in this area,” said Cele. Zandspruit came to a standstill on Wednesday morning, 19 May, after nine alleged gang members were kidnapped, brutally beaten and burnt. A group of about 200 gatvol residents went out to search for the boys who were allegedly robbing the community.  The alleged gang was forcibly taken to the local sport ground where they were assaulted and burnt. Six of the nine gang members have died and three remain in a critical condition in hospital. Six suspects were arrested for murder, attempted murder and kidnapping. They will appear in the Randburg Magistrates Court on Monday, 23 May.
