DUDU Myeni has done a Jacob Zuma-like no-show! She didn’t show up to testify on Tuesday, 25 May at the Zondo Commission after being summoned. Her lawyer, Advocate Nqabayethu Buthelezi, didn’t give convincing reasons, except to say her lawyers would apply for a postponement of her evidence. That didn’t go down well with commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, who instructed the secretary to lay a criminal complaint against the former SAA chairwoman at a cop shop. “It’s not acceptable that Ms Myeni didn’t comply with summonses and present herself to the hearing today,” said Zondo. “From what I’ve heard there appears to be no valid reasons for her not to appear. “The secretary of the commission must take steps to lay a criminal complaint with the police against her for acting in breach of summons and the Commissions Act.” He directed that Myeni avail herself in the afternoon to avoid further steps.

Evidence leader Advocate Kate Hofmeyr told Zondo it’s a criminal offence to not appear before the commission when one has been served with summons. “Chair, there’s nothing left. It’s now time that the law should take its course,” said Hofmeyr. This will be the second time the commission opens a criminal complaint against Myeni after it did the same last November when she revealed the identity of a witness despite an order from Zondo not to do so. Buthelezi said the commission should try and find another way to resolve the matter. He said Myeni had planned to go somewhere but cancelled to be on standby, should the commission want her to be present. “I have to express my dismay and disappointment at how things have turned out,” said Buthelezi. “It’s disheartening to observe how the evidence leaders purport to seek to project this commission as a prosecution while this commission is a fact-finding mission where witnesses need to account and assist the commission.”
