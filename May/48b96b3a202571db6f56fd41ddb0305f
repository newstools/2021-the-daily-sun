WHEN Angela Motsusi was 17 years old, she lost her mother to cancer. She attributes her loss to poor management by healthcare facilities. She told Daily Sun that her mum kept being turned away without proper diagnosis until it was too late. So Angela made a vow that in her mum’s memory, no patient will come to her care without being assessed thoroughly. “This led me to become a professional nurse,” said the 33-year-old from Kagiso, Mogale City. After working as a nurse for 10 years, Angela has started Unjani Clinic Braamfischer in Braamfischer, Soweto. She partnered with Unjani Clinics, a non-profit company. She said this was her dream come true. “My clinic will provide primary healthcare services in minor ailments, STIs, wound care, family planning, HIV testing and counselling, wellness screening, cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, antenatal care and postnatal care,” said Angela. She said the clinic will officially launch on 17 June and open from Monday to Saturday. “I pride myself with highly skilled nurses and administrators.” She studied nursing at Chris Hani Baragwanath Nursing College and graduated in 2010. She is also an HIV activist. “I found out that I was positive in 2011. This led to depression. I experienced a lot of rejection and stigma that propelled me to activism. I equipped myself with knowledge relating to HIV case management,” said Angela. She’s the co-founder of HIV survivors and partners network, which deals with advocacy regarding sexual health and reproductive health rights of mixed-status couples. She’s currently busy with the UequalsU campaign, which encourages treatment adherence and reduces stigma and discrimination. “This will help end the HIV epidemic,” said Angela.
