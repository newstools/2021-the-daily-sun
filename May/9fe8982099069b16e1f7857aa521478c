Speaking to Daily Sun, Donovan said he could not be more excited to be back for another season. “Now that we have a brand-new set and a new cast member, we’re comfortable with the format and you can already feel even in episode one that there is a whole new energy. “We’ve really spent the time getting the right guests to match our energy so we’re expecting fun, spontaneous, highly charged episodes,” he said. The show has a new addition – media personality and comedian Nina Hastie will be joining Donovan and co-hosts Mojak Lehoko, Lihle Msimang and Rouge as one of the hosts.
