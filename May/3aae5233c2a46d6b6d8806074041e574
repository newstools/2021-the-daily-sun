AMBITIOUS Royal AM chairman, Andile Mpisane, said he will step aside as a player from next season if his GladAfrica Championship side are promoted to the PSL. His club, along with Sekhukhune United, are affected by legalities, with the prospect of gaining promotion to the elite league. The youngest ever chairman in the professional rank Mzansi football, Mpisane was playing for his club on their way to ending the 2020-21 Championship table with 51 points, one point ahead of second-placed Sekhukhune United. However, Mpisane’s dream of a PSL promotion lies squarely on Friday’s decision, where Polokwane City have taken the matter to the Johannesburg High Court for review of the arbitrator’s decision. In his dream, Mpisane pictures himself as a PSL chairman and said he would stop playing and focus on being the boss. As a player in the just ended season, Mpisane, son of Shauwn Mkhize, didn’t start in a single match for the club this season, despite being registered. He only played 11 minutes of football, coming on as substitute 14 times. In fact, in his career, he has only played three games. Mpisane, who turned 20 in March, initially made his PSL debut in the 2018-19 season, playing for Royal Eagles, the club that was co-owned by Mkhize and father, Sbu Mpisane. “To be where we are, like my mom said, we have mixed feelings and we don’t know what more to say,” said Mpisane.
