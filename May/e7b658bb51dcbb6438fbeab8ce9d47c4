MALIAN referees are lucky to be alive after they cheated death at the hands of angry football supporters in Senegal. Babou Traore, Modibo Samake and Mohamadou Keita were officiating in the Caf Confederation Cup quarter-final match between ASC Jaraaf of Thies and Cotonsport at Lat Dior Stadium. Jaraaf won the tie on an away goal, the tie having finished 2-2, and thus qualified for the semi-finals. Sibiri Sanou Arnaud netted the opener for Cotonsport before Albert Diene equalised for the hosts. Pape Abdou Ndiaye scored the winner and all appeared to be all over when Traore blew the final whistle. But drama followed when Jaraaf players charged at the match officials questioning the quality of officiating. Fans of ASC Jaraaf expressed their anger that a supposedly third goal was ruled offside. Just when the players walked off the pitch, the referees were reportedly pushed to the floor and beaten. The referees left the pitch under heavy security protection. It is not the first time in recent years that fans have caused such scenes in football games.
