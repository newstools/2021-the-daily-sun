SOCIALLY, we now live in a mathematical world where what one does on the left they must also do to the right. The talks of gender equity are now more prevalent than ever. As the gender construct begins to tilt, the common practices are now becoming a thing of the past. Gone are the days when a woman will have to wait for a man to ask her out. More and more women are now shooting their shot and are going for what they want. This is the same analogy Tiffany & Co., a luxury American jewellery retailer, used when they recently launched their diamond male engagement rings. While a lot is often said about a woman’s engagement ring and the diamonds that go with it, Tiffany has now also made diamonds a man’s best friend. They introduced an elegant diamond ring range for women to pop the question. The Charles Tiffany Setting engagement ring range has launched six new engagement rings that have now made diamonds a man’s best friend. Ranging from black titanium to silver and emerald, this range offers some of the world’s best cut diamonds with a prize tag starting from R500 000. With the trendy advertisement promoting women to shoot their shot and ask him for a man’s hand in marriage, the range is enough to make any man want to say “I do”.
