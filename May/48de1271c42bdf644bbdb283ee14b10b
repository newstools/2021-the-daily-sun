SWALLOWS FC winger Kgaogelo Sekgota says they are determined to return to winning ways at the expense of wounded Kaizer Chiefs. The teams will meet in a DStv Premiership match at FNB Stadium on Wednesday (5pm). Amakhosi are still reeling from a shocking 2-1 defeat to Nedbank Cup champions Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in their last league game a week ago. In fact, the Naturena based outfit have been struggling to collect points in their past five matches having registered just one win, one draw and three defeats. But Sekgota stressed that they won’t undermine Chiefs to avoid dropping crucial points in their mission to finish the season within the top eight. Swallows hold the record of having the most draws (16) in the league this season. Although the Birds have only lost just one match this season, they have been struggling to get maximum points having drawn their last four league matches. Said Sekgota: “Chiefs are a good team and we respect them. They can’t be bad overnight. We have our own ambitions and we have set our mindset on getting victory. What they are going through is not important to us, but what’s crucial is the 90 minutes on the pitch.” The speedy player said having a short break due to the Nedbank Cup final has helped coach Brandon Truter to focus on fine-tuning their attack while minimising mistakes they made in their 1-1 draw with Maritzburg United on 30 April. Explained Sekgota: “The short break was important as it helped us have enough rest and restore our confidence. We focused on tactics and on how to win a one on one battle. “The coach has a plan and we will follow his instructions, with the experience we have in the team I have no doubt that we will win the match.” But Sekgota knows that Chiefs won’t back down easily, having lost 1-0 in their last league meeting last November. “They would try to play differently this time, but we are ready for anything they’ll throw at us. “We know what we need to do to win the game,” added Sekgota.
