AKANI Simbine has upped the ante in his preparation for the upcoming 2020 Olympic Games, paying no attention to the doubt surrounding the future of the event. With just under three to go before Japan can declare the Games open, doubt continues to grow over whether athletes will turn up, with the East Asia country in the midst of a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections. But Simbine, the South African 100m record-holder, is not too overly concerned. Like most athletes, he is fully focused on his preparation as he aims to better his previous Olympics record. “I haven't even been looking at that kind of stuff. I've just been focused on myself as an athlete, making sure I train as hard as I can and be the best athlete I can be,” said Simbine. “I cannot now look at other things and comment from people saying they are against us running or don’t want us to compete, and we still have a competition. What we do is not just physical. It is also mental. You have to prepare your mind in order to compete at your best.” Simbine recently anchored the South African team to gold at the World Athletics Relay Championships in Poland. He came fifth at the 2016 Rio Olympics and is the 100m SA record holder with a time of 9.89 second, set in July 2016. The Tembisa-born sprinter was a World Championship finalist in the 100m in 2017 and fourth in 2019. He was also 100m champion at the 2018 African Championships and the 2018 Commonwealth Games. In the 4 x 100m relay, he helped South Africa become champion at the African Championships, both in 2016 and 2018, and was placed second at the 2018 Commonwealth Games with a SA record time of 38.24 seconds.
