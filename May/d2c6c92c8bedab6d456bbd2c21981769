KAIZER Chiefs can certainly do with a bit of a break, especially their coach Gavin Hunt. The coach’s head was in a spin following yet another DStv Premiership loss, this time to lowly Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) who pipped them 2-1 on Tuesday. The loss has left Amakhosi in what is slowly becoming an insurmountable mountain to climb in order to secure a top-eight spot. The 2013-14 league champions have only won two in 14 matches, and there is hardly an area of their game to speak positively of. “It’s very difficult to explain. I don’t know. It’s mind-boggling. I feel we deserved a little bit more,” said Hunt. “We made mistakes and it’s inexcusable to make mistakes like that… we just battle on. Now with four games left, we certainly have to win all four and take it from there.” A break would certainly do Chiefs a world of good, as Hunt said so himself. “This is the longest break we will have now with seven days, so we will have a few days (off) after what we’ve been through since December,” “We will try and regroup and then go again,” Hunt explained. The Soweto giants were sunk by a last-minute penalty, well taken by Thabo Mnyamane. This was after defender Siyabonga Ngezana conceded a second penalty in two matches, putting Amakhosi’s “backs against the wall”. Said Hunt: “The same player. It certainly gets your back against the wall. It doesn’t help at all, but ja, it’s what it is. It was an even game until that red card, and then the defending.” TTM not only gained vital points in their battle for survival, but the win will surely serve as a confidence booster ahead of their Nedbank Cup final against Chippa United on Saturday.
