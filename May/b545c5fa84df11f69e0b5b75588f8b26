THEY were allegedly sent to kill the sangoma. But instead of going through with it, the “hitmen” demanded money from him. They even said they’d kill the person who sent them if the sangoma paid R20 000. Sangoma Mavusi Gqola from Mfuleni told Daily Sun he started receiving messages and calls two weeks ago. He said people told him to quit politics and threatened to shoot him. He said they told him they’d been sent to kill him but would spare him from the goodness of their hearts if he gave them R20 000. When the sangoma tried to negotiate with the “hitmen” to get the money, they sent him a chilling message. “Ke yimbambe njalo uzakuva izithonga (Just wait you will hear the gunshots),” read one of the messages, which the sangoma showed to this reporter. Sangoma Mavusi said it worried him that the people know his movements and where his wife works. “They threatened to get my wife if they don’t get me and said I’d regret not following their instructions. “When I went to get the jab they told me they knew where I’d gone with my wife. It looks like they live around here and know my movements,” he said. He said the cell number that calls and texts him is switched off most of the time, making it difficult to track the user. He said he won’t pay a cent and reported the matter to the cops. Sangoma Mavusi, who plans to run as an independent candidate in the upcoming local government election, said he believes people are scared of his popularity ekasi as he runs several feeding scheme projects. “At one point a local politician threatened some of the people I work with not to accept food from me,” he said. “This is an agenda to threaten me to dump my plan to run as a councillor. “They can threaten all they want, but I’ll not stop taking care of my community.” Western Cape cops spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident. “The mentioned case number is an intimidation case registered for investigation,” said Van Wyk. “This case is still under investigation.”
