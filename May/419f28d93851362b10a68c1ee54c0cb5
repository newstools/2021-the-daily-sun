BUSINESSMAN Theo Baloyi, who left his job as an accountant to start his own shoe brand Bathu, continues to thrive. He recently opened another store in Secunda, Mpumalanga. The grand opening was attended by the brand’s ambassadors Lamiez Holworthy, Khanyi Mbau and Somizi Mhlongo. Lerato Kganyago and Vusi Nova performed at the opening. Speaking to Daily Sun, Theo said when he started the brand, he never imagined himself opening his 25th store. “When we started out in a one room in Alexandra, I never imagined we’d be here today. “We only had one mission – to reignite hope and create sustainable jobs for the people in my community. “Little did I know the dream and vision would grow into something this big one day. “I’m very thankful to everyone who’s been supporting the brand because if it weren’t for them, everything would not have been possible.” ALSO READ | DJ TIRA LAUNCHES YOUDEH APP! The businessman said he hoped to have a strong business presence on the continent in the next 10 years. “We have a very strong market in South Africa and online in the SADC regions as people outside the boarders have come out to support the brand. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years I see this brand having a very strong presence across the continent.” Khanyi told Daily Sun how her partnership with the shoe brand came about. “I was very fascinated by the brand. I related well because it’s authentic, like me. “Everyone knows how I got to be where I am today. And just like the brand, everyone has watched it grow over the years. I’m self-made, like the brand. “I wouldn’t have passed the opportunity to be part of such an amazing journey.”
