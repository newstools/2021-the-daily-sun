SPEAKING on Friday, 28 May, outgoing defence force head General Solly Shoke said their purpose was to bring peace and contribute to stability in Africa. Shoke gave his final address at the Pretoria Military Sport Club in Thaba-Tshwane before handing over the reins to General Rudzani Maphwanya, who’ll officially take over on 1 June. He thanked his family for their support, as well as former president Jacob Zuma and President Cyril Ramaphosa for their confidence in him. Shoke thanked Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, the military command and soldiers for their co-operation. “At times, these soldiers are the least acknowledged. You’ve made this defence force what it is today and executed your tasks under sometimes difficult circumstances, with dwindling resources at your disposal,” he said. “Discipline is the cornerstone of any organisation’s success. It was through your discipline that we were able to succeed in all missions. “Don’t despair or get discouraged by the negative publicity you sometimes get. However, we must learn from our mistakes and move forward as better soldiers.” Shoke said it was time to start appreciating the good the defence force was doing for the country and its people. “We should collectively begin getting rid of negative elements in our midst that bring our good name into disrepute,” he said. “I’m confident to leave behind men and women who’re committed to the Constitution under the capable leadership of Lieutenant-General Maphwanya.” Maphwanya was sworn in by Judge President Dunstan Mlambo. Ramaphosa and other dignitaries attended the ceremony.
