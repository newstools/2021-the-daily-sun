FOOTAGE of EFF leader, Julius Malema threatening to kill a member of the Pan-African Parliament is making rounds on social media. Malema made this statement during a sitting in Midrand, Joburg, on Thursday 27 May. On the day, the parliament was meant to hold elections for the new bureau but they were halted after one member tested positive for the coronavirus. The drama started when the MPs refused to vacate the premises. ALSO READ: WOMAN GETS 17 YEARS FOR KILLING BABY! The sitting was adjourned by the acting president Fortune Charumbira. The members then started shouting and accusing Charumbira of using Covid-19 as a tactic to delay the elections. In the video, Malema is seen pointing a finger at a fellow MP and saying: “I’ll kill you outside, outside the sitting, I’ll kill you.” One member of parliament is also heard reporting Malema to the sitting president, saying the EFF leader has threatened to kill someone. The Pan-African Parliament spokesman Jeffery Onganga told News24 they could not comment on the matter at this stage as the president had not ruled on the issue before the sitting adjourned. The EFF could not be reached for comment. The sitting is set to resume on Monday, 31 May.
