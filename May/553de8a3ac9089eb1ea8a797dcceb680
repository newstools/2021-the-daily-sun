The hall was officially opened by Buthelezi, who felt honoured that his wife’s dedication to improving people’s lives didn’t go unnoticed.  Municipal manager Nkosenye Zulu said they wanted encourage more good deeds in society. “We want people to have the spirit of ubuntu and go the extra mile in changing the lives of others,” said the mayor. “We want them to see that being selfless bears fruits.” Zulu said they also wanted to preserve the history of Ulundi. Mayor Wilson Ntshangase said the construction of the halls was part of the 2021/2022 budget and R442 736 806 had been set aside for this.
