CONTRALESA has announced the suspension of initiation schools this year due to third wave threats. Speaking to Daily Sun, Contralesa President Kgoshi Mathupa Mokoena confirmed there will be no initiation schools in eight provinces, except the Eastern Cape. “Firstly, we want to appreciate and thank parents who respected our calls in 2020 that let’s suspend the winter initiation schools. Even in summer, they respected it.” He said since no one knew what to expect with the third wave, it was important to be cautious and keep initiation schools closed. “As responsible leadership, we can’t be careless. And we are also aware the stats are going up. As we are speaking today, we have more than 1000 people who are infected. “And again, we are aware that we don’t have enough staff to look after those who are not well at the hospitals,” said Kgoshi Mokoena. He said although this decision doesn’t affect the Eastern Cape, the province’s kings and royal leadership have assured Contralesa they’d put all measures in place to make sure initiates will be safe on the mountain. He said they gave them risk assessment strategy documents which outlined all the dos and don’ts. “On that score, we have decided to allow Eastern Cape to continue because of those reasons. But we put it to them to say, we want to get reports every week as to what’s happening,” he said.
