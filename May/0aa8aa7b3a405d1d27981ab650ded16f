AFTER a day at work a station commander took the state car, headed home not knowing that death was waiting for him on the road. The 56-year-old KZN station commander was shot and killed in a state vehicle when unknown suspects opened fire at him last night. Colonel Jabulanu Ndawonde, who was stationed at Ndwedwe Police Station, died in a hail of bullets. KZN spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a station commander of Ndwedwe cop shop was gunned down at Bhamshela Taxi Rank. She said Ndawonde was heading home when the occupants of a bakkie opened fire on the state vehicle that he was travelling in. “It’s alleged that at about 6.30pm, Colonel Ndawonde was on his way home, using a state motor vehicle, when a white NP200 mini-pickup truck overtook him and the occupants started shooting at him,” she said. Mbele said Ndawonde succumbed to his wounds. “A case of murder has been opened at Nsuze Police Station. We believe the matter will be handed over to the Hawks to proceed with the investigation,” said Mbele. Mbele said the motive of the killing was not yet known.
