RISING hip hop and rap artist Sydney Norhushe (24) is hoping to change the music game. The artist, whose stage name is King Aicko, said from a young age he wanted to be a star. “I used to listen to local hip hop artists and imitate them,” he said. “I started writing my own songs and soon started performing those songs for my peers. “But it was only last year that I released my first EP titled Iphupho, which means dream. “Iphupho is based on my dreams and wishes of becoming the next big thing in the music world. “With hard work, consistency and dedication my dreams will come true.” ALSO READ: SGAQAGAQA DUMPS THE QUEEN! This year he’s working on his second EP, Different Flavours. “I call it Different Flavours because the EP is a mix of different genres. “This EP is almost done and it will be out before the end of June,” he said. King Aicko grew up in KwaLanga in the Eastern Cape. “I believe my township strongly influenced me to like rap music. “As early as 2010 I’d listen to the likes of Chris Brown. “In 2011 I started reciting hip hop and rap music. This is when I started doing local shows. It was a defining moment for me because people instantly loved my work.” “I’d say my early breakthrough happened in 2014 when I was invited by Bay TV. That same year I also signed under SK Records. Then I worked on a song, Siyasebenza.” He then met Jay Bee, a house producer, promoter and video editor. “Together we worked on a song titled Ndibuhlungu. The song was written by me and it’s based on a true story,” said King Aicko.
