WITH local government elections around the corner, the villagers of Orgengele see no reason to vote. This is because residents of the village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, get their drinking, washing, cooking and cleaning water from a muddy dam which is also used by livestock. Gatvol residents told Daily Sun they had been sharing the muddy water with cows since their taps went dry almost 10 years ago. They said they reported the matter to their councillor and the municipality multiple times, but no action was taken. Nkosinathi Ntuli (32) said: “Life is hard here. It’s like we live in the desert because the water issue has been reported many times but no one comes to assist. I don’t believe we will ever have clean running water in our taps again,” he said. Ntombizodwa Xulu (39) said they had to boil their drinking water to make sure they didn’t get diseases like cholera. “Many of us are unemployed and we can’t afford to go to other areas to buy water,” she said. Ntombizodwa said the councillor knew about the situation, but had done nothing to help. Councillor Sibongiseni Ndlovu said the issue affected the whole of Mtubatuba. “There was a water scheme that was supposed to start working in January, but the municipality discovered an incompetent contractor had made a mistake. Now we are back to square one,” said the councillor. Umkhanyakude municipal spokesman Mduduzi Dlamini said the delays in the construction of the water scheme that was meant to serve the area was caused by a lack of funds. “The construction of the water scheme is sitting at 50% completion, but it has since stopped since the funds were finished. We have asked the provincial Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs to help us with funds, so we are still waiting for them. We are a rural municipality, so we don’t make money through revenue, we rely on the budget that is given to us by the province,” said Dlamini.
