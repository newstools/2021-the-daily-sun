FOUR men suspected of raping a woman in front of her husband were killed on Tuesday, 18 May by angry residents in Zandspruit, Honeydew. Community leader Kenneth Lekalakala said he was patrolling the area at about 11pm when he heard whistling coming from the direction of a soccer field. “The community started mobilising. There’s a gang of nine that’s terrorising us. They normally start at midnight and target various sections ekasi,” he said. Lekalakala said the gang recently broke into a shack and raped a woman. “All nine of them attacked and raped a woman in front of her husband,” he said. “They forced the couple to have sex. This angered community members, who felt things were getting out of hand and they had to put a stop to it.” The community initially caught two of the suspects. “They were forced to expose the rest, after which all nine were rounded up and attacked. Police were called to the scene but only two vehicles responded.” Lekalakala said law-abiding citizens ekasi constantly have to look over their shoulder.  Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed that nine people were assaunted and burnt alive. “Four of them died on the scene and five were rushed to hospital,” said Makhubele. Police were still searching for the people responsible for the deaths and attempted murder of the alleged gangsters. This is a developing story.
