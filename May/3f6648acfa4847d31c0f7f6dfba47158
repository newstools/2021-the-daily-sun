Title favourites Raja Casablanca boast an outstanding CAF Confederation Cup away record ahead of a quarterfinal first leg against Orlando Pirates in South Africa on Sunday. A Moroccan outfit that includes star forwards in Soufiane Rahimi and Ben Malango won all six group matches by scoring five goals at home and eight away while conceding none. They became the team to beat in the African equivalent of the Uefa Europa League after outclassing 2020 runners-up Pyramids in Egypt, where few visiting clubs win, much less by three goals. Raja are the equal fifth most successful side in CAF competitions with seven titles, including being African champions three times. PIRATES V RAJA Former runners-up Pirates host Raja against a backdrop of media criticism with one Johannesburg daily summarising their performance in a midweek domestic league match as "abject". "I think the minds of many players were on the Raja match," said German coach Josef Zinnbauer after a goalless draw with Stellenbosch ended faint hopes of overtaking leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. "Raja rank among the best clubs in Africa and we have to improve dramatically to have a chance of beating them and going on and become the first South African winners of this competition."   -SuperSport
