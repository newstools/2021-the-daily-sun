LONA Jack was left devastated by the rape and murder of her 22-year-old son Lonwabo. The 41-year-old mum from Nyanga, Cape Town, knows the family of the suspect. They’d promised to visit her house to ask for forgiveness, but that never happened. “It’s been two weeks since my son was murdered. I was told they’d come to our house to talk to us about what happened, but they never did,” she said. “My son is gone and is not coming back again. All they needed to do was to come to us and say sorry. I understand that they didn’t send him to do this, but as parents they should have come to us.” Lonwabo’s body was found outside the house of a friend who was hosting his birthday party on Sunday, 18 April. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested and appeared in the Athlone Magistrates Court. Lona said she knew that her son was gay, and she’d completely accepted it. “He’d call me ‘my girl’ and we got on well together. I knew he was gay when he was only two years old. I’m hurt and I’ll never forgive the person who killed him,” she said. Lonwabo’s uncle Monwabisi (57) said the whole family had accepted Lonwabo and was proud of him. “He was the only gay person in our family and that made him special. At first we didn’t understand how these things worked. But he’d teach us. This is a big loss for us,” he said. Anele Sibamba, an activist from the Triangle Project, said they were happy that someone was being held accountable. “The suspect is 17 years old. Whether he killed him alone or is protecting other suspects, we don’t know. What matters is that someone is paying for killing Lonwabo,” she said.
