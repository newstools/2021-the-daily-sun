I’d like to respond to Norman Maake’s letter published on 4 May about the state’s responsibility in education. Although it’s true that government must fix schools, I strongly believe we must fix ourselves first. It’s often in our black communities where you’ll find boys passing by a school and throwing stones or breaking windows just for fun. No one claims responsibility and parents also refuse to pay once the culprits have been fingered. It’s in our communities where you’ll find school furniture in plain sight at a tavern. Until we change our mindset, take ownership and responsibility for our own property, we won’t see progress. Letter by Tony Makgeledisa Mabopane
