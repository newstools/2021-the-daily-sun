A well-known businessman and owner of a security company in Mpumalanga has been remanded in police custody. The 55-year-old accused appeared before the Middleburg Magistrate Court in Mpumalanga on Thursday, 6 May. He was arrested on Wednesday and is facing charges of fraud and money laundering. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the accused was joined in court by his co-accused (46), a real estate agent who was sought and arrested by the Hawks’ Investigation team at her hideout in Boksburg in Ekurhuleni on Monday 26 April. “It has now been established that the pair was working together when selling the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) houses without the knowledge of Tokologo and Rockdale-based owners. “The buyers allegedly paid money into the co-accused’s business trust account and as soon as the money was received into her account, it would be transferred to her private account and also to this well-known businessman’s account as well as others. “Both are expected back in court on Tuesday, 11 May 2021. More arrests have not been ruled out as investigations continue,” said Sekgotodi.
