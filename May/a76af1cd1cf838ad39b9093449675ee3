SEPTEMBER is national Oral Health Month to remind us to keep our mouths clean. We asked Tshepo Sibiya (23) from Krugersdorp how he keeps his mouth clean. “I make sure I brush my teeth every morning and drink a lot of water to keep my mouth clean,” he said. Refiloe Mokoena (30) from Westonaria said: “I brush my teeth twice a day: in the morning when I wake up and in the evening before I go to bed. “I also floss twice a week to remove dirt that gets stuck in-between my teeth.” Not cleaning your mouth can cause bacteraemia – a disease caused by bacteria travelling from the mouth and into the bloodstream. Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums usually caused by a bacterial infection, and if not attended to, it can turn into more severe forms of periodontal diseases that cause gums to separate from the teeth. Recommended oral hygiene diet: Apples: Eating apples regularly helps increase the production of saliva in the mouth while the fibre in them stimulates the gums. Carrots: They are full of fibre, crunchy and contain water which makes them an excellent choice for dental health. Parsley: Apart from being high in antioxidants, parsley is an anti-bacterial agent that helps maintain dental health. Leafy greens: The leafy green minerals and vitamins help strengthen tooth enamel and their low-calorie content can help prevent harm to the body. Cheese and milk: Both are high in protein and calcium, which are required for tooth enamel.
