FORMER Eskom CEO Matshela Koko has accused the Zondo Commission of treating witnesses differently. He said he was treated harshly and others favourably. Among the people Koko claimed were “blue-eye” witnesses was former Glencore CEO Clinton Ephron and former Eskom legal head, Suzanne Daniels. He said Ephron lied by saying President Cyril Ramaphosa was not chairman of Glencore when it issued hardship notice in 2013. “He was the CEO. He can’t forget his boss,” said Koko yesterday. He said Daniels once sent him an email and blind-copied the infamous info portal email address that allegedly belonged to Gupta lieutenant Salim Essa. “Daniels ought to have known she sent a blind copy of the suspension letters to the info portal, belonging to Essa. “I didn’t even know because it was a blind copy. People cannot deliberately lie and get away with it,” he said. He said these witnesses, and many others, had been allowed to lie without any consequences to advance “the Koko hunt”. “When it is matters that affect Koko, your investigators and legal team are very quick to make follow-ups, but they have blue-eyed witnesses. “I still don’t understand why Daniels’ computer was not made available to experts. I know why they are protecting her. They don’t want her evidence to be disturbed,” he said. Koko said evidence leaders concentrated on gossip in Thuli Madonsela’s report, OUTA and the media instead of documented evidence. “I’m here for the sixth time. For the first time I feel aggrieved because I have not told my story. I’ve submitted an affidavit and I was told that I must take it as read. But the way things go, I don’t think my counsel will be given a chance to re-examine me.” Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo assured him the lawyer would get a chance to ask or clarify certain matters. Koko distanced himself from irregular payment of R36 million that was paid to Trillian for the work that was allegedly done by Regiments. “The invoice came to me and I refused to pay,” he said.
