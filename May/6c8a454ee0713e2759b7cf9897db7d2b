THE Gauteng highway patrol unit on Wednesday, 4 May seized an AK-47, R5 and pistol, as well as more than 30 rounds of ammunition, in a BMW that was reported stolen. Speaking to Daily Sun, Captain Mavela Masondo said police noticed a suspicious silver BMW with three occupants. “The suspects abandoned the vehicle and a subsequent search of the BMW led to police discovering an AK-47 rifle, R5 rifle, a pistol and more than 30 rounds of ammunition,” he said. “Preliminary investigations revealed the car had been reported stolen at Eden Park Police Station in April 2021.”  A manhunt for the suspects is under way and the firearms will be subjected to forensic examination and ballistic testing to determine if they were used in commission of crimes.  “This recovery brings to a total of 31 firearms and 435 rounds of ammunition that were seized by police in Gauteng since Friday 30, April,” he said.  Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela was pleased, saying the weapons might have been used to rob and kill innocent people.
