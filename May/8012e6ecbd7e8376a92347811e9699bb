PASTOR Maxwell Oyewumi (34) struggled with asthma as a young man, so he vowed to help everyone he can to live a better life. Today, he is the coordinator of Boys Lead Foundation. Oyewumi said the foundation, which was founded in Canada in 2019 by William Owolabi, provides opportunities for black boys between the ages of eight and 16. “Principals select boys in need and we help with nurturing through our mentorship clubs,” said Oyewumi. He said through their Help in Cross Programme, they provide scholarship and pay pupils’ school fees. “We ask the boys what they want to do after grade 12 or what kind of business they want to do. Then we provide the necessary training programme in leadership and communication skills,” said Oyewumi. He said through their Juvenile Support Programme, they visit prisons and give inmates books and assist with counselling. “It could be rehabilitation and acceptance of the past and how to bring change to the community.” He said their programmes ran online for three Saturdays, and pupils received a certificate of attendance. After graduation, they still benefitted from the foundation. “The same programmes are run in Canada, Nigeria and the USA,” he said. They’re currently operating in Gauteng and planning to spread their wings throughout Mzansi before the end of the year. “As it says in the Bible, when you give you will receive,” said Oyewumi, who is the leader of Summit Christian Centre in Lenasia, south of Joburg. Leaquid Khan, the principal of Montanus Primary School in South Hills, Joburg, said he was honoured to be one of the beneficiaries. “Boys Lead Foundation is making a difference to our pupils. This is an action for change. It shows the spirit of ubuntu,” said Khan.
