A 57-YEAR-OLD security guard has been arrested after a teenager was killed during violent shutdown protests in Mangaung. It’s alleged a group of protesters were attacking a warehouse in Dr Belcher Road, Bloemfontein. The security guard , who was alone at the time, allegedly fired a shot to scare the mob but hit a 15-year-old boy. “The boy died at the scene. The security guard was arrested and will appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on a charge of murder,” said police spokesman, Brigadier Motantsi Makhele. In a separate incident, a 41-year-old complainant and manager of Mangaung Metro Solid Waste was driving his white BMW on MacKenzie Street in Heidedal on the way to work when he was stopped by a Silver Isuzu Bakkie. I really don't understand the logic behind destroying people's property, looting shops and cause stress to fellow citizens. How is this going to help? Protesting against the government or our own people? Get your shit together...#MangaungshutDown pic.twitter.com/63LZow20gE  Three men approached him and one pointed a firearm at him and instructed him to get out of the car. They drove away in his BMW, and after a few minutes the car was recovered, burnt, on MacKenzie Street. The people of Mangaung say enough is enough, second day of #MangaungshutDown pic.twitter.com/5FyRfkIP2R  Makhele said a case of hijacking has been registered for investigation. The situation is still tense and being closely monitored by the police.
