“MOBILISE in your communities and elect a candidate from your own area to contest the local government elections.” These were the words of One South Africa Movement leader Mmusi Maimane when he launched the organisation’s election plan in Joburg yesterday. The former DA leader said: “People are tired of political parties. They’re tired of how political parties work. “Councillors in their wards are just removed without them knowing or having a say. “The events that have unfolded over the past weeks within both the governing party and official opposition yet again confirm to South Africans what they know, the political system is broken, self-serving and in critical need of change.” ALSO READ: ‘BROKE’
SLAY QUEENS CAN’T PAY HOTEL BILL! Mamaine said it was time for residents to nominate their own leaders to represent them at municipal level instead of going on endless service delivery protests that often fall on deaf ears. He said his movement was working with individuals and organisations not linked to political parties to register for the elections. He said the upcoming local government elections would be a trial run for the national election in 2024. When asked if he’d be running for president as a representive of the independent candidates his movement was working with, he said he would. “With the local elections we are laying the groundwork. It’s vital that we explore a new, authentic way to give power back to communities,” said Maimane. “This model gives communities the power to take back control of their own destiny from political parties and install citizen-led governments in their municipalities.”
