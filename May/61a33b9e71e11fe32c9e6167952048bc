AFTER 65 years in the service of the late Zulu king as traditional prime minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi is ready to retire. Speaking at a media briefing at Durban Manor Hotel in eThekwini on Tuesday, 11 May, the longest-serving royal prime minister said he’s too old. The 92-year-old said Zulu King Misuzulu would appoint a replacement. But Buthelezi would continue serving his nation and chairing the royal council. Buthelezi, who’s also an IFP MP, said: “At my age, I expect it would be a good time for the king to appoint his own prime minister.” He said he didn’t know why there was anxiety about when he’d retire because he didn’t choose to be prime minister. “My cousin King Bhekuzulu appointed me to that position,” he said. “The late King Zwelithini didn’t appoint me but used me in that position. “I was angered that one journalist wrote an article saying they had discussions at hotels where the king said he didn’t appoint me. “During all that time I said to him he must appoint his own prime minister but he didn’t do that. I carried on with all the prime minister duties on his instruction.” Speaking about his position as an MP, Buthelezi said he was waiting for the Expropriation Bill to be passed into law but would otherwise already had retired.
