A LOT is often said about how big a man’s 4-5 is, or should be. We even to a large extent measure manhood by the size of a man’s 4-5. This, according to experts, has led to sexual issues such weak erections and low sex drive and esteem.

Well, according to a latest African study, that seems to not be the case. A new study out of Kenya found that husbands with larger 4-5s were more likely to be cheated on by their wives. In the study published this month in PLOS One journal, researchers interviewed 545 married couples in Kenya in order to better understand their relationship habits and, more specifically, to identify factors which contributed to women having extramarital affairs.

Then, if there were differences between the estimates, they either took the average of the two or went with the estimate from the partner who was less likely to lie. “Every one inch longer 4-5 increased the likelihood of women being involved in extramarital partnerships by almost one and a half times,” the researchers wrote. Women associated large 4-5s with pain and discomfort during sex, which precludes the enjoyment and sexual satisfaction that women are supposed to feel. According to the study, 6,2% of the 545 females had affairs during the six-month study. Other factors that increased the likelihood of women straying outside the marriage included domestic violence, being denied sex, or denied their preferred sexual position, being under the age of 25 and a lack of sexual satisfaction.
