FROM the outside it looks like a shack, but it’s actually a gate that leads to an RDP. Madala Alfred Mashaba’s house is so attractive people stop, stare and take pictures. The 67-year-old said he decided to do a makeover of his house three months ago. “At first I wanted to make a shop, but I didn’t have money for stock. So I decided to make a mkhukhu gate and decorate the fence with different things,” he said. Alfred said the entrance to his house had no meaning and was just for decoration. “I put three mannequins on top of the shack, which represent my family – me, my wife and son. It shows that this is a family home,” he said. “People love this house and I never thought they would. I didn’t even do this to get their attention, but I love how much it attracts people.” He said he wished to do more artistic things. “I’ve always been an artist, but I never had the opportunity to showcase my talent,” he said. Some residents said they couldn’t get used to the house, while others liked what he’d done to the place. Mafrie Kodisang (34) said Alfred had done something different and they were happy. “We love this house, especially the kids,” Mafrie told Daily Sun. “They always come and look at it like it’s a museum.” Another resident said some of them felt the house was too much. “We think the man is not normal,” he said. “This is too much and unnecessary, “But it’s his house and he can do whatever he likes with it.”
