TS GALAXY coach Owen Da Gama has applauded youngsters for stepping up when given a chance. On Sunday, Masilakhe Phohlongo and Tshegofatso Nyama displayed a five-star performance when The Rockets defeated Orlando Pirates 1-0 at Mbombela Stadium, Nelspruit. Phohlongo scored the only goal of the match in the third minute, which saw his coach singing his praises. "We've had a lot of injuries, we've had a lot of situations where we were forced to make changes, but it's a blessing in disguise because you know the youngsters have come through," said Owen. Galaxy were without Bevan Fransman, Karabo Tshepe and McBeth Mahlangu who are all injured. The club had also released players such as Reneilwe Letsholonyane, Myer Bevan, Felix Badenhorst, Mbulelo Wambi and Xolani Maholo early this month. "To see Phohlongo and (Tshegofatso) Nyama playing the way they did, it is just a delight for me to see youngsters coming through, and that is what I thrive for,‚Äù he added. "I like youngsters to come through, and I always say with Pirates, you have to give them credit, they are a fantastic team, with very good coach (Josef Zinnbauer), but I believe this is where stars are created, stars are born when you play against Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns. Da Gama added: "And I'm very happy that the boys have the confidence to be able to come out, I mean Phohlongo, it's his second goal against Pirates this season, in his debut game he scored against them, and he scored again today (Sunday)." The three points see Galaxy sneak into the top eight with 35 points, gathered from 28 outings. In the remaining two games, The Kwa-Ndebele based club will be hoping to cement their place in the top eight. On Wednesday, they will face Stellenbosch FC at Parow Park (5pm), and the last game of the season will be against struggling Chiefs at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday (3pm).
