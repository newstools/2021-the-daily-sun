BRITISH & Irish Lions Tour sponsors Castle Lager says that not only is the brand ready to host a world-class sporting event, but they couldn’t be happier to bring this renowned tour to Mzansi fans once again.  “We are extremely fortunate that we are able to support the Tour as it hits our country. It is our pride as the nation’s favourite beer to share in this joyous occasion where the power of sports will once again be on full display,” said Castle Lager Brand Director, Kudzi Mathabire. And it is this very power that sport holds, its insatiable ability to bring South Africans together time after time, that inspired Castle Lager to put its weight behind the Tour. The brand says their hope is to create magical moments of unity that transcend the sport itself and lines us up in support of the Boks and the Lions despite our differences. “Our love for rugby runs deep through our veins, as does our passion for our nation, it is #InOurBlood. So, let’s come together, the best way we know how, by sharing a Castle and enjoying some rugby,” Mathabire continued. Through a partnership with the South African National Blood Service, Castle Lager is encouraging South Africans to channel their love and passion for rugby and donate blood to help save lives. They will be creating a limited-edition rugby jersey to mark the campaign. The SANBS will oversee the donations process and garner blood donations of the Springboks and the nation at large. To take up the cause to become a blood donor, visit sanbs.org.za or call their contact centre on 0800 119 031 for more information. Fans can get a hold of the jersey by visiting the brand’s social media page: @CastleLagerSA on Twitter and Facebook.
