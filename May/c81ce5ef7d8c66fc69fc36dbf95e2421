DAYLIN Mitchell was appointed Western Cape MEC for Transport and Public Works on Monday, 24 May, replacing Bonginkosi Madikizela, who resigned following allegations that he lied about his qualifications. Madikizela was also replaced from the position of the provincial leader last week. Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has appointed Mitchell, who was the chairman of the standing committee on transport and public works in the provincial parliament. He said the 35-year-old is suitable for the position. “I know Daylin to be a hard working representative who is committed to making the Western Cape a better place for all who live in it. I am confident he will continue to serve the people of this province with distinction in this important position. As the chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport and Public Works, he’s already familiar with the challenges and opportunities that exist in this portfolio, and I expect him to hit the ground running,” said Winde. Accepting his new role, Mitchell said it was his honour to be a member of a provincial cabinet and he will do everything to ensure he delivers the services. “It is my goal to ensure that the Department of Transport and Public Works plays an important role in delivering the strategic objectives of this provincial administration, namely, creating a safe province, where residents have jobs and live with dignity,” he said. Meanwhile, Albert Fritz was elected interim leader last week, effectively replacing Madikizela from the provincial leadership position. Fritz will lead the party in the province until DA’s provincial conference. Madikizela resigned from all his positions last month after a furore over his educational qualifications. His bio stated that he has a Bachelor of Commerce in Human Resources when in fact he did not complete it.
