THE Guptas made more than R15 billion from irregular contracts with state-owned enterprises. This was what Paul Holden of Shadow World Investigations told the Zondo Commission yesterday while testifying on money laundered over the years. The research firm, based in London in England, looked at the bank statements of players involved. Holden estimated that the actual amount of taxpayers’ money lost to state capture was just under R50 billion. His testimony was based on his report on the flow of funds and sometimes complex payment methods and schemes that mainly benefitted the Guptas. Among the examples he gave of how money was laundered was the R12 million the Free State agriculture department paid to a company called Tshebo. A week later, Tshebo paid R9 million to Innova, which was managed by Gupta lieutenant Salim Essa. Holden presented tables detailing how much each state entity paid to Gupta companies directly or indirectly. He said on 29 April 2016, a Gupta-linked company called Cutting Edge submitted an unsolicited proposal to Eskom to provide data management and cleaning services. He said on 9 May 2016, the contract was concluded and an amount of just over R71 million was paid for these services. “No competitive bidding process took place in relation to the contract. “The full contract price of R71 166 780 was paid by Eskom to Cutting Edge on 16 May 2016,” said Holden.
