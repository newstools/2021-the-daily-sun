CHIPPA United coach Vladislav Heric wants to make the Eastern Cape province proud by clinching the Nedbank Cup. The Chilli Boys are in their first ever cup final. They face Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), who are also in their first final since the club bought the franchise of Bidvest Wits at the end of last season. The battle of the two ambitious sides is billed for Saturday at Free State Stadium (6pm). Eastern Cape football fanatics will embrace the moment if the Chilli Boys win the Ke Yona Cup. The last time the province had a team that won a domestic competition in the PSL was in 1996 when Umtata Bush Bucks won the Coca-Cola Cup, which is now known as Telkom Knockout. Heric, who had an unsuccessful stint at TTM at the beginning of the season, said this is the biggest weekend in his career coaching in the PSL. “It’s the biggest week I’ve had (as a coach). For me personally, it would mean a lot to win this cup. “If you work 16 years in a country and did not lift a trophy … it’s not good. So, it’s a great opportunity for me to win something,” Heric said during a virtual press conference yesterday. “The fact that I worked for TTM and we ended up in arbitration, is not good for both sides. But there is nothing between me and the club because there is a new owner and he has done nothing to me. But I will go all out to win this game and beat them. I will do my job as best as I can.” The well-travelled Heric, who recently returned to Chippa for his third stint, revealed he is there for a short-term period, and his mandate is to win the cup and save the club from being relegated. Heric said: “I have a short-term agreement with the chairman. We just said I would be here until the right moment. My mandate is to win the cup and save the club. The chairman has a good heart. “I’ve been cross at him several times before because he fired me (twice) without a reason. He said he doesn’t know why he fired me, but I have no issues with him.”
