Actress Thandy Matlaila has entered a new space by starring in SABC2’s new Afrikaans telenovela, Die Sentrum. Previously known for her roles in dramas including Tshisa, The Queen and Gold Diggers, Thandy will now play Bapsi Mahola on the Cape Town-based drama. Die Sentrum, which has been on air for over a month, took over 7de Laan’s time slot on Thursdays and Fridays. The actress told SunBuzz about her new character. “The story is centred around a call centre. My little sister Hle, played by Esihle Mkosana, works at the centre,” she said. “Bapsi had to raise her after they lost their mother. Now that Hle is old, Bapsi wants her to pay her back. “Thinking that Hle is obligated to take care of her, she takes black tax to another level. She’s more than capable of getting a job but doesn’t want to because she wants Hle to take care of her.” ALSO READ |OPRAH PRAISES THUSO MBEDU The actress said people aren’t happy that Die Sentrum took over the 7de Laan time slot, but she urged them to give it a chance as they might love it. “Viewers have been watching us like a hawk, trying to see if we’ll live up to 7de Laan. But in reality, Die Sentrum is different from 7de Laan and people need to understand that. We’re dealing with life issues that people haven’t seen on SA television,” said Thandy. “The show is based at a crisis call centre and workers have to deal with other people’s crises while they have theirs to deal with. It’s deep, deals with serious issues and it’s relatable.” The star also has two new gigs coming up. “I’m doing some exciting things in the fitness space. I’ve always been passionate about fitness, so I’m doing online coaching for a fitness brand. “I also starred on Blood Psalms, which I know is highly anticipated. It might come out on the second half of this year.” Catch Die Sentrum on SABC2 on Thursdays and Fridays at 6pm.
