President Cyril Ramaphosa has congratulated Pitso Mosimane on leading the continent’s top football club, Al Ahly, to victory in the African Super Cup on Friday. Al Ahly’s win over Renaissance of Morocco earned the former Mamelodi Sundowns manager his fourth title with Al Ahly since joining the club six months ago. “Pitso Mosimane is an outstanding flag-bearer for our country and for football," Ramaphosa said. “His outstanding performance and that of his club shows what is possible when talent moves freely around our continent to unite people from diverse backgrounds and national origin and inspire them to achieve extraordinary things.”
