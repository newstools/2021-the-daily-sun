THE wife of late former rugby player Lindani Myeni (29) described him as a loving, caring and truthful man. Lindsay Myeni was speaking at his funeral service at Esikhawini College, northern KZN, on Saturday, 8 May. She said the truth must be spoken, no matter how hard it may be. Myeni was shot and killed last month by Honolulu cops in Hawaii in the US. With the KZN government’s intervention, his body was brought to Mzansi last Saturday. Lindsay said: “On the day he passed away he told me he saw six or seven red circles. He said those were signs his ancestors were embracing him. We had planned to die together at the age of 99. But he has left me so soon. I think the reason he left now is that he wants the truth to be spoken.”    She said Myeni wanted people to be equal. “Hence today white and black people are sitting together. “I believe he’s okay. His spirit is with us,” she said. His aunt, Nonhlanhla Myeni said he was a hyper active child when growing up. “He grew up and got into sport. He was disciplined, responsible, mature and didn’t take nonsense. He loved us as his family and always contacted us,” she said. She said Myeni’s wife must never forget they’ll always be family. Lindsay’s brother Justine Anderson said he was his sister’s protector until she married Myeni.   He said it hurts this sister’s protector is no more. Speaking on behalf of KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala, Community Safety MEC Peggy Nkonyeni said Myeni was a victim of a racism war. Nkonyeni said they’re happy the wish of Myeni’s wife and family to have him buried at home was fulfilled. “Myeni didn’t only go to the US as a sportsman but went there as a worker to ply his trade in a nation that promises big dreams in appearance but in essence has racial categories for those dreams,” she said. She said they wouldn’t to rest until those who killed him are brought to book. Myeni also leaves behind his two children Nsizwa and Nandi.
