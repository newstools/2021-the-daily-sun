If there is one coach who knows how to celebrate a trophy victory, then it must be Dylan Kerr. The Englishman Tshakhuma FC coach bombarded the social media pages with pictures of himself, flanked by the Nedbank Cup trophy. He went to the extreme and went to bed with it, not sure if that is allowed by the sponsors, but this is what the excited went about. "Guess who I'm sleeping with tonight?" he wrote on his Twitter handle with the Nedbank Cup trophy neatly placed inside blanked, with a hotel bed linen and nicely placed on the frilled standard pillow. And he couldn't help himself but pose with whoever he came across, including former Bafana Bafana coach, Molefi Ntseki.
