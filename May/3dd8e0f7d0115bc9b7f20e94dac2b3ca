ACTOR Bhekinkosi Mpofu never thought one day he would be a movie star. He said although he loved acting, it was never his main dream. But now he is a movie star and gives his sexy, muscular body the credit. Bhekinkosi plays the lead character of a cop named Nkosi on the movie titled Alleyway, which is expected to be released in June on Amazon. He plays along Luthuli Dlamini and Jack Devnarain. He said landing the role was just a miracle. It all started when he met a producer at a car service station.

He told me he was looking for a place to shoot his movie. He also told me he liked my body and it could fit well for a leading character of his movie. We exchanged numbers and the rest is history,” said Bheki. Bheki, who’s originally from Zimbabwe but based in Joburg, said his character has taught him a lot about corruption in government. “This cop, Nkosi, discovered corruption in government and he was framed which led to his arrest. He spent five in jail. When he came out, he made sure he comes for those who framed him,” said Bhekinkosi. He said that playing in the thriller helped him realise his talent for acting. “I’m not going back now. I’ve realised how much talent I have and I’m going to use it to get more TV roles,” said Bhekinkosi. Alleyway was written, produced and directed by Henry Charly. It was premiered at One People International Film Festival that was held in Cape Town from 27 April to 1 May.
