DIOGO Peral may not be a familiar name in local football. But there can be no perfect opportunity for him to audition for the job and perhaps announce himself on the bigger stage than with a good run as interim coach of Cape Town City. Peral has been thrust into the hot-seat at the Citizens after head coach Jan Olde Riekerink was placed on special leave last week. Coming from the MultiChoice Diski Challenge Rewired side, Diogo has worked closely with Riekerink. But he will have his chance to guide City when they face Bloemfontein Celtic in their DStv Premiership at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Wednesday afternoon (3pm). The Citizens are neither in danger of missing out on the top-eight spot nor have relegation worries. But a poor run of results shows they could be pushing for a top-three finish if it weren’t for their inconsistent form. They won three of their last five matches, but it appears the 5-1 drubbing at the hands of AmaZulu was enough for John Comitis to push the panic buttons. Siwelele are in a far precarious position, with one win in their last seven matches, and three points away from the relegation zone. In fact, they could drop further down, should they fail to win at home, given the narrow point gap between them and Stellenbosch, Maritzburg United, TTM and Chippa United. Their last win came against TS Galaxy over a month ago. Yet they could still leapfrog the floundering Kaizer Chiefs and edge closer to the top-eight finish. John Maduka knows his future could be depending on the next two matches, although he is not overly unconcerned. “Whatever happens in the future is part of life. I didn’t know that one day I will be sitting here, talking to you as a Celtic coach. “As I said, as a coach, you don’t want to lose games.”
