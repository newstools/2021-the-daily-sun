THE Zulu nation’s late regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, has been granted a provincial state funeral for her contribution in building the nation and KZN’s society. She died on Thursday, 29 April after an illness. She will be buried at her royal palace at KwaKhangelamankengane, Nongoma at dawn on Thursday. Her memorial service will be held on Friday at KwaKhangelamankengane and will be presided over by the Seventh Day Adventist Church to which she belonged. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala, who submitted the state funeral request for the queen to the president, confirmed that she has been granted one. “She nurtured young girls and made sure she was a role model to them. I can confirm that we now have an agreement with the national government about her provincial funeral. “Queen Mantfombi was also a bridge that links us as South Africa to eSwatini, where she was born and raised,” he said. Zikalala said as the KZN government, they’d continue supporting the Zulu royal family despite their internal squabbles. He said it pains him to see issues of the royal family being discussed in a manner in which it’s happening, where they will be exchanging words in public among people who have a responsibility to sit together and talk. . “Our call and our plea is to respect Her Majesty the Queen and His Majesty, the King. All of us will confirm that his majesty was emphatic in the approach of solving problems through discussions.” Zikalala pleaded with the royal house to sit down together to discuss their issues internally and approach them if they need help.
