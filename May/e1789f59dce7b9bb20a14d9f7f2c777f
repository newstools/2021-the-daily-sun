A 32-YEAR-OLD police constable stationed at Phuthaditjhaba Police Station in the Free State was arrested on 25 April and briefly appeared in court. He allegedly moered community patrollers with a spade. According to victims Sello Mokoena (63) and Letlala Letsheleha (58), both from Mphatlalatsane Village in QwaQwa, they were attacked after the patrollers told station commander Brigadier Moses Mohloare during a community meeting that Constable Takatso Moloi sells drugs in their village. Speaking to Daily Sun, Sello said the officer and two boys attacked them. “They were armed with pangas, sticks and a garden spade. They attacked us violently. I noticed Constable Moloi armed with a spade. “He broke my right hand and hit ntate Letlala in the eye. We’re injured and, unfortunately, we’re no longer going to protect our people from criminals and drug dealers.” Letlala said: “We maintained order in our village. We fought against any form of criminality. “Unfortunately, we were attacked by the person who’s supposed to protect us. We hope justice will prevail.” One of the patrollers, who asked not to be named, said: “We sent different people to go to the officer’s house to buy weed and an unknown pill. Those people came back with them. This means he’s a drug dealer,” he said. The suspects appeared in the Makwane Magistrates Court on Friday, 30 April. Free State police spokesman Brigadier Motansi Makhele said Moloi, along with two co-accused aged 24 and 26, were arrested and detained for assault. They were remanded in custody until 10 May for a formal bail application.
