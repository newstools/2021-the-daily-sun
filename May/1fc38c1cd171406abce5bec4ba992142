UKHOZI FM producer Ayanda Melansi has opened a criminal case against maskandi artist, Sgwebo Sentambo. This after a video clip did the rounds on social media, where Sgwebo was seen calling Ayanda names and insulting her. All this because he was angry over her Facebook post. Sgwebo was responding to Ayanda’s post where she revealed she’d named her dogs after maskandi artists. “I had five dogs. Their names were Mfaz’omnyama, Mgqumeni, Nyonemhlophe, Ntencane and Sgwebo Sentambo. I sold two dogs, Mgqumeni and Sgwebo, and I am now left with three,” she wrote. The post angered Sgwebo so much that he and his manager Khumbulani “Mabalengwe” Ntombela contacted the SABC to lodge a complaint against her.

I am a happy gogo this morning.” Her post had maskandi organisations and fans rallying behind Sgwebo. Bambisanani Foundation founder Phiwokuhle Bantukabalingani Bhengu said: “We’re not happy with Ayanda’s utterances. Her latest post that her dogs can now bark is full of sly innuendo and we believe she’s still insulting artists. “We thought she wanted peace and had realised her mistake when she apologised, but we can see that the apology was not honest. We’re fully behind Sgwebo and want justice for degrading our artists.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of crimen injuria was opened at Durban Central cop shop. “The complainant allegedly saw a video on social media that insulted her. The matter is still under investigation,” she said.
