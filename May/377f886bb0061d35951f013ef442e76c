ERIC Tinkler has expressed his delight at making a return to his former club Cape Town City. The 50-year-old was reappointed to replace Dutchman Jan Olde Riekerink who was shown the door last week. Riekerink had been placed under administrative leave two weeks prior. Tinkler returns to an environment he knows very well having been in charge at the club in their first season in the PSL. He led the newly-formed club to third place in the league and the Telkom Knockout trophy before leaving for SuperSport United. Tinkler, who signed a four-year contract with the Citizens, is hoping that his second spell is even more successful. “Obviously, I’m really excited to be back at the club,” said Tinkler. “I had a very successful season back in 2016 with Cape Town City and a lot of fond memories. So, to be able to come back here and hopefully replicate what we achieved in 2016 and improve on that will be the main target. What I have seen with this club is that it has not really achieved much after what it achieved with me and Benni McCarthy. We have to change that. “We need to change the mentality of the players who come to the club, they need to understand that this club is no longer a stepping stone to something bigger or better. We are a club that wants to win things and the players that come here need to show that. I have come back here because I want to win things. I think this club has all the elements required to achieve that.”
