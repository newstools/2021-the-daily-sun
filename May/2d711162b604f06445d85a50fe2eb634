IT’S been almost a year since Tshegofatso Pule was murdered and it seems her family might finally get the justice they’ve been praying for. Despite his many attempts to convince the court he is innocent, Ntuthuko Shoba’s second attempt to get bail was denied. The alleged mastermind in the murder of eight-months-pregnant Pule appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court on Friday, 7 May, where he had presented new evidence in order to be granted bail. The former JSE employee is facing a charge of premeditated murder. This comes after accused number 1, Muzikayise Malephane, pleaded guilty to killing 28-year-old Pule. Malephane entered into a plea bargain with the state, agreeing he would turn state witness against Shoba in February. Malephane alleged he was hired by Shoba to kill Pule and make it look like a suicide for a fee of R70 000. Pule was found hanging from a tree by a passerby in Durban Deep, Roodepoort, last year June. She had been missing from home for four days.
