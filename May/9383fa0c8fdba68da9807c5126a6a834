WITH the rising number of new Covid-19 cases, citizens have called on government to react quickly by imposing stricter regulations before things get worse. This after the National Institute for Communicable Diseases confirmed that four of the people who travelled from India tested positive for the new variant B.1.617.2. Two cases were from Gauteng and two from KZN. The institute said B.1.617.2 was highlighted as a variant of interest by the World Health Organisation, and one of multiple variants in India. Acting executive director Prof Adrian Puren said all cases were isolated and managed according to Covid-19 guidelines, and that contact tracing had been performed to limit the spread of this variant. But that didn’t stop people from calling for swift reaction as Mzansi might head for a third wave. Comfort Mashabela (26) from Mamelodi, east of Tshwane, said government should protect them as it looked as if the third wave would be deadlier. “We can even go back to level 5 for a few weeks to give government a chance to contain it,” he said. Comfort understood that people’s jobs were already on the line, but lives should be more important.  “Rather we lose jobs because they can be replaced,” he said. Karabo Shadung (25) said government was caught between a rock and hard place. He said whatever it chose to do would have an impact on everyone, but the bottom line was their lives were more important. “As much as we want the freedom to make a living, we can’t turn a blind eye to the danger at our doorstep. Government needs to be bold and act now before it’s too late.” Abraham Sebola (50) from Mamelodi said government was to blame for the new variant and should have closed ports of entry. “We’ve been adhering to the rules, but they fail to stop those who choose to travel.”
