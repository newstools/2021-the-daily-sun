PEOPLE have a love-hate relationship with booze. But those who are head over heels in love with alcohol showed the lengths they would be prepared to go to for a sip of their favourite beer. A study that was recently released suggests that drinking booze is “harmful to the brain”. It said there is no safe amount of drinking alcohol for the brain, even with “moderate” drinking the brain will be badly affected. The study suggests that the more booze you drink, the worse off your brain is. The British study is still to be peer-reviewed and suggests that the more alcohol consumed, the lower the brain volume. “There’s no threshold of drinking for harm, any alcohol is bad. Pretty much the whole brain seems to be affected, not just specific areas as previously thought,” said the lead author, Anya Topiwala, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Oxford. Colin Angus, a senior research fellow from the alcohol research group at the University of Sheffield, said in the grand scheme of things, these effects appear small. Although, it’s hard to compare them against the impact of alcohol on other health outcomes, such as increased risks of cancer, without further research to understand how the association between alcohol and brain health feeds through into more tangible outcomes, such as dementia or Alzheimer’s. The SunTeam asked readers if they were willing to stop drinking booze and this is what they said on Facebook.
