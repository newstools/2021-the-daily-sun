KAIZER Chiefs might be taking a massive advantage into their Caf Champions League second-leg encounter with Simba SC, but they have no intentions of resting on their laurels. Instead, Amakhosi will be going for the kill and looking to wrap up qualification for the semi-finals of Africa premier club competition when they face Tanzanian giants at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium, in Dar es Salaam on Saturday (3pm). Gavin Hunt’s charges will be looking to replicate their performance from the first leg at home, which saw them thump Simba 4-0 and take a giant step towards reaching the last four of the competition for the first time. The Glamour Boys, despite their struggles domestically, have been a different beast in continental football, breaking club records on their way to the quarter-finals. Chiefs youngster Happy Mashiane remains wary of the threat posed by Wekundu wa Msimbazi, as Simba are affectionately known, but insist that his side have what it takes to get the job done. Mashiane wants Amakhosi to ride their wave of momentum in the Champions League and go all the way to the final. ‘We want to go to the final,” said Mashiane. “There is no turning back now. After reaching this stage of the competition, we might as well just go all the way. “We have already broken some records to get to where we are now, so we have to keep going. “But it won’t be easy we know. We have done our business at home, but we need to ensure that we go there and kill the tie as a contest. “But we know that those guys (Simba) can play. “We must not get carried away and take things for granted.” Chiefs striker Samir Nurkovic, who scored a brace in the first leg against Simba at home, wants to see the same application from his side in the second leg. “It’s an amazing feeling to be playing well again,” Nurkovic said. “The Amakhosi family already knows what I can do and that’s why they call me Kokota Piano. “I always try my best to make them happy. ”
