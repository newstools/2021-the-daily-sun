The appointment of Steve Komphela as senior coach at Mamelodi Sundowns came as a surprise to many but was at the request of co-coach Manqoba Mnggithi, who believed they needed his know-how and vibrant personality in the change-room. Komphela gave up his position as head coach at Lamontville Golden Arrows to move to Chloorkop, acknowledging that he would have to work under co-coaches Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena. That is not to say he does not have influence on every sphere of the side, but it is as a ‘back-seat driver’ rather than his usual position at the steering wheel. Mngqithi knows his own understated personality does not necessarily lend him to being a father-figure in the team, a role not suited to the much younger Mokwena either, who can reel off hours of coaching theory but is not a shoulder to cry on for players. Enter Komphela, who is respected, has years in the game and enjoys interacting with players on a personal level. He was, in many ways, the piece that completed the coaching puzzle following the exit of Pitso Mosimane to Al Ahly. This is a first league title winners’ medal for Komphela as part of a coaching team. In fact, a first major piece of silverware in his career. Komphela has been head coach for almost 400 matches in South Africa’s top-flight for eight different clubs, with a couple of fourth-placed finishes (Free State Stars, 2008-09 and Kaizer Chiefs, 2016-17) his best showing. His first season, in 2003-04, saw him have two spells at Manning Rangers either side of a stint at Dynamos in what a slightly chaotic entrance for him. He went away to coach the junior national set-up after that, but returned to the DStv Premiership in 2008-09 with Free State Stars, and has featured in every season since. It has largely been a story of solidity, he has finished in the top half in six of his 11 completed seasons since then, with just a single poor campaign at Platinum Stars (they finished 14th in 2009-10) his only flirtation with relegation. His chance to lead one of the so-called Bid Three came with a move to Kaizer Chiefs in the 2015-16 season but he took over an aging squad that also suffered from a number of players leaving and his fifth and fourth-placed finishes were deemed failures. He left Naturena three games before the end of the 2017-18 campaign after fan violence at the Nedbank Cup semifinal defeat to Free State Stars in Durban. He then spent half a season each at Bloemfontein Celtic and Lamontville Golden Arrows, before a full campaign with the latter in 2019-20 that would prove his last, for now, as a head coach.
