PSG superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar Jr’s rapport on the pitch is a result of their relationship off it. The pair seem to get along well off the pitch, as their pranks on each other would suggest. Neymar is known to be the big prankster in the PSG dressing room but he was given a taste of his own medicine by Mbappe. In a video uploaded to his Instagram story, the France forward can be seen dipping what seems to be a towel or sweatshirt in a bath full of water. He then sneaks through a room at the Camp des Loges training center and threw it on Neymar’s face. And being a prankster of note himself, Neymar could not help but see the funny side to the hilarious prank.
