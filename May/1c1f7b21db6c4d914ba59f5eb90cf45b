CONTROVERSIAL hip-hop artists Mzayifani “IFani” Boltina and Big Xhosa have once again set tongues wagging. This follows the title of their song iKuku, a Xhosa word for vagina. On Twitter, IFani wrote: “Big Xhosa feat IFani - Iku’kendala. (Droppin soon, sooner, msunest).” But the tweeps were not impressed, as they felt he was trying too hard to make a comeback. Velaphi wrote: “Now you are trying to be relevant with an up-and-coming artist.” Behind A Lense wrote: “Give it up for Big Xhosa for dragging IFani back.” Tshepiso said: “Looks like you wanna be hated sien.” ALSO READ | THANDY HERE FOR BLACK TAX! According to Big Xhosa, the song was already out and to those criticising the track, he said: “I don’t suffer from the ‘bazothini abantu’ sickness. I’m doing what I love with my life, my freedom. I’m not harming nobody, I’m just doing me. Just do you with your life nawe. New song iKuku dropping tonight with a video.” In another tweet, he said: “Haven’t you guys had enough of abo “my nigga, me and all my niggas, I do this for my dawgs” on these lyrics of these SA rappers? Let me be Big Xhosa on peace and say “umsunu wenu nonke” on a song. Let me express my art the way I see fit. Love ya’ll.” Not everyone was offended by the song title, with a handful of fans excited about it. Qiniso Magubane said: “Uqale ngamasende, and now you’re gonna drop iKuku. After this izinqa keep on blessing us with hits Big Xhosa.” Joe Sam also encouraged him, saying he must not doubt himself as he was shaking up the SA hip-hop industry. “Ndicela ungazithandabuzi, no one and I mean no one has ever had the guts to shake SA hip-hop like you do, and for that ndikuthulela umnqwazi.” Big Xhosa feat. iFani - ikuk'endala????????(Droppin soon, sooner, msunest)
