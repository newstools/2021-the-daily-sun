THE section of the Kliprivier that flows through Soweto is clean again, thanks to mkhulu Romeo Malepe and his crew. Sangoma Romeo has been vocal about the importance of cleanliness, especially when it comes to izangoma, and he’s practising what he’s preaching. He told Daily Sun he’d been bashed by other izangoma for wanting to keep rivers clean, but the comments won’t stop him. He said he didn’t like that they preach cleanliness but contradict themselves when it comes to rivers. On 25 May, Daily Sun published a story about mkhulu Romeo complaining about izangoma leaving rivers dirty. “Some have come for me on social media.  “They think I was saying they should take back what they washed away and that’s not the case,” said Romeo. He plans to do this every day.  “If I can get sponsorship we’ll go really far,” he said, adding that they needed paint, food and transport,” he said “Seeing the place clean was amazing. I realised we could host the Sangoma Festival under a bridge. “I was attacked countless times but I won’t stop.” But some fully supported him. Nomusa Twala said it broke her heart that people left rubbish in the river. Ras Pule said: “May the divine heavenly forces eternally shower you with blessings and everyone else who came to the party to resuscitate the environment.”
