A 32-year-old Malawian man has chopped off his own testicles in Dedza township. According to Malawi24, the man was admitted to Dedza District Hospital where he was referred to after he was initially taken to Chikuse Health Centre in the district. The man is reportedly mentally unstable and his guardians have told the Malawian local media he has a history of addiction to Indian Hemp. Mental health advocate Herbert Chawinga told the publication there is little action being taken in as far as mental health issues are concerned. ALSO READ: MAMAZALA WOKE MY 4-5! He noted that in the case of the man, the hospital is now treating much of the physical effect which could have been avoided had the psychological cause been treated. “What those who knew that this man had addiction problems should have done was to take him to any hospital where he could have been assessed, put him through some addiction recovery rehab programmes and determine further as to whether he has to be treated for possible Drug Induced Psychotic Disorder.” He said if Dedza Hospital doesn’t have the capacity, they should refer him either to the nearby St John of God Addiction Recovery Centre in Lilongwe or Zomba Mental Hospital, depending on the assessment results. “But look what happens, they watch him hang around dangerously until he hurts himself really badly and that’s when they rush him to hospital.”
