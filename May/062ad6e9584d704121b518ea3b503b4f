ON SATURDAY 8 May, Ancestors Day was officially launched. Contralesa was joined by various representatives of traditional and cultural organisations to celebrate the new day of commemoration at Mathibela Royal Palace in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. Among the organisations that sent representatives were the National Heritage Council, the CRL Rights Commission and the National House of Traditional Leaders. Contralesa general secretary Zolani Mkiva said: “We identified a gap in the way the calendar is structured. “There isn’t a single day to honour our ancestors. We are here because of those who came before us.” Mkiva said they were preparing a petition to submit to the government, so the day could be announced in the official gazette. “This is not a day of chilling and having a braai, but to collectively honour our ancestors as we have been doing individually throughout the year,” he said. But not everyone was happy about it. The ACDP took to social media to call on Christians to reject the day and only to pray to God. Mkiva said the statement was irresponsible and childish. “Before European colonisation, we had African spirituality,” he said. SunReaders expressed support for the day. Solly Sebata (51) said: “We, as black Africans, believe in ancestors. Ancestors are people we once lived with, some of whom are our late parents, relatives and friends.  “They give us their blessings and protection.” Sibusiso Shiba (45) said: “We definitely need a day to honour and celebrate our ancestors.”  Zanemvula Delihlazo (36) said: “It’s our culture to believe in ancestors for blessings.”  Elliot Twala (41) said: “God is alive and we still believe in Him, but that doesn’t mean we should forget about our ancestors.”
