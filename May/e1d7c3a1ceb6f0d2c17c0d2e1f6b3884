WHAT started as a peaceful protest ended up becoming a day-long clash between residents and cops. Residents of Rietvallei in Kagiso, west of Joburg, threw stones at the police, who fought back with rubber bullets and tear gas on Monday, 24 May. At one point, the police nyala chased the crowd, while women stood ululating and men whistled on the sidelines . When the vehicle stopped, the residents used corrugated iron as shields against the rubber bullets, so they could get close enough to throw stones and bottles at cops. The angry residents were trying to invade a piece of land. They said they had tried getting what they needed peacefully but it never worked. Madala Gadela (47) said: “We don’t mind doing this over and over again as long as we get the answer we want. Negotiations failed and we’ve decided to use force.” Community leader Thembani Sibanyoni said they wanted permission to occupy the land. “We want to develop our area. If given permission, we will use the land as a business area.” Mogale City public safety MMC Anna Setswalo-Moja went to the scene to listen to residents and accept their memorandum of grievances. She said there were plans to develop the land and pleaded with residents to be patient. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said public order police tried to control the situation and move the protesters away from the busy main road. “The MMC came to listen to them. We don’t understand why they continued with the protest after that,” he said. Makhubele said six people were arrested and would appear in Kagiso Magistrates Court on charges of public violence.
