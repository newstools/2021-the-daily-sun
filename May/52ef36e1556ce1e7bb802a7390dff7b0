The SA Football Association (Safa) is set to lose their official, Sudesh Singh, who is wanted in Egypt to form part of one of the world’s top academies, Right to Dream. Singh is a member of Safa technical committee that headhunted the new Bafana Bafana coach Hugo Broos. But the Safa’s position is not a permanent job, according to SunSport sources. That’s why he has been enticed to be part of this big academy in Egypt and is leaving the country within the next coming days. Sudesh, who is passionate about the development of football and one of many coaches who learned so much under the late Ted Dumitru, is extremely excited about this new opportunity. “It’s an interesting opportunity abroad,” said Sudesh.“Right of Dream is the biggest academy in Africa and one of the best in the world. “They are doing something massive. I have also told the Safa president Danny Jordaan and the CEO Tebogo Motlanthe about the offer.” The Right To Dream is the global opportunity creating an ecosystem of football academies, professional football clubs and partnering colleges and universities, founded by visionary British social entrepreneur, Tom Vernon. Vernon, the CEO of Right To Dream Group, said: “For 20 years Right To Dream has been using football as a vehicle for social change, bringing life-changing opportunities through sport and education for children and their communities. “This partnership helps Right To Dream accelerate global expansion plans to provide more opportunities for more children around the world, continuing to put people and purpose at the centre of football.”
