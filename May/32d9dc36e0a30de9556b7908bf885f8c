HE WAS only 24 when he got a job and a bright future lay ahead of him. But he was suddenly struck by a disease. He had an operation and survived. However, just as Thulani Mbatha was recovering, he was involved in a crash when the bus he was travelling in hit a concrete wall. Thulani said he was struck by yet another disease, when doctors detected meningitis. But this time, he couldn’t walk. The 30-year-old from Soweto was also dumped by his girlfriend, who told him he was too much for her. “I believe I’m cursed. I appeal for prayers and any spiritual healing. I pray for good health. I’m tired of being sick. I just want to get back on my feet and stop depending on other people,” he said. Thulani said he has had about seven operations. He first went under the knife in 2014 to remove kidney stones. He said when he was involved in the bus accident in 2017, his neck became stiff and doctors told him he’d be okay. In 2018, he woke up to find that his feet were numb and he was admitted to hospital. A lumber puncture procedure was conducted on his spine and meningitis was detected. Thulani now uses crutches and a wheelchair to get around. “There was a time I thought I needed to thwasa as I thought amadlozi were punishing me. “I consulted a sangoma who told me I don’t have a gift. I don’t know what’s going on. I need help and prayers,” he said. Dr Micheal Nkoane said a lumber puncture is performed on the lower back to remove a cerebrospinal fluid sample to diagnose or treat a condition. He said meningitis may also be picked up during the test.
