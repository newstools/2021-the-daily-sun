THE idea of South African women being given the option of legally having two husbands has divided Mzansi. Men are against it, while women are pro. Polyandry means that like men, women may have as many spouses as they want. It means a woman can take more than one husband, which may soon be legalised. On Generations, one of Mzansi’s favourite soapies, there was once a relationship when Karabo Moroka was married to Tau Mogale while having an affair with Zola Radebe. It came to a point when Karabo wanted to have Zola as her second husband and all hell broke loose. At that point, Tau wanted things to be made clear of how they were going share time with their wife and their living arrangements. “There are seven days in a week. It’s not like we can split it evenly. There are many things to consider – weekends, long weekends, anniversaries, Christmas,” he said on the soapie. He said they could do shifts of three and four days and he made it clear that when one of the husbands was with Karabo, the other one should not call unless it was an emergency. In real life it seems only fair that what’s legal for men should be legal for other sexes.  A Green Paper published by Home Affairs last week is set to regulate all marriages in the country. One of the problems the Green Paper must deal with is discrimination against same-sex couples. The department has hosted country-wide ministerial conversations with groups, including religious leaders, the Khoisan and gender activists. Marriage laws in Mzansi are based on Christian traditions and customary marriage, but Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Rastafarian marriages are not recognised. The Recognition of Customary Marriages Act doesn’t make provision for polygamous marriage with non-citizens. One the questions raised was about the double standards of religious values which support polygamous marriages but not polyandrous marriages.
