Allow people to vote for the party of their choice. If you don’t want to vote for a particular political party, it’s your right not to vote for it. The Bill of Rights grants all citizens, aged 18 and older, the right to vote for the party of their choice. There’s no need to hate other people’s choices. We had a few of these disturbing behaviours during the by-elections in some provinces. I hope this won’t happen in the upcoming local elections later this year. Let people vote as they like. - Letter by Rachel Molema, Theresa Mews
