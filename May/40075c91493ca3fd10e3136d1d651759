A TRADITIONAL healer who made headlines in February 2020 when he married six women on the same day has said he’s reconsidering his wish to have 14 wives in total. Speaking to Daily Sun on Wednesday 12 May, Faniyakhe “John 14” Mthembu from uMhlabuyalingana, northern KZN, said the Covid-19 pandemic had forced him to reconsider. “This disease hasn’t left us yet and it’s not clear if it’s going away any time soon,” he said “It would be selfish of me to make 14 women leave their homes, marry me and then I die. “Because I make most of my money from healing people, it means I could die sooner and they’ll suffer for the rest of their lives if I’m not here to provide for them.” He owns a few tuck shops, taxis, livestock, cottages and a lodge. He said he knows the businesses will provide for his seven wives if anything were to happen to him. He married his seventh wife, Samke Nene, in February 2021. Faniyakhe has 21 kids from his first six wives. “I spend about R300 000 a year on my entire family,” he said. Faniyakhe’s wife, Hloniphile (38), said: “When I got into polygamy I thought it would be difficult, but I was taken by surprise by how easy it was. He treats us all the same and we’re like sisters.” However, Hloniphile said, she didn’t think a proposed law to allow women to have multiple husbands would work. “Men are too jealous. This law will cause a lot of problems as they will either kill the wife or the second husband,” she said. Faniyakhe agreed with his wife, saying jails and mortuaries would be jampacked with wife killers.
