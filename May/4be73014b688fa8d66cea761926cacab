Mamelodi Sundowns DStv Diski Challenge Rewired coach Surprise Moriri says they are well aware of the danger posed by AmaZulu in Sunday's game. The two sides will clash in the Diski Rewired final at FNB Stadium. The kick-off will be at 11am CAT (SA, GMT+2). AmaZulu reached the finals of the Diski Rewired without losing a match, which is a considerable concern for Moriri, who noted that the Durban outfit would give them serious problems on the day as they are no pushovers. Talking to Sundowns media, Moriri said: “For us, we are very happy for the boys for qualifying for the final. They (players) have worked hard. Now we are facing AmaZulu, who reached the finals. It will be a very tough game, and we are aware of the threat that AmaZulu pose. “On Sunday is going to be a very tough game. We are aware that if we do not give our best on the day AmaZulu will give us problems. We will go all out. We are working hard, technical team and the players.” As much as they have been one of the free-scoring teams in the Diski Rewired, Moriri is not yet satisfied as he stated that they would need to be more clinical against Usuthu to avoid any disappointments. He enthuses: “For us, we are very happy for the boys for qualifying for the final. They have really worked hard. But now against AmaZulu, we will make sure the boys will have to utilise the chances because we created a lot of chances but struggle to convert.” Moriri also congratulated star midfielder Siyanda Nyanga, who has been nominated among the top players of the tournament. Nyanga is nominated alongside Lindokuhle Zungu of AmaZulu and Orlando Pirates striker Boitumelo Radiopane. Talking about the young prospect, Moriri said: “With Siyanda being nominated, to be honest, he deserves to be nominated. He is a very hard worker, very humble. He knows what he works and in our recent past two games he won man of the match awards in both matches.” -SuperSport
