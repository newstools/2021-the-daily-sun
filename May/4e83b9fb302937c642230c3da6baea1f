BAFANA Bafana new coach Hugo Broos has appointed former national team winger Helman Mkhalele as his assistant coach. Ncane, as he is known in football, will work with Broos’ european assistant Cedomir “Cede” Janevski. Broos, who won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2017 with Cameroon, in his first press conference when was announced as the Bafana Bafana coach, made it clear that he needed a Mzansi’s assistant to work with. He was initiailly keen to get Molefi Ntseki, the man Broos replaced, having had meetings with him but Safa NEC rejected the idea. “Safa and Bafana Bafana coach have appointed former Bafana Bafana winger Helman Mkhalele as the local assistant coach,” Safa tweeted. Mkhalele, who earned 66 caps and scored eight goals in the process – having made his debut on 26 November 1994 against Ghana, was elevated into this position as he was the national under-20 coach. As a player, he was part of Bafana Bafana that lifted the 1996 African Cup of Nations in Mzansi. He was also part of the national team that qualified for the 1998 World Cup finals which was the first time Mzansi debuted. During that World Cup qualifying process, Mkhalele will forever be remembered for scoring in the 3-0 victory over Zambia in June 1997 at FNB Stadium.
