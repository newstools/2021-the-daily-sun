New Bafana Bafana assistant coach, Cedomir "Cede" Janevski, will come to South Africa to team up with head coach Hugo Broos on the back of a Cyprus defeat this past weekend. His side Olympiakos Nicosia went down 2-1 in the extra time at the hands of Cyprus giants Anorthosis Famagusta. Nicosia, who finished the season sixth on the log table after 26 matches from a league comprising 14-teams. His club started the cup match on the back foot as Famagusta scored first in the 59th minute. But Cede’s side equalised through Ghanaian Kingsley Sarfo two minutes later. The match finished deadlocked after 90 minutes. But Famagusta again took the lead in extra time and were able to hold on until 120 minutes to win the cup for the 10th time. This was Cede's last game in Cyprus and is expected in Sout Africa this week. He was confirmed by Broos as his foreign assistant coach last week. Cede, along with Broos’ Mzansi’s assistant coach, will be on the bench for the two friendly matches in June, against Botswana and Uganda. But Broos, who helped Cameroon win the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), will not be on the bench for two friendlies, as he'll undergo his second Covid-19 vaccination in Belgium. These friendly matches have been arranged after Fifa and Caf postponed the continent’s 2022 World Cup qualifiers to September. But Broos will be back for the Fifa qualifiers against Zimbabwe and Ghana in September.
