THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) has resolved to move the last day of the 2020/21 DStv Premiership from Saturday, 29 May 2021, until Saturday, 05 June 2021. The current season has been highly compressed due to the delayed commencement date as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. The league has continued to make every effort to ensure that the fixtures are not changed or delayed save in the most extreme conditions. However, in certain instances particularly those relating to CAF competitions, this has been avoidable.In order to remain true to the principle that the last matches in the DStv Premiership are played on the same day (s), the final fixtures have been altered as detailed in the attached amended fixture list.
