THE Educators Union of South Africa has called for the immediate shut down of schools amid the third wave. In a statement released on Wednesday evening, 19 May, the union said many schools were lacking personal protective equipment and said there’s an increase in Covid-19 cases among the teachers and pupils. “With Gauteng, Free State and the Eastern Cape having declared they have reached the third wave, it’s inevitable that the whole country will follow soon. “KZN, Mpumalanga, North West and the Western Cape have been reported to also be experiencing sustained increases over the last few weeks,” said union spokesman Kabelo Mahlobogwane.

He said that schools played a huge role in the resurgence of the virus as safety protocols are being ignored by principals. “It’s a known fact that almost all schools do not have PPEs, while cases of infected learners are increasing tremendously.” He claimed that some pupils in public schools last received their PPEs in June last year. “More than 70% of schools in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo still do not have running water. This puts the lives of our teachers and learners at risk as they cannot wash their hands after using pit toilets,” he said. “We have received worrying reports of principals who hide newly reported cases from their colleagues and the learner community. This means that contacts are not traced and advised to quarantine or get tested,” Mahlobogwane said.
