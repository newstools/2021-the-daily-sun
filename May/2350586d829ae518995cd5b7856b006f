THE Bajaj Qute, AKA the Chipi, was the talk of the town when Mzansi found out about it. This comes after a video of the small car that is classified as a quadricycle went viral for trying to do doughnuts and ended up sideways. The Chipi has struck again. This time at a filling station as two petrol attendants lifted the Bajaj like a piece of cake. In the video, the two petrol attendants can be seen lifting the white Bajaj from one side of the petrol pumps on the left to the right side of the petrol pumps.
