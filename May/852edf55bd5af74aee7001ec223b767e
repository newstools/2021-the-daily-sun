PITSO Mosimane and his charges Al Ahly have arrived in South Africa for the second leg of their African Champions League quarter-final clash, set for the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (3pm). The Team of the Century landed in Mzansi on Tuesday morning ahead of this titanic clash where the semi-finalists will be decided. They will be looking to complete the job they started in Cairo, Egypt last weekend. They are coming to this encounter with a 2-0 lead, and this promises to be a blockbuster considering that the star-studded Sundowns will not go down without a fight.The Brazilians coach Manqoba Mngqithi remains confident that his side have enough capacity to overturn the score and proceed to the last four of the continental showpiece."I still have respect for Al Ahly and I think they've got a lot of young and intelligent players‚ but this one (last Saturday's game) is a first half‚ the second one is in Pretoria," Mngqithi told reporters. Mosimane will be returning to Atteridgeville's Lucas Moripe Stadium for the first time since he left Sundowns to join Ahly last season.  ??
