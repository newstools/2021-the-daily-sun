TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila liaison manager Rufus Matsena has clarified the issue of the medals following their Nedbank Cup triumph on Saturday. A tally of 11 club members have not received their medals. This is because the club is still trying to find a place to make the shot medals. Matsena rubbished the rumours making rounds that he and the club boss Abram Sello took five medals, resulting in other members not getting them. The Nedbank Cup came with 35 medals, and TTM have 38 members who should have get medals. Matsena told SunSport that the chairman took eight medals to keep them while still in the process of making the shot. “It is not true that the chairman and I are keeping the medals for ourselves, “ Matsena said. “IF I take five medals what I am going to do with the? We explained to the players who did not get them that we have eight remaining medals, and we are still trying to get where we can make them.” “Everyone will get their medals,” Matsena assured. Matsena also explained that players would share 50% of the winnings, and other staff at the club will share the other 50%. He stated: “The chairman has been clear that he will not take a cent from it but the entire staff will share the money equally, they deserve it, they worked very hard for this honour.” TTM will now switch focus to DStv Premiership, where they will be fighting to save their elite league status. On Wednesday, they will face unpredictable SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium (5pm). TTM are placed 14th on the log with 25 points from 25 games - one more than 15th placed Chippa and seven above Black Leopards, who are languishing at the foot of the log.
