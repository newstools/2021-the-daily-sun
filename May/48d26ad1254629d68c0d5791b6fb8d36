BUDDING Mamelodi Sundowns star Promise Mkhuma has been touted as the next “Themba Zwane”. Mkhuma was promoted into the first team in January last year after proving his worth in the DStv Diski Challenge. Since his promotion, the Daveyton-born Mkhuma has made cameo appearances in the first team. Competing in the same position with Zwane and Lebohang Maboe has not made things any easier for him. However, that has not demotivated him in anyway as he is working hard to earn the place. Last weekend he came in as a sub when Sundowns were defeated 2-0 by Al Ahly in the Caf Champions League quarterfinal in Egypt. The player says he has been progressing since joining the first team and believes it will only take him hard work, which he is willing to put in to be a regular in the team. “For a youngster like me coming into the team it has been good, I always put hard work first,” the player said. “For me working hard is not a problem, I just need to stay focused and try to contribute to the team. I believe that we are doing well as a team. My coaches, all the technical staff and the players have been supporting us youngsters to help us do well. They complement us when we do well at training and they motivate us when we play games and I think with their support and our hard work we’re fine as youngsters.” The SA Under-20 and 23 international will be hoping to get another run this weekend in Downs do or die clash against the Egyptian giants. The Brazilians will be aiming to overturn the 2-0 deficit and qualify for the tournament's semi-finals. The blockbuster encounter is billed for Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday 3pm.
