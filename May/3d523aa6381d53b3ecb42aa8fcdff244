KAIZER Chiefs coach, Gavin Hunt, has admitted that his side has had endless problems this season. “We had problems for every game,” Hunt disclosed. “Players have not all been available right from the start of the season. That is what it is, we just have to take this game in front of us on Wednesday. We are going to have a lot of players out on Wednesday due to suspension and injury, so we will have to work with those available.” Chiefs will miss five players in this match due to injuries and suspensions. Willard Katsande and Njabulo Blom are suspended, while Khama Billiat, Dumisani Zuma and Lebohang Lesako are missing due to an assortment of injuries. Amakhosi, who have not had a good campaign, are currently 11th on the DStv Premiership log with 30 points from 27 matches. On Wednesday, Hunt will be hoping to keep their chances of finishing in the top eight when they face Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium in Limpopo (3pm). However, that will not be an easy task as 16th-placed Leopards are trying to save their lucrative PSL status. Chiefs recently returned from Caf Champions League duties in Tanzania but Hunt said he was not unhappy with their busy travelling schedule, saying it was part and parcel. He stated: “… it has been happening this season, which is good. “However, we now have to get our league form right. We have had one day’s training. Obviously, the game against Leopards is a big one for us.” In the first round, the two sides played t a thrilling 2-2 draw at FNB Stadium where Ovidy Karuru scored a brace, and Chiefs goals came from Bernard Parker and Nkosingiphile Ngcobo.
