PUPILS and commuters were left stranded in Nelson Mandela Bay after taxi drivers blocked roads with burning tyres. Uncedo Taxi Association taxi drivers took to the streets on Tuesday morning, 25 May demanding pay from the Covid-19 relief fund from Uncedo Taxi Association bosses. The taxi drivers’ representative Ndumiso Nqesha, speaking to Daily Sun from Cross Road Taxi Rank in Motherwell, said the reason behind their strike is the Covid-19 relief fund dispute between them as taxi drivers and Uncedo Taxi Association. “Since January, we have been waiting for our payments after some of us received payments in December. After we submitted our grievances to the association chairman and gave him an ultimatum to respond to our grievances, he failed to respond, and we took our matter to the Department of Labour. “To our surprise, the department said according to their records we have been paid R5 293,25 since June last year. “We took to the streets because we are concerned about Uncendo Taxi Association’s failure to release the Covid-19 relief fund promised to us as deserving taxi drivers and taxi operators.” Nqesha said: “We will protest for as long as it takes for Uncendo Taxi Association to accede to our demand of our Covid-19 relief funds promised to us.” Some schools were closed in Motherwell due to transport issues that caused pupils and teachers not to get transport. Uncendo Taxi Association spokesman Kwayiyo Msuthwana said: “I can’t comment at the moment as I don’t have the full information. I need to communicate with the association executive first.” Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: “The public order police are monitoring the situation.”
