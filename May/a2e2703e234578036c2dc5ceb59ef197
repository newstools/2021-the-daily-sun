TEACHERS at this kasi school were happy when they received much-needed desks recently. This was after Hlanganani Business Solutions donated 22 office desks to the Rolihlahla Primary School in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, last week. Excited teachers said the help came at the right time. Company director Phineas Baloyi said they’ve already donated to 10 schools around Ekurhuleni. “I visited a school in Vosloorus and I saw a teacher sitting on a plastic chair without a desk,” he said. He said he then vowed to make a difference. “I went back to that school and we told the teachers we want to donate desks for them and they welcomed us,” he told Daily Sun. Phineas said seven schools in Vosloorus, one in Katlehong, one in Reigerpark and one in Etwatwa have received desks from their company. “We also donated a printer to a school in Vosloorus.” He said they imported the desks from overseas and sold them in Mzansi. He said at Rolihlahla Primary School nine of the 22 desks were taken to a boardroom while the rest were taken to the staff room. “We believe that providing people with the right tools to do their work is a huge boost for morale,” Phineas said. Rolihlahla principal Sipho Khoza said they were very grateful for the donation as it has made a big difference in their lives.
