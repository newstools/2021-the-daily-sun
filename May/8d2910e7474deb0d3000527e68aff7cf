FORMER Prasa CEO Lucky Montana has accused the Zondo Commission and its witnesses of tarnishing his name. He gave evidence yesterday related to allegations that he bought four houses valued at R36 million with proceeds of corruption from Prasa. Montana said evidence leader Vas Soni SC asked him questions in a way that fit a particular narrative. He accused him of leaving out certain information in order to paint him as corrupt. Montana told the commission that before he bought the houses, he already owned three more. “My properties were financed by Absa through a facility called private one bank account to a tune of R10,5 million. My monthly repayment was R95 900,” he said. He said he sold one of them to fund the new houses, and that reduced the principal debt to R8,3 million. Montana said he was a serial property investor and at one stage, went into a joint venture with another company to build 15 luxury units in Sandhurst. He said Soni and commission witness Clint Oleman ignored that fact as they wanted to show the world he was corrupt. “Why Soni is setting it up in the manner he does is basically aimed at sustaining that false narrative,” he said. Montana said all these lies about his properties came from a criminal gang, including private investigator Paul O’Sullivan. “They were here to damage my name so the country is told Montana is involved in corrupt properties. “There was no interest in the truth. ‘He gave the Siyangena contract so he can get properties’. It’s false.” He claimed people who worked with O’Sullivan, whom he called the Irish extortionist, demanded R500 million to “help” him solve his problems. Montana said one of the properties he’s accused of buying with Prasa money was actually bought in 2004, and he only started working for Prasa in 2006. He said he later sold it.
