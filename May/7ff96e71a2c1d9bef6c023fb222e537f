THERE might be good news for Mzansi motorists at the pumps next month. Some will go up while some will go down – that’s the picture for the month-end fuel price change according to the Automobile Association. The AA was commenting on unaudited midmonth fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. The AA is forecasting a slight decline of about one cent a litre for petrol, while diesel is set for a 20 cents-a-litre increase, with illuminating paraffin indicating a rise of 25 cents. “After several weeks of stability, international oil prices have started to climb again, with a slight peak in the first week of May before a modest pullback, although there’s still a re-balancing of global supply and demand taking place in oil markets,” the AA said. This suggests normal market forces are increasingly gaining the upper hand over last year’s disruptive gluts which led to astonishing sub-zero prices for West Texas Intermediate oil. The AA noted that oil prices are still vulnerable to lockdowns caused by resurgences of Covid-19, in particular new variants of the virus. “Nothing should be taken for granted until the global vaccination drive has surpassed the threshold needed for herd immunity,” said the AA. The AA said the rand’s surprising strength is helping to offset the oil price gains. The association further said that while the mid-month picture is indicating certain movements, they’re likely to change before the official adjusted price for June is announced by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy later this month.
