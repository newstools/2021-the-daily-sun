GATVOL residents of Matlakeng in Zastron, Free State attacked the house of Mohokare Mayor Irene Mehlomakhulu on Wednesday, 19 May. The attack was prompted by a service delivery protest that started earlier this week. The residents are protesting against poor service delivery in Zastron. According to residents, there has been no refuse removal in Matlakeng for more than three years, some of the areas have no running water, sewage connections are incomplete, roads infrastructure is dilapidated and municipal buildings are in a state of decay and collapse. The DA in Mohokare Municipality condemns the attack on the mayor’s home.  DA caucus leader Ian Riddle said while they can appreciate the anger of the community, which is fuelled by the lack of basic service delivery, they cannot condone lawlessness. “We therefore urge law enforcement agencies to intervene in the continuous unrest in our area and bring the perpetrators of this act to account. We, however, say failure to deliver basic services is sufficient evidence that the ANC can no longer efficiently govern the municipality.  We too have lost confidence in the incumbent mayor and her administration,” he said. The mayor could not be reached for comment. Free State police spokesman Brigadier Motansi Makhele said a case has not been opened yet.
