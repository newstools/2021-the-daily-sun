THE door back to Bafana Bafana looks close shut for Molefi Ntseki. But the ex-Bafana coach is in no way despairing. There are other opportunities on the horizon for the man who was unceremoniously sacked two months ago. According to Ntseki’s manager, Thato Matuka, they are looking to get him back in action as soon he has completed his resting period. Ntseki had been in talks with Safa to return to the national team set-up, this time as the assistant to his predecessor Hugo Broos. The Belgian had recommended Ntseki as his second lieutenant after he appointed Cedomir Janevski. But Ntseki could not agree on terms with his former employers, leading to the termination of the talks on Tuesday. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t agree on terms with Safa. We had lengthy talks as the coach was willing to work with the new coach,” said Matuka. “But we would like to thank the association for everything they did for the coach.” Although Ntseki has never coached at the club level, Matuka said they were not ruling out anybody, including offers from teams. “We are open to offers, even on the domestic front,” added Matuka. “The coach will be ready to get back to action.” The Safa technical committee is set to meet tomorrow to discuss outstanding matters of the Bafana technical team and the possible candidates, with the name of national Under 23 side coach, David Notoane, now top of the list.
