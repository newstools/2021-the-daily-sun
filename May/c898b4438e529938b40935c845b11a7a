IT’S another instalment of Phuza or Thirsty Thursday, where we toast to another productive week. While admittedly we don’t need any reason to consume bev, things can go south pretty quickly if one drink becomes one too many. The results thereof often overlap to the following day, which results in a babalas. While the night before may have been a night to remember, the results in the morning may be one you quickly don’t want to remember. According to Lovin Entertainment magazine, there are seven types of hangovers one can experience. Let’s take a shot at each one: 1. The Gradual Hangover This is the most potent of them all because it’s a hangover that builds up during the course of the day. While you might wake up feeling fresh and daisy, your mood might change for the worse during the course of the day. 2. The Exorcist Hangover This type of hangover involves a bucket, a toilet and lots of vomiting. The most chaotic of them all. 3. The Emotional Hangover Woke up feeling sad and emotional about the bev from the night before? Then you might have suffered an emotional hangover. 4. The Blackout If like Eskom you had a blackout about the night before, then you suffered a blackout where you have zero recollection of what happened the night before. 5. The Food Hangover Feel like something greasy and spicy the next day? Then you might be suffering from the food hangover. 6. The Fear Hangover There’s nothing worse than waking up and having the fear of what happened the night before. That’s the fear hangover speaking. 7. Escaped Hangover If you wake feeling fresh and great. Then you escaped and survived the night before.
