KAIZER Chiefs have advanced to the Caf Champions League  semi-finals for the first time in history despite suffering a 3-0 loss to Simba SC in Tanzania on Saturday afternoon. Amakhosi were thumped 3-0 at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Saturday, but advanced 4-3 on aggregate.A 4-0 win for the Amakhosi in the first leg in Soweto last weekend suggested this match should have been a straightforward affair, but the Tanzanian tried to fight back at their home yard. The hosts enjoyed early dominance and forced Chiefs onto the back foot, with Luis Miquissone threatening down the left flank and almost finding the target with a shot from a tight angle in the seventh minute.Chiefs could have broke the deadlock under 15 minutes when Lebogang Manyama provided a great cross from the right to pick out unmarked Leonardo Castro, but the he could not make a clean connection with his header.Just past the midway point of the first half Wekundu wa Msimbazi reduced the aggregate deficit to 4-1, with John Bocco forcing a shot beyond goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma to spark hope for the hosts The goal sparked an intense period of attacking pressure from Simba, who forced Bvuma into a couple of outstanding saves to deny Bocco and Chama. The two sides went to the half time with the hosts leading.Simba pressure continued after the restart and a second goal arrived in the 56th minute: Miquissone did great work to get past Reeve Frosler down the hosts’ left before playing a dangerous low cross which deflected off a Chiefs defender and was turned home at close range by Bocco.The hosts should have further reduced the deficit on 72 minutes when Mugalu latched onto Morrison’s pull-back from the right by-line, but his shot was sent straight into the arms of a grateful Bvuma.Yet the third goal did arrive in the 86th minute, with Chama driving into the box and producing a perfectly-placed right-footed shot which beat Bvuma’s left-hand, made it 3-0 on the day (3-4 overall) and teed up a dramatic finale.Amakhosi mnaged to hold on to the pressure to secure a 4-3 aggregate triumph.Chiefs will face either MC Alger or Wydad Casablanca in next month’s semifinals
