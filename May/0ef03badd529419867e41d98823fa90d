Legendary Afro pop group Malini is back after a five-year hiatus. Durban-based vocalists Mdu Ntombela and Thofo Goge aim to leave a mark in the now popular amapiano. They’ve released an amapiano single titled Ingoma. The Ucingo hitmakers last released an album, their seventh, in 2015. The album was called Uhambo. The group, formed in 2004, made their name with the hit song Jikelele. Mdu told SunBuzz: “If you listen to many amapiano songs, they have the same rhythm. “We decided to make amapiano songs that differ in many ways. “We wanted to add our version to the genre but not lose its original rhythm.” ALSO READ |  WATCH: RAPPER AKA BARES IT ALL Malini has released many other hit songs such as Us’bali, Balele and Izinkinga. He said the songs accommodate everyone, and those from various genres. “We added an African rhythm to our vocals and kept it as Mzansi amapiano,” he said. “The message on the song? We’re telling our fans that we’re still in the game and not going anywhere.” The duo plan to release an album next year. “For now we’ll continue to release singles. We’re working on a new single titled Iyagodola, featuring Dumi Mkokstad. “It’s a love song with a mixture of Afro pop and gospel.” Mdu said they won’t be changing their signature tune because their fans still love it.
