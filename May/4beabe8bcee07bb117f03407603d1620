Fifteen people were killed and 70 hurt when an overpass carrying Mexico City metro train cars partially collapsed on to a road on Monday night, authorities said. A dramatic video on local channel Milenio TV shows the overpass of the metro's 12 line collapsing on top of cars on a road below. Videos on television and social media showed emergency medical crews and firefighters combing through the wreckage looking for survivors. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said 15 people were killed and that a car was trapped under the rubble. Sheinbaum said on Twitter "unfortunately there are dead and injured people. I am on site supporting the installation of the command center." The city's Comprehensive Risk Management and Civil Protection Agency initially put the toll at 13 and 70 people injured. #BREAKING: 13 dead, at least 70 injured when Metro Train in Mexico City falls onto cars below when overpass collapses.
