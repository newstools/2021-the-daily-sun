PARENTS from Maqamela Primary School in KaBokweni, Mpumalanga are worried about their kids’ safety. This after a 10-year-old pupil was allegedly raped by an unknown man on Tuesday, 11 May. The man apparently entered the fully fenced school and followed the child to the toilet. He allegedly threatened to kill her if she reported the matter. Speaking at the school on Thursday, 20 May, parents told Daily Sun there’s a security guard at the school, so they couldn’t understand how the man gained entry. They removed their children from the school and said they would bring them only when they were assured safety measures were put in place. Parent Sifiso Nene (42) said: “The school has still not called a parents’ meeting. We want the school management to give us a report because our children are no longer safe here. “They need to explain how this happened.” Another concerned parent said they wanted to be properly addressed on the matter. “We don’t get answers when we ask questions. “We need clarity because we feel our children are not safe at this school,” said the parent. Mpumalanga education spokesman Jasper Zwane said: “The department is disturbed by the incident and views it very seriously. “Given the nature of the allegations, the matter was referred to the police. “The department sent officials to render the required support to the pupils and everyone affected by this sad development. “The officials will also investigate the circumstances that led to this incident.” Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that a rape case was opened and investigations were underway.
