NATIONAL Under-23 coach, David Notoane, has his dream of having a competitive squad for the Tokyo Olympic Games thrown into a chaos. According to SunSport sources, PSL clubs are refusing to release their players for a scheduled tournament in the United Arab Emirates next month. Clubs are being resistant to Notoane because the 2020-21 PSL programme has been extended to end 5 June from 29 May. Notoane’s men were invited in UAE tourney, set for 5-11 June, where they will face Brazil, Korea and Argentina as they prepare for the Olympic Games. Baroka FC have refused to release Goodman Mosele and Evidence Makgopa, while Golden Arrows refused to release Sifiso Mlungwana. Kaizer Chiefs are holding on to Njabulo Blom, Happy Mashiane, Siyabonga Ngezana while are holding on to Orlando Pirates’ Bongani Sam and Thabo Monyane, and Stellenbosch FC refused to release Ashley du Preez. These are some of the players whom Notoane named in his 40th preliminary squad last month for the Olympics, but now he can’t have them in the tournament, which Notoane described as the perfect opportunity to see them before the main event. These players were also part of Notoane’s camp in Durban in March after he couldn’t get friendly matches required. Notoane said then in Durban he was hoping to have them in this tournament, but clubs have refused. This now puts him into a further complication as there are doubts if they will be called up for the Olympic Games in July and August. According to sources, Notoane was aiming to field these players in this tourney as part of dress rehearsal for the Olympic Games. He has been left doubting if he will ever get such strong matches before the main event. The Under-23s squad will leave on Monday for the UAE tournament. Notoane was not available for comment.
