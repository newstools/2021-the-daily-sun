POLICE arrested two men for stealing a crane after it was discovered parked in Marikana squatter camp in Philippi on Tuesday. Cops said the estimated value of the crane was R2,5 million. It was found to have been reported as stolen in Khayelitsha at Lingelethu cop shop. “The crane was tested and it was established that it was reportedly stolen, linked to a Lingelethu West case number. Two men, aged 30 and 36, were arrested. Once charged, they will appear in the Athlone Magistrates Court for possession of suspected stolen property,” said police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk. A resident said they were shocked to see a crane at the spot where thieves parked cars to “cool” down. “The area is a well-known spot where car thieves park to check if it has a tracker. After some time, they go and strip it off. I heard from my son, who passed by the area, that there was a huge truck parked at the spot for car thieves,” said the resident. Another source told Daily Sun that the crane was stolen at a building site somewhere in Khayelitsha. It is alleged that the two suspects did not use force to steal it – they lied and said they wanted to take it for service. “They allegedly walked to a site and asked security for the keys, saying they wanted to get it fixed. This is how they disappeared with it,” said the source. Capetonians still had more questions than answers about the incident. “How did they even manage to drive it from Khayelitsha to Marikana?” asked Vuyani Hlahla from Philippi.
