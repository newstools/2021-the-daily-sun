SA Football Association president Danny Jordaan has sent a congratulatory message to newly crowned DStv Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns. The Brazilians became the first team since the advent of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) in 1996 to win the league title for four successive seasons. Sundowns won the league just after 27 matches with 60 points. In the 27 matches, under the guidance of coach Manqoba Mngqiti, Steve Komphela, and Rhulani Mokwena, Sundowns only lost one match. On Wednesday, Sundowns defeated crosstown rivals Supersport United 3-1 to seal yet another league title. "I would like to congratulate the club for a great season in which they participated in various tournaments and still came out tops in the marathon league campaign," said Jordaan. "Well done to the players, the technical and support staff and last but not least, new club chairman Thlopane Motsepe," said Dr Jordaan. Sundowns will again be playing in the Caf Champions League campaign and Jordaan said the rigorous programme means the players will have little time to celebrate and rest but start preparing for the upcoming season and demanding travels on the African continent. "One thing for sure is that these players are battle hardened and we expect them to once more do the country proud in the CAF Champions League competition," added Jordaan. In the remaining games Sundowns will play against Swallows FC, Bloemfontein Celtic and their last match of the campaign will be againstÂ Cape Town City on 5 June at Loftus Stadium.
