SPEAKERS at Zithulele “Majotha” Zungu’s memorial service said he was liked by almost every maskandi artist because he never involved himself in any squabbles. Majotha’s memorial service was held on Saturday, 15 May, at Duffs Road Community Hall in KwaMashu, north of Durban. One of the artists that attended the memorial service, Gadla Nxumalo, said Majotha (39) focused on producing music. “That’s the only thing he knew and he did the best. You wouldn’t find him in the midst of squabbles. All he did was focus on making his music,” said Gadla. Majotha died last Friday, 7 May, at King Edward VIII Hospital after a short illness. Gadla said Majotha’s death left him numb. ALSO READ: BRENDA FASSIE'S SISTER, LINDIWE DIES “Naturally, I’m a bubbly person. Each time I get to stand in front of people, I do it joyfully but Majotha’s passing shocked the hell out of me. It’s painful. It’s one of the worst things I’ve ever had to go through,” said Gadla.  Majotha’s brother, Mandla Zungu, said the amount of support they’ve been getting shows Majotha was a people’s person.
