THE race for the GladAfrica Championship title and automatic promotion to the DStv Premiership is set to go down to the wire. This as teams in Mzansi’s second division continue to push each other to the limit in a battle for a spot in the land of milk and honey. And this season has so far proven to be one of the most tightly contested and exciting in recent history. The last two matches of the season are set to decide the destination of the title and the team that will automatically move up to play with the big boys. As things stand, Royal AM will play in the PSL next season after they toppled long time log leaders Richards Bay this past weekend. Their 2-1 win over TS Sporting on Saturday saw them climb above their KZN rivals. And Richards Bay’s 2-1 loss to JDR Stars on Sunday meant that they could not regain top spot. The Natal Rich Boyz are now in second place with 45 points from 28 matches, two adrift of new leaders Royal AM. There is now no room for error for Simo Dladla’s men, who have to win their two remaining matches at all cost and hope their rivals drop points. But the wheels seem to be coming off at a crucial stage of the season for Richards Bay, who led the pack for the better part of the season. They will look to regain control when they face Jomo Cosmos at Tsakane Stadium in their penultimate match of the season on Sunday. But Royal AM are in full control and only have to win their two remaining matches – starting with the University of Pretoria on the same day – to be crowned champions. The likes of Sekhukhune United, TS Sporting and JDR Stars will be hoping for a slip up from both KZN teams at the top of the table.
