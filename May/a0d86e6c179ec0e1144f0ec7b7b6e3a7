We were blessed with a baby princess. Yes, I was neither ready nor prepared but boy oh boy. I never understood the impact and joy that she would bring to our family,” she wrote “I would do anything and everything in my power to protect her from this world as she is one of the thing I call my place of safety and comfort. Every time when I come home and I see her, my day is full, I LOVE YOU BABY FLO,” wrote Mamkhize. Shared post on Time  Shared post on Time
