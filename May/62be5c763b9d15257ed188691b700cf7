TOP fashion designer Thula Sindi and The Queen actor, Vuyo Ngcukana, recently lashed out at church leaders. The debate was started by Vuyo when he confronted church leaders for being called “daddy”. He wrote on his Twitter page: “This thing of religious people in leadership positions being called ‘daddy’.” To which Thula responded: “Like gang leaders, they try to take up actual father/mother roles in a perverse family structure. For criminal purposes, to fleece people or take advantage of them sexually. Churches, cults and gangs all operate in the same way. Replace real connections with false ones.” ALSO READ: BREAKING: BISHOP MAKAMU STEPS DOWN! Vuyo’s fans could not agree with him more. Zandy Msiya said: “It annoys the hell out of me, yerrrr!” Aubrey Drey wrote: “Agh, it gets on my nerves. And those very same people don’t even have respect for their own biological parents.” Trev Tshisikhawe commented: “I hate that. I used to tell my younger brother that it’s b***s***, and he would disagree. Calling someone, who’s not even your dad’s age, daddy or mommy.” Like gang leaders they try to take up actual father/mother roles in a perverse family structure. For criminal purposes, to fleece ppl or to take advantage of them sexually. Churches, cults, gangs all operate in same way. Replace real connections & replace them with false ones https://t.co/7lLLaQiLIS
