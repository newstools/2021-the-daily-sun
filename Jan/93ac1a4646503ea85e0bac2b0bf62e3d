Kuhle, who was one of two winners of the SABC3 Presenter Search in 2019, was placed on the show in Cape Town, Western Cape. Speaking to SunBuzz about her purpose and the legacy she wants to leave behind, Kuhle said: “I just want to impart knowledge and contribute to black culture. “I want to have conversations about being black, whether they’re fun or not. “Being black isn’t fun sometimes. I’m the only black woman on the show. “I feel like it’s my responsibility to speak out and teach people, especially when they say the wrong things about, for example, black hair, black music or black women in professional spaces. “Only now, as I’m about to turn 25, this idea of contributing to black culture is solidifying in my head and I’ll do it.” ALSO READ | JONAS JOINS BRA HUGH Kuhle said she’s working on branching out into bigger platforms. “I’m not working on a particular thing at the moment.
