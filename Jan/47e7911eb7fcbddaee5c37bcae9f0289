SHE bought rats from an online sangoma to make loads of cash, but the opposite is happening! “My money is disappearing while I sleep,” said Natasha Chisimuka (33) from Marathon squatter camp in Germiston, Ekurhuleni. “The sangoma told me that when I woke up I’d see the money the rats brought. But when I look there’s nothing!” Natasha has lost R7 800 so far. She said the sangoma, whom she now believed to be fake, advertised his business in the newspaper. “I thought it was genuine because it was in the paper,” she said. “I’ve been calling him to get my money back, but he ignores my calls.” Natasha said she wanted to open a food business, but didn’t have enough cash. So when she saw the advert she decided to take a chance. “The advert sounded so good, but I ended up losing money,” she said. “I urge other people who read newspapers to be careful around some izangoma we see advertising in the paper.” He said the fake sangoma is Malawian. “They’re just out there to trick people and make money. Things they are promising are not there.” Natasha, originally from Zimbabwe, wanted to open the business to improve the lives of her folk back home. “Life is hard at home and opening the business would have helped a lot.” Natasha was working as a domestic worker last year when she was retrenched due to lockdown. “I wanted to create a source of income. Little did I know I was attracting problems to myself.”
