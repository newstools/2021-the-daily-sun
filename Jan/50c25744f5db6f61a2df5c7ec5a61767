GOVERNMENT officials, family and close friends paid an emotional tribute to the Mthembu family on Friday 22 January through a drive-by visit. Cars lined-up outside the late Minister Jackson Mthembu's house in Ackerville, Mpumalanga. Mthembu's colleagues dropped off flowers with messages of condolences. Mthembu passed away on Thursday 21 January due to Covid-19 complications. Director-General of Government Communication and Information Systems, Phumla Williams shared how Mthembu was dedicated his job. She told mourners the government, especially the departments he led, were all heartbroken by his passing. "We want to use this opportunity to thank the family for borrowing us Minister Mthembu to work for the nation. He was a committed hard worker. He led us well. Minister Mthembu allowed us to share our opinions on how to make the government work with the people of South Africa better. Even when we made mistakes he would correct us and we learnt from him,” she said. The Presidency has announced the late minister will be honoured with an official state funeral category 1 at his home on Sunday. In a statement, President Cyril Ramaphosa has requested that the national flag be flown at half-mast at every flag station in the country from Saturday morning until the Sunday evening. “Minister Mthembu contributed immensely to the liberation struggle as an anti-apartheid activist, student leader and unionist, for which he was subjected to harassment and detention by the apartheid security forces.” A memorial service will also be held today 23 January at the GCIS Auditorium in Hatfield, Tshwane.
