BRUCE Ngobeni was out driving near Belfast with his family when a group of bikers drove past him at such high speed he lost control of his car. The incident happened on Saturday in Mpumalanga. “I managed to get the car back onto the road, but one of them crashed,” he said. “I stopped the car and went to see if the guy was okay. But when I got there a group of bikers began hitting me.” He said his brother tried to stop them but he, too, was attacked. They got into the car and tried to drive to the cop shop, but a bakkie with bikes around it chased them. “The driver of the bakkie tried to force us off the road,” said Bruce. “It was as if they wanted the car to roll over. “The right rear wheel went flat and I was trying to control my car, but the bakkie came on the left side and tried to push us off the road again. “I ended up on the wrong side of the road. “I managed to make a U-turn and drive to the police station.” Bruce believes their intention was to kill him and his family. His brother, Vinny, said even when he tried to explain what had happened, the men wouldn’t stop assaulting them. “There were about 50 of them,” he said. Another motorist, Vusi Nkosi, said he saw the men beating up the two brothers and tried to record a video. “One of the men came to my car and started insulting me, asking why I was taking a video. “He began punching my windows. Luckily, I’d locked my door.” He said the bikers then damaged his car and windows. Vusi shared the video on social media. Mpumalanga cops spokesman, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, didn’t know the incident in the video was something that happened in the province. He said he’d contact the police station where the case had been opened to get an update.
