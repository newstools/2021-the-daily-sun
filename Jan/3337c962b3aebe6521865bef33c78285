OPERATION O Kae Molao, that started on Wednesday, has already yielded results. During the operation, information was received that there was a place where drugs were sold in Tshwane. Tshwane district police commissioner Major-General Hilda Mohajane said they quickly reacted to the information and found the owner, a 54-year-old white man. “We found a lot of dagga put in sealed bottles or glasses. Every sealed glass had a number and next to it was a glass with money,” she said. She added that this showed that the dagga was sold and put in a particular glass, with the money going to the next glass. She said the police also discovered lolly pops and cookies that showed they had been manufactured and mixed with dagga. “We will be taking those bottles and dagga to a forensic science lab to check what had been mixed. “During further search at the back, we found home-brewed alcohol that was being processed in 20-litre containers and put in different bottles with different names.” Mohajane said they conducted an expert search and requested the dog unit to assist. She said the drug unit team was also at the scene. “We also discovered that the owner had a firearm licence, but was found with five rifles, one pistol and a lot of ammunition.” She said that he indicated that some of the firearms were not his, which was contravention of the firearms act. “We will be charging him with the dealing of dagga, contravention of the firearms act and dealing with alcohol, which is contravention of disaster management act as we are in Covid-19 level 3 lockdown, which opposes the selling of alcohol.” Mohajane said the man was arrested and everything found illegal in his possession was confiscated. “I can indicate that the investigations will continue as we suspect that dagga is planted somewhere,” she added.
