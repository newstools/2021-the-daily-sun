FOR 30 years, Sarah Marokana (56) has been haunted by her late grandfather. Sarah from Klipgat, North West, said ever since her mkhulu died in her arms, he haunts her every night. After the mkhulu’s death, Sarah moved from his home and rented out the stand to a tenant. She believed that her grandfather’s soul was restless because his family didn’t live in the house. She said that she felt as if he had stopped her life and brought her bad luck. “When he comes to me, he says his yard is dirty and that he can’t find me there,” she said. “My life is stagnant. My children can’t get jobs and I can’t continue with my ukuthwasa journey because my grandfather is unhappy.” She said she had been doing rituals in the bushes to make peace with him. “It breaks my heart that he is so unhappy. I don’t know what to do anymore,” she said She had tried to talk to the people renting her grandfather’s stand, but they allegedly insulted her. “The woman said she has a title deed, and I don’t know how she got it because she is just a tenant,” she said. Sarah said she needed help to go back home so that her life could be normal again. When Daily Sun called the tenant, she said she had papers for the stand. “She must not bother me because this is my stand and I have a title deed. “If she brings hers then I will see what to do. But for now she must not come here and tell lies.”
