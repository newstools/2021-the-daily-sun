WE’RE in the midst of a season of death. Hardly a day goes buy without hearing of a Covid-19 death. Everyone has been broken and devastated by this cruel silent killer. After letting our guard down and spending time with our families during the summer holiday season, it soon became evident that the rampant virus was circulating viciously among us. We started burying our mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, sons and daughters. The virus showed us it doesn’t respect our rituals and traditions and still challenges us on how to conduct funerals. Having more than 50 people at a funeral still contributes to a high infection rates. While it has been unfortunate that churches remain closed, the decision to insist on their closure is still valid in the heat of this deadly second wave. It’s irresponsible of church leaders to campaign that churches must be opened. Many churches have suffered a great financial blow under lockdown, like so many other South Africans whose livelihood was negatively impacted. It can’t be that churches want to go down in history as wanting to put profit before people with their ill-advised calls. Opening those church gates will only contribute to killing more of our people. – Editor
