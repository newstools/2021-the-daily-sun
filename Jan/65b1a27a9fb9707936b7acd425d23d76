KASIS were shut down by angry residents calling for action at Emfuleni Municipality in the Vaal. Burning tyres, rocks and debris blocked main roads to Sharpeville and Boitumelo as protesters accused the municipality of corruption, demanding that Mayor Gift Moerane should step down. They wanted provincial government to act against corrupt leaders of the municipality facing issues of lack of service delivery, load shedding issues and lack of water in kasis. Community leader Themba Mnisi told Daily Sun that in spite of the municipality having been under administration, there hasn’t been any progress. “We’ve been patient, hoping it will get better.” Mnisi said all those who appeared in the forensic report about the Emfuleni Municipality must be suspended. “We want the national leadership to intervene. Serious action must be taken against corruption.” Police spokeswoman Thembeka Koago said four protesters were arrested. Acting municipal spokesman Makhosonke Sangweni said they were aware of the protests and certain issues. “Decisions and actions are taken by the municipality to address service delivery challenges. This includes appointment of contractors to deal with roads, sewer spillage and storm water issues. There are many actions already taken. “We’re ready to deal with these issues because there’s nothing to hide. We arranged with the office of the mayor to meet the protesters,” he said.
