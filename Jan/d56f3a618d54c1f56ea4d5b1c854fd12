Gatvol of being terrorised by card scammers in their kasi, residents of Langa in Cape Town decided to take matters into their own hands. They asked patrollers to be stationed at filling stations in their kasi to make sure people withdrawing cash from ATMs are safe. Bandile Gcuwa, the chairman of the patrollers, said they were approached by the community to assist them as they had already lost a lot of money to thugs. “Card scammers have been terrorising our people for far too long. When they asked for our services here, we didn’t hesitate. Even though our job is to keep them safe in the township, we took a decision to also assist them here,” said Bandile. He said ever since they have been stationed near ATMs, no one had lost their money. “Our people were getting robbed any time of the day but ever since we came here, people have been getting their money without fear of being robbed,” he said. Mahlubi Zibi, a secretary of the patrol group, said card scammers still visit the ATMs but they couldn’t do anything. “We know by doing this job we have automatically made enemies. Card scammers are not happy because we have stopped them from getting free money they have not worked for. They came here and saw us, and they stopped,” said Mahlubi. He said they have a mandate to keep residents safe. “We are slowly achieving the goal of making Langa a safe space. We can’t wait for other people to clean our areas. We will do so ourselves,” he said. Mahlubi said they decided to help residents because banks don’t offer refunds to those who’ve been robbed. Nosipho Bangani (34) said before Langa patrollers were stationed at ATMs, they had stopped drawing their money. “Card scammers were everywhere. We lost a lot of money. “If it wasn’t for the patrollers, many more people were still going to lose their money,” said Nosipho. She said as a community they are grateful to the patrollers.
