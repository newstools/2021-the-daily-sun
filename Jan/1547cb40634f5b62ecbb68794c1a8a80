GAUTENG Roads and Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo rolled up his sleeves yesterday and checked that Covid-19 regulations were being followed by drivers and commuters. Taximen came to the party and helped the MEC at a road block in Kameeldrift, Tshwane, during which taxis and buses were searched. He said it was important to ensure commuters, as well as bus and taxi drivers, wore masks. “We want to enforce the wearing of masks and compliance with regulations,” Mamabolo told Daily Sun. “This will help us to push back the spread of the virus in communities.” He said efforts to save lives were not up for discussion. “We’re happy that the taxi industry is taking a stand in protecting people, and that commuters are co-operating,” said Mamabolo. Santaco’s spokesman in Tshwane, McDonald Makata, said some drivers and commuters were not following lockdown regulations. He said: “We’re here to make them aware of the seriousness of the virus. “As law-abiding citizens, we want to play our part in enforcing compliance because, if people get infected, who are we going to transport?” The road blocks would continue throughout the week. “We won’t rest until we see our people following the directions given by government,” said Makata.
