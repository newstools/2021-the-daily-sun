THE Ndesana family want to know what really happened to their dead daughter, Sibonokuhle (19). Her aunt Pakama (37) from Langa, Cape Town, told Daily Sun the family last saw Sibonokuhle on Christmas Day before she visited friends in Philippi Browns Farm. “From what we heard from a friend, Sibonokuhle fought with her boyfriend at his home,” said Pakama. “The boyfriend’s mum had told them she heard the couple fighting, but when she asked to open the door the boyfriend told her they were fine. “The mother kicked the door open and found Sibonokuhle’s body.” Sibonokuhle matriculated last year. “She couldn’t further her studies after her mother lost her job, but she’d wanted to go further her studies and take care of her mum,” said Pakama. They found Sibonokuhle’s body at the mortuary had blood coming out of her nose. “She didn’t have any stab wounds. She must have hit her head because she had a cut on the back of her head,” she said. Resident Olwethu Mlungwana (43) said too many young girls in the area were being killed. “There’s something wrong with Philippi Browns Farm,” said Olwethu. Colonel Andre Traut said a suspect was arrested the day after Sibonokuhle’s body was discovered . “However, due to lack of evidence he wasn’t brought before the court. More evidence has been gathered and an arrest could be made,” said Traut. Resident Zusiphe Gibisa (45) told Daily Sun they found the body at midnight. “I think they stabbed him while everyone was excited about the New Year,” said Zusiphe. Residents said they don’t know the man and think he was stabbed elsewhere and dumped there. Zukile Memani (39) said people needed to follow lockdown regulations. “If he’d stayed in his house, this wouldn’t have happened. I feel sorry for him. I hope his family finds him,” said Zukile. Traut said circumstances surrounding the death are being investigated and a suspect is yet to be arrested.
