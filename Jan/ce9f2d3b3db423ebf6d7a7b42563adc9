PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will later this evening address
the nation on the government’s efforts to fight coronavirus pandemic as numbers
continue to rise and hospitals struggling to cope. His address comes amidst rumours and unconfirmed that the
country will be upgraded to level 4, inter provincial traveling banned and the
sale of alcohol to remain banned for at least another month. It is said Ramaphosa might also block the reopening of
schools as it is believed  that the new
variant affects children. The Presidency in a statement said the address followed
Ramaphosa’s meeting with the National Coronavirus Command Council, Cabinet and
the President’s Coordinating Council. It added that premiers and religious leaders have also been
consulted on the decisions that he will be announcing tonight. “President Ramaphosa also hosted a virtual engagement on
Sunday 10 January 2020 between government and interfaith leaders on the COVID-19
Risk Adjusted Strategy which is an inclusive national effort that enables
adaptive responses to the shifting pandemic. “This engagement focused on the unfolding pandemic in the
country and on the continent, including efforts to secure vaccines for all,” it
said. The President’s address will be broadcast and streamed on a
range of platforms that are accessible to South Africans and international
audiences. The restrictions on alcohol ban if extended is likely to
generate more outrage by the establishments and SAB which is heading to court
to challenge the constitutionality of the ban. The family meeting as these addresses have come to be known
will be at 8pm and broadcast on various platforms.
