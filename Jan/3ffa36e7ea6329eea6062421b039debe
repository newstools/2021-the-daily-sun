HEALTH MEC Sasekani Manzini has once again warned residents to be on the lookout for scammers who post fake job ads on social media. A fake ad of a nursing post went viral recently on various social media platforms. Bethal Hospital in Mpumalanga supposedly was short of nurses. Manzini told the People’s Paper: “We want to place it on record that the department uses print and various electronic media as channels for communicating or advertising vacant posts, or recent developments meant for public consumption. “So, community members are advised to ignore job ads that are only circulated on WhatsApp. “I want to urge residents not to fall for this scam. “Avoid it if someone phones you about placement at our facilities and demands that you make a cash payment first to skip the interview. “We don’t sell jobs, and those scammers can be reported to law enforcement.”
