RISING Gomora actor, Ntobeko Sishi, was Twitter’s favourite actor on Wednesday night, 6 January after acing a scene as Ntokozo. The scene was with Thembi Seete, who plays his mum Gladys and his love interest Mazet (Siphesihle Ndaba). Ntokozo recently ran away from home and Gladys was fetching him from Mazet’s house. That’s when he spoke out against his mum and stormed off to cry, which impressed viewers. His storyline has been trending lately, with people relating to him. His parents – Gladys and Melusi (Zolisa Xaluva) – have been neglecting him and paying attention to his friend Teddy (Sicelo Buthelezi). ALSO READ | WHEN CROWN FITS PERFECTLY!

He’s killing the Ntokozo role. Ntobeko Sishi is the tweet. Salute.” Another wrote: “#gomoramzansi Ntokozo is such a great actor. Yho! I felt that emotion. Goosebumps all over.” A third tweep said: “#gomoramzansi ladies and gentlemen I give you, Ntokozo. He deserves a standing ovation #Gomora #GomoraMzanzi.” The actor was recently nominated for Best Male Actor at the KZN Entertainment Awards on Tuesday, 15 December, but was beaten by The Queen’s SK Khoza. #gomoramzansi ladies and gentlemen I give you Ntokozo.
