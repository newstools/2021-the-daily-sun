SWALLOWS FC have blown a golden opportunity to return to the top of the DStv Premiership. This after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Chippa United at the Dobsonville Stadium yesterday. The defeat will feel more like a loss for Brandon Truter’s charges who were back at the summit of the log for the better part of the game. They let it slip, however, late in the match as they allowed the Chilli Boys to claw their way back into the match. As a result, the Dube Birds remain second on the log but equal with leaders Mamelodi Sundowns on 26 points. They will be encouraged, though, by the fact that they are still one of a handful of teams who are still unbeaten. They will have another opportunity to regain top spot when they meet the defending champions Sundowns at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (3 pm). The top of the table clash promises fireworks as both Downs and Swallows will be fighting it out for top spot. Swallows, who are playing in their first season back in the top flight after a lengthy spell in the lower tiers, have caught the eye this season. They have exceeded all expectations so far, constantly putting in impressive performances and enhancing their reputation. They looked to be well on their way to their eighth win of the season when their red-hot striker Ruzaigh Gamildien handed them an early lead against his former team. The 31-year-old bagged his ninth goal of the season and is now one behind the league’s top scorer Bradley Grobler who has 10. Chippa, however, are also a team on the rise under Dan “Dance” Malesela and they earned a deserved point through a Kurt Lentjies stunner.Chippa next face Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday (3.30 pm).
