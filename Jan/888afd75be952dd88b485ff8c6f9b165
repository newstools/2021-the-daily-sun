A MOTHER is expected to appear in court for the human trafficking and rape of her own daughter. The 53-year-old mum from Matiwaneskop area in Ladysmith, KZN, was arrested on Wednesday night, 13 January at her home. She will appear in the Ladysmith Magistrates Court on Frifday, 15 January. Her 15-year-old daughter, who is a grade 9 pupil, said she was raped by a known suspect at Elandslaagte in Matiwaneskop area and her mother was aware but took no action against the culprit. The girl’s mother allegedly took R100 from the suspect and gave it to her daughter to silence her. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbeke said on 1 December 2020, the girl’s mother had arranged for her to go visit a family friend in Joburg. Mbele said the girl was informed the family friend would buy her clothes, a cellphone and gold tooth. “When they arrived in Joburg she was introduced to some men known to this family friend. One of the men became known to her and he spoke a foreign language. This man allegedly raped her the whole night and in the morning he took her back to the family friend’s place,” said Mbele. Mbele said at the house the girl witnessed the man giving the family friend some money, which she then went into the house to count. “The girl was luckily rescued by two girls who actually know her from the Matiwaneskop area. They took her back home. When she arrived home she was scared to inform anyone about what had occurred to her,” said Mbele. She said the girl later gathered the courage to report the incident at Elandslagte Police Station and charges of human trafficking and rape were opened for investigation. “The investigation led to the arrest of the mother. She is expected to appear in court tomorrow (Friday),” said Mbele.
