A 71-YEAR-OLD sangoma from the Eastern Cape, who is accused of sexually assaulting boys and a girl aged between 13 and 18, is expected to face additional counts of sexual assault and compelled rape. The sangoma was arrested on Tuesday and has since been in custody after his formal bail application was remanded for Wednesday. He was arrested by the Motherwell family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit on charges of sexual assault and rape. Colonel Priscilla Naidu told Daily Sun that the suspect allegedly lured the boys and a girl to his house in Mgwalana Street, Motherwell NU6 on separate occasions or at the same time. “He informed the victims that he’d give them a belt for protection against evil spirits. When they went inside, he made them take off their clothes and caressed them with the belt. They further alleged that they became very disoriented, which was when he sexually molested them. “One victim reported the incident to his parents and since his arrest on Tuesday, three other cases have been opened against him – two for sexual assault and one charge of compelled rape,” said Naidu. Acting Mount Road cluster commander Brigadier Thandiswa Kupiso said: “Some of these healers are prominent figures in the community and held in high esteem by people. Acts such as these cannot be tolerated as they prey on the young and the innocent.”
