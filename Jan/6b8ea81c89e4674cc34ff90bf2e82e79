THE squad rotation policy has not only benefited Mamelodi Sundowns. But new recruits such as Mothobi Mvala, Khuliso Mudau and Kermit Erasmus have also been reaping rewards from the system which has yielded a glut of trophies for the Tshwane giants in recent years. For the sixth consecutive season, the Brazilians are in the Champions League group stages after they thumped Jwaneng Galaxy 5-1 on aggregate. They achieved victory while keeping one eye in the domestic DStv Premiership, where they next face Baroka FC on Saturday (3pm). But the Yellow Nation shouldn’t expect to see the same team that brushed aside the lowly Botswana side. “We are working on a lot of variations. We’ve managed to give quite a big number of players a chance to play and that is to build a base from which we can pick, also guided by the availability of players at times,” said co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi. “We are making sure that we have realistic depth and not just depth in numbers. You saw a completely different team against Orlando Pirates from what many anticipated. “We are trying to have a big squad that is practically helping us to win matches and not rely on 15 players.” Mvala was among the scorers in the 3-1 first-round return leg win on Tuesday. “When we brought Mvala we were hoping to get those goals because he chips in with five, six or eight goals in a season,” Mngqithi added. “He contributed immensely on set-pieces and with his drive into the box. We are just as exciting to see him not crumbling. “Most of the players who join Sundowns, when they are not getting game-time and they were key players in their teams, get disillusioned and lose focus. “He (Mvala) is a very good player for the Champions League and that’s the reason he was brought in. When you fight in Africa, you need soldiers.”
