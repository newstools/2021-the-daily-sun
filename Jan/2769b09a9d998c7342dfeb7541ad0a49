FORMER Maritzburg United coach Eric Tinkler will be appointed as the new coach of TS Galaxy on Monday. SunSport has learnt Tinkler, who was sacked by Maritzburg on 23 November last year, will replace Dan Malesela who recently joined Chippa United. When Malesela was sacked, Tim Sukazi’s club appointed Zipho Dlangalala as an interim coach. However, the former University of Pretoria coach couldn’t steady the ship. In two games Dlangalala has been in charge, Galaxy drew 2-2 with Baroka FC before being thrashed 3-0 by SuperSport United on Saturday. “Eric Tinkler is the new coach of TS Galaxy,” an insider said. Tinkler comes to the club that has not won in eight games. The club’s last win was against AmaZulu on 30 October. This has resulted in the Mpumalanga club being dragged into the relegation zone, lying 13 on the log table with eight points from ten games. They are just two points ahead of bottom-placed Black Leopards and 15th placed Chippa United and one ahead of 14th placed Kaizer Chiefs. Tinkler's first game in charge will be against Malesela’s Chippa at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday.
