FROM couples reporting each other for cheating to neighbours fighting, the Plastic View community office is full of surprises. And community leaders of the kasi in the east of Tshwane don’t mind resolving these issues. But they fear the office could be a Covid-19 super- spreader. Community leader, Benjamin Sithole (51), said residents usually come to the office without masks. “We keep telling residents to come to the office with their masks on, but it seems we’re talking to stones,” he said. “If residents can’t wear masks, I don’t think they sanitise or wash their hands frequently.” Sithole said most residents cry poverty when told to wear masks. “Most people here are poor, come from neighbouring countries and live from hand to mouth.” He said they needed to be educated. “We’re pleading for PPE donations and sanitisers,” he said. “Government must educate people about Covid-19. We don’t get the message because we don’t have electricity.” Sithole feared their kasi will become a hot spot. “People are still drinking beer in groups, going gambling the whole night, fighting and reporting it at the office,” he said. “If one person gets infected they’ll infect the whole squatter camp.” He said they’ll not be able to fight Covid-19 without donations. “We need masks and sanitisers, otherwise we’ll lose the fight against Covid-19. We’re really pleading for help,” he said.
