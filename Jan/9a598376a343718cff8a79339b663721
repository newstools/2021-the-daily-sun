YOUNG people whose only source of income is the R350 Covid-19 relief grant have warned President Cyril Ramaphosa of a possible crime outbreak when it stops. Youth in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape made the warning after it was confirmed that payments to people who didn’t qualify for social grants or UIF would expire at the end of January. The SunTeam spoke to Sipho Hlophe (28) and Banele Lwandiso (26) as they waited for their grants outside the post office at the beginning of the month. Sipho said they were angry that officials were making poor people stand in long queues, potentially exposing them to the virus. “There are no officials here to discipline people.” Banele said since the relief grant was introduced, crime had decreased in Mthatha and surrounding villages. “I’m not saying I’m going to steal people’s belongings, but it’s possible the majority of unemployed youth will join gangs if the president closes the tap,” he said. Banele survived on piece jobs before lockdown and had no option but to queue all day for the grant. “We don’t have any other option. We need this R350.” Eastern Cape Sassa spokesman, Luzuko Qina, confirmed that the relief grant would expire at the end of January. “So far, there are no changes and the R350 grant is coming to an end.”
