GOGO Nana Mtembu has been staying home to keep safe. Worried that people are losing their lives to the virus, she urged them to stop listening to critics and take the vaccine as soon as it became available. The 102-year-old gogo from Duduza in Ekurhuleni, born in 1918 during the time of the Spanish flu, believes Covid-19 can be conquered, just like that deadly flu. “I’ve lost a number of pastors and we wish this thing could go away,” she said. “Last year wasn’t a good year and this year is even worse. “I wish people could be vaccinated before we lose millions and millions of people.”  Gogo Nana, who recently became blind, said she stays indoors and people sanitise when they enter her house. “This corona kills. When churches open, most pastors I know won’t be there because they died,” she said. Gogo, a staunch member of the Zion Apostolic Church, has been eating healthy food, and this has kept her going. She prefers vegetables and chicken. Back in the day gogo used to take part in politics and would read a lot. “Now my eyes have stopped me from doing anything. But what can I do? It’s time,” she said. Gogo’s daughter, Beauty Mthembu, said her mum is very independent. “She bathes herself, but she now prefers using the basin rather than getting into the bath tub,” she said.
