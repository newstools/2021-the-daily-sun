Orlando Pirates academy graduate Azola Tshobeni’s eye-catching debut has left tongues wagging. The 18-year-old diminutive midfielder has been the talk of the town, receiving plenty of praise for his exploits in his first senior appearance. Tshobeni did not look out of place as he quietly went about his business in Pirates’ midfield against Maritzburg United at the weekend. “I am pleased with my debut,” Tshobeni told his club's website. “But more importantly, I am happy for the maximum points that we got on the day. “In terms of personal accolades, this is indeed a day to cherish for me and my family. Everyone has been waiting for my debut since my promotion to the Orlando Pirates first team, I am still in disbelief as I did not expect to make my debut so soon and not only that but to debut as a starter makes this occasion that more special. “When the whistle sounded at the start of the match, I was nervous. Even though the stadium was empty I knew everyone was watching from all corners of the country. It was nerve-wrecking at first, but I would like to thank my teammates for helping me settle. Their words of encouragement throughout the match helped me to play my football.”
