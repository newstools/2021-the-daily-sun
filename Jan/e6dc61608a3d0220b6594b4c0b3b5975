EASTERN Cape has lost another mayor, barely two weeks after Ingquza Hill mayor Bambezakhe Goya died following a short illness. Ngqushwa Mayor Nombuyiselo Magingxa is the second serving mayor to die in the province. ANC provincial secretary, Lulama Ngcukayitobi, confirmed that Magingxa died on Monday, 25 January in hospital after a short illness. “We’re shocked and saddened by the ultimate passing of Magingxa. She was an extraordinary activist of the ANC, whose leadership qualities were valued in the movement. “She served in various political responsibilities that the ANC assigned to her, including being a ward councillor and portfolio head for community and corporate services from 2006 to 2011 and took over the mayoral chain in 2020. “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Mangingxa family, her colleagues at Ngqushwa Local Municipality, friends and the entire community of Ngqushwa and Amathole regions. Her untimely passing is a huge blow to the municipality and the ANC given the strategic position she occupied as mayor.”
