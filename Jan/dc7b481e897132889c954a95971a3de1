Police in the Free State have 
arrested 42 people trying to enter the country illegally by crossing the
 Caledon River using a tube. According to police spokesperson 
Brigadier Motantsi Makhele the Bethlehem Public Order Policing (POP) 
Task Team were on Thursday deployed at the Ficksburg port of entry for 
"Safer Festive Season" operations, and to ensure full compliance and 
adherence to adjusted Level 3 Lockdown regulations. While they 
were patrolling the borderline and ports of entry near the Caledon 
River, they noticed a group of people crossing the border from Lesotho 
illegally over the river, using a tube. "Members kept observation 
and waited for them to cross into [sic] South African shores and 
arrested them. All 42 people were arrested as illegal immigrants 
entering the Republic of South Africa at a place other than port of 
entry," reads the statement. The suspects will appear in the Ficksburg Magistrate's court soon. - Compiled by Jan Gerber News24
