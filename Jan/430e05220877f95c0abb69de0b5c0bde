After years as a producer, award winner Mr Brown is making his own music. He’s released a new single, Thandolwami Nguwe featuring Zanda Zakuza and Makhadzi. Mr Brown, whose real name is Lynol Siwela, has produced some of South Africa’s biggest hits such as Master KG’s Skeleton Move and Makhadzi’s top charting Murahu, which won song of the year in four Mzansi radio stations. Speaking to SunBuzz about his new track, he said: “Although it’s a love song, one would expect it to be dedicated to someone special. “But the song was inspired by my fans and people who support me. It’s a token of my appreciation because when I was going through a lot, their support and love kept me going. “Working on the song was amazing. I worked with two musicians who love and respect their craft, and were ready to make my idea come to life.

I hope this year will be a little bit better.”
