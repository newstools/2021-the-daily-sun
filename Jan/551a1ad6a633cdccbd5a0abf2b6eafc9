THOSE who witnessed the Sharks’ revival a year ago would agree they deserve some reward for their effort. The Durbanites stormed out of the starting blocks, winning six of their seven Super Rugby matches, including three victories Down Under. But the Covid-19 outbreak put paid to their campaign as the tournament was subsequently suspended. No doubt they would have gone on to make the playoffs, such was their ever-improving performance under Sean Everitt. A lot has changed since then but they are not in the Super Rugby Unlocked, the Carling Currie Cup, by fluke. They face the Bulls at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. “I’m very happy that the players are going to have the opportunity to play in a final. Super Rugby last year is long gone,” said Everitt. “I feel that we aren’t playing as well as we did back then. I’m exceptionally happy for the guys, for the effort they put in during a difficult and challenging season.” Everitt knows they will be up against it in Pretoria and has pointed to the Bulls powerful forwards pack led by Duane Vermeulen as the challenge they face. “The Bulls forwards have always been dominant as a pack,” he said. “They are a powerful unit. They can mix up their game well with counter-attacks and they play well from turnovers. It all comes from pressure at breakdown. "Marco van Staden and Duane Vermeulen have been huge in that area. The Bulls have shown they are the form side. They are going to be a massive challenge up at Loftus.” The Bulls won the Super Rugby Unlocked title and topped the Currie Cup round-robin log, leading up to their 26-21 win over the Lions in Saturday’s semi-final. They scored most points as they won the most matches since. But they also know it won’t be a stroll in the park on Saturday.
