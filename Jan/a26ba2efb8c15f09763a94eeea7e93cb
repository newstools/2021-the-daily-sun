Kearyn Baccus wants Kaizer Chiefs to use this busy period to move up the DStv Premiership table with the games coming thick and fast the opportunity for points not to be missed. Chiefs have played four matches in the last two weeks, taking 10 points from a possible 12, and have two more before the end of January, starting on Tuesday with a home clash against Baroka FC, and then the short trip to the Orlando Stadium for the Soweto Derby on Saturday. After a dismal start to the season, Chiefs are suddenly just 10 points behind the stuttering leaders. “Everyone is looking at the log every week, things are changing day-in and day-out, because there are a lot of games – Tuesday, Saturday, Tuesday, Saturday," Baccus said. "So, you know things are changing quickly but we're not really concentrating too much on that, we just need to concentrate on ourselves and getting results, and the rest is [out of our control]. We can't worry about people outside of us in other clubs." Baccus admits too that there will be an element of revenge for Chiefs when they face Baroka – the Limpopo club denied them the league title on the final day of last season when they held the AmaKhosi to a 1-1 draw. "You know they ended up beating [sic] us last season in the last game, which was disappointing. “So, I think we've got a little bit of, how do I say, disappointment and hurt, which we need to take into this game and use it to help us to drive and battle, and hopefully get a win." -SuperSport
