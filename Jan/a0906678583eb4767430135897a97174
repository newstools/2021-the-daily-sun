WITH Mzansi having moved to lockdown alert level 3, booze has once again been banned. Now drinkers find themselves drinking just about anything to get drunk. Some make their own booze, while others buy booze behind closed doors. Sipho Ntshangase is one of those who bought booze behind closed doors. He bought what’s believed to be a bottle of gin, but he sadly died on Friday, after drinking it. His twin brother, Jabu, said Sipho started to drink this gin after booze was banned. But they were surprised as he got thinner and thinner. “When I asked him about the sudden weight loss, he told me the hot stuff was burning him in the stomach. “Nevertheless, he continued to drink and sometimes diluted it,” said Jabu. However, the 41-year-old from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, said his brother wasn’t breathing when he went to check on him on Friday morning. “I tried to wake him up, but he was motionless. I called an ambulance and he was certified dead by paramedics,” he said. Jabu said he was devastated by his brother’s death. “He was the only family member left. Our parents died some years ago, and we were the only ones left. “I don’t know how I’m going to cope now that he’s gone,” he said. Jabu said he and Sipho were so close they used to wear the same outfits. “We were famous for that,” he said. To make matters worse, Jabu is unemployed and doesn’t have money to bury his brother. Fuming residents called on the police to arrest those who sell booze behind closed doors. “Jabu isn’t the first person to die from this concocted gin. These people must be stopped,” said a resident. Police spokesman Captain Piet Rossouw said a preliminary investigation was done and a post-mortem will be done to determine the cause of death.
