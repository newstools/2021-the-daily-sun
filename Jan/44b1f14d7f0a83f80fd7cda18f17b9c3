VETERAN defender Clayton Daniels says he’s settling in at Maritzburg United. Daniels, who was released by SuperSport United recently and quickly snapped up by the Team of Choice, has played twice for his new club and helped them with both games and move away from the relegation zone. He was key in the 2-0 win over Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium last Saturday. Maritzburg coach Ernst Middendorp said Daniels was the missing link in the side after the departure of their inspirational captain and goalkeeper Richards Ofori to Orlando Pirates during the off season. Despite things looking good on the pitch, Daniels is still searching for a place to live. Since moving to Pietermaritzburg he has been forced to share an apartment. “On the field, things are looking good. But off the field, I’m still working on it (getting new accommodation),” said Daniels. “But I’m happy with the guys because we have picked up six points but there is still it is a very long way to go.” For the first time this season, Maritzburg will be looking to get their third league win on the bounce after beating Celtic and Chiefs when they visit AmaZulu at Jonsson Kings Park on Sunday (3.30pm). Daniels says they are treating the Kwa-Zulu Natal derby just like any other game, where he’s set to battle it out with Usuthu’s powerful striker Bongi Ntuli. “It is an opportunity to give our best if we follow the instructions of the coach I think we can be successful on Sunday,” he said. Daniels says he is impressed with the professionalism at the club. He knows Middendorp well having played under the German coach at Bloemfontein Celtic from October 2013 until December 2014. “I’m very happy with my decision to come here even although I had other offers but as I know some of the players and the coach, who insisted on me coming here, it was an easy decision to make,” said the former Mamelodi Sundowns defender. “When Ernst called me, having worked with him before, I knew what I was getting myself into.”
