a Cape Town man accused of robbery was bust in Mpumalanga on Tuesday 26 January after five years of dodging cops. Sipho Motha (42) allegedly conned someone of around R150 000 before he disappeared into thin air. Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said Motha has been on the run since May 2015. “The dedicated team spent sleepless nights ensuring that the suspect is brought to book. “It is alleged that in June 2014, the suspect allegedly posed as a truck dealer and received approximately R150 000 from a business owner who needed a truck for business purposes. The victim travelled from Western Cape to Johannesburg to fetch the heavy-duty vehicle which was never received,” said Sekgotodi. A case was reported at a Cape Town cop shop and he had been sought until the information was received that he was hiding in Mpumalanga. He was arrested on Tuesday, 26 January 2021 in Barberton following a search by the Hawks. “Motha briefly appeared in the Barberton Magistrates Court today and was remanded in custody. He is expected to appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court in Cape Town on 2 February 2021,” said Sekgotodi.
