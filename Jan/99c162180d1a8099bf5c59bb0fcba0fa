THE Caf Confederation Cup journey has ended for Bloemfontein Celtic. Siwelele bowed out of the continental tourney after they went down 3-0 (5-0 on aggregate) to Rivers United at Charles de Gaulle Stadium in Benin on Saturday. First-half goals from Godwin Aguda and one from Fortune Omoniwari in the second half sunk the Free State side in front of empty stands in Benin. With the odds stacked heavily against them, Celtic faced an even bigger task trying to overturn a 2-0 goal deficit in a neutral venue. Losing the first leg of the first round at home, it was always going to be a mammoth task for a team without the experience on the continent. The fixture was initially postponed as Celtic could not travel to Nigeria due to the strict Covid-19 regulations set by the Nigerian government, which declined a request for a quarantine waiver for the Celtic travelling contingent. CAF then acceded to the request by Nigeria Football Federation, on behalf of Rivers, to have the game rescheduled and staged in a neighbouring country to Nigeria “with more lenient Covid-19 protocols”. Going to Porto-Novo, there was a glimmer of hope that the South African could cause an upset. But it wasn't to be. Siwelele are expected back home on Monday.
