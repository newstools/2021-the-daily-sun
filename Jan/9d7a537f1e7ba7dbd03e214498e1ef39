Eastern Cape police have 
uncovered a land theft syndicate illegally selling plots on government 
farms near the East London Airport. Five suspects - aged between 38 and 62 - were arrested on Wednesday following a week-long covert police investigation. Eastern
 Cape police spokesperson Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana said they had 
allegedly been selling plots on farms belonging to the Department of 
Public Works for R15 000 in 2020. The suspects later increased the price to R20 000 in January. Kinana
 said involved in the intelligence-led operation was the Crime 
Intelligence Coastal police, Commercial Crimes detectives, Public Works 
and Infrastructure Investigation Section and Asset Forfeiture unit of 
the Hawks, National Intelligence Unit and Visible Policing officers. The suspects are expected to appear in the East London Magistrate's Court on Friday and will be charged with fraud. Kinana
 said: "During the operation, an undisclosed amount of money was 
recovered, including two vehicles believed to have been used by the 
suspects during the commission of the crimes. All the suspects will be 
charged for fraud and other charges may be added as the investigation 
progresses." "According to the information, this group of suspects
 was identified selling plots illegally to people. Reports suggest that 
the group were selling theses plots for R15 000 each up to the 31st 
December 2020 and increased to R20 000 per plot from January 2021. From 
2021-01-20 to 2021-01-27 covert police observations and investigations 
ensued, which resulted to the arrest of the suspects on Wednesday..." News24
