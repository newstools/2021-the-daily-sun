IZANGOMA from the Traditional Healers Organisation (THO) in Cape Town lit candles in honour of their leader Phepsile Maseko. Maseko died of Covid-19-related complications last week, and the izangoma gathered at Site B in Khayelitsha a few days after they received news of her death. THO chairman Sandile Hlope told Daily Sun that they wanted to bid farewell to Maseko in Mpumalanga, but Covid-19 regulations only allowed 50 people at funerals. “I was devastated when I heard about the death of our leader because I did not know she was sick. “We were all shocked. We decided to have a small gathering to show respect to our great leader who contributed immensely to our cause,” said Hlope. Sangoma Phumla Mojani said: “She stood for traditional leaders and for us to be recognised in Parliament. “We are saying to the family, they are not the only ones who are at a loss, but the country as a whole. “We have suffered a big blow, and hope to get another leader who will take us forward.” Another sangoma, Thabo Nangawuza, said: “We believe that even if gogo Phepsile is no longer with us, her spirit will lead the way. We have lost a person who was our torchbearer. It is very difficult to accept that she is dead.” Maseko was an ardent advocate of traditional medicine and ran her own company, Phephisa Natural Resources Institute, that created pharmaceutical products using traditional medicine.
