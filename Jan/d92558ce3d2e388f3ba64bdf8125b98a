A 3.9 magnitude earthquake hit the Klerksdorp area in North West on Friday night, the Council for Geoscience said. Spokesperson Mahlatse Mononela said it struck at around 20:23 to the east of Klerksdorp. Residents, who took to Twitter, described it as strong. Further information was not immediately available. Last year, a series of quakes shook parts of the country, including Cape Town. The council has a form that can be completed by people who felt the quake to help them pinpoint the effect it had. https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/39-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-klerksdorp-20210109
