RESIDENTS of Lower Crossroads say rubbish collection has become a nightmare for them. Bavuyise Gwinta (39) from the kasi in Philippi East, Cape Town, said they put their bins out every Wednesday and return to find them gone or still full. He said the problem was made worse by the fact that thugs stole their bins because they were on the street all day. “Sometimes rubbish collectors come but only at about 9pm and by then, many bins have been taken,” he said. Another resident said there was a time when the bins were only collected at 10pm when everyone was already inside. “We can’t go back out at that time because we will be followed by criminals and they’ll rob us,” said the resident. Kholekile Sigonyela (40) said they couldn’t keep replacing bins. “There are days when they don’t come at all or come the following day when the bins aren’t out. If there are changes, they have to alert us,” said Kholekile. City of Cape Town water and waste MMC Xanthea Limberg said the city was experiencing delays due to maintenance of solid waste vehicles. “This is causing delays in both formal refuse collection as well as area cleaning services in several suburbs across the city,” she said. Limberg said teams were attending to the backlog and Lower Crossroads would be serviced. “If there’s a delay, refuse should please be taken out every day until the truck comes back. Bins in all areas will be emptied by each Sunday,” said Limberg. She said every effort was being made to make sure rubbish was collected on the scheduled day, but if it was not possible, residents should bring their bins in at 9pm and put them back out at 6am. “If it’s not collected on the scheduled day, rubbish will generally be collected the following day,” she said.
