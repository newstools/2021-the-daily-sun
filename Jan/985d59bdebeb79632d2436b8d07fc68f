GOGO Nonkoliseko Satu lost everything in a fire that burnt down more than 100 shacks and 10 brick houses on New Year’s Day. The 61-year-old from Taiwan in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, said she was devastated. “I used my pension money to build my home. No one assisted me, not even government,” she said. The gogo said no one knew who started the fire, but there were rumours a jealous woman was trying to burn down her boyfriend’s shack. “That’s what happens in this squatter camp. No one takes the blame,” she said. “Some people say the fire started in a shack while the owners weren’t even home. I don’t know what the truth is, but this fire caused huge damage.” The gogo, who retired in 2019, said she spent all her money building her house. “I worked at the airport for 30 years,” she said. Her son Bonke said losing their home was the most painful thing that had ever happened to them. “We saw our mother struggling to build the house, and when she was finally done this fire happened,” he said. “How could people be so careless. What now? We lost our jobs during lockdown.” The family pleaded with SunLanders to donate windows and cement bags. “We need a lot of things to rebuild this house. We need assistance from anyone. We can’t do this on our own.” Bonke said if it wasn’t for lockdown, they could have easily fixed their house. “Times are tough and we need help. We got affected by this fire because our house was close to the source and there was a strong wind,” he said.
