MASKANDI star Khuzani “King Khuba” Mpungose has made his mark in Mzansi. He’s had a successful career and won several awards, defeating many big names. He’s won Samas, Satmas and recently almost one million votes were cast for his song Ijele in Ukhozi FM’s Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka contest. Khuzani from Nkandla, KZN, now wants to conquer the USA. He told SunBuzz his biggest wish is to win a Grammy award. “Winning many competitions in Mzansi has made me realise I should enter competitions overseas to compete with international musicians. “I’d like to thank Mzansi people for supporting me in many competitions, and I feel I’m done with Mzansi competitions. “I’ve won all competitions and awards and filled up Moses Mabhida Stadium at an event that was attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa. I need tougher competition across the world.” ALSO READ | DJ HLO TOPS CHARTS He said beating his rival, Mthandeni “Igcokama Elisha” Manqele, as well as Big Zulu – whose track Imali Eningi is making waves across the country – made it clear he has no competition in Mzansi. “I’ve defeated maskandi artists and defeated artists from other music genres to show them I’m not defeating maskandi musicians only.” “Mthandeni normally runs away when he’s competition against me, and comes and says he can defeat me. At the KZN Entertainment Awards, where I won, he withdrew his nomination and ran away because he was scared of me.”
