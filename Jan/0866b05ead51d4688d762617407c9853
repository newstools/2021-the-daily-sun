RESIDENTS, especially in the eastern parts of Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KZN, are warned of tropical cyclone Eloise approaching South Africa. South African Weather Service forecaster Surprise Mhlongo told the SunTeam Eloise has left Madagascar already and could hit Mzansi on Sunday 24 January. He said it’s expected to be in Mozambique on Friday 22 January. The weather service said widespread flooding, damage to roads and bridges, as well as displacement of communities in low-lying areas are possible. “This is a similar weather system to the one that brought a lot of damages over the eastern parts of Limpopo in the year 2000. “This tropical cyclone is expected to affect the eastern parts of Limpopo and the northern parts of Mpumalanga and KZN, which could lead to heavy rain, flooding and strong winds over these areas especially from Sunday 24 January to Tuesday 26 January,” said Mhlongo.’
