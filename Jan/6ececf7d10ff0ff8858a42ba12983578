History tells us it takes years to develop a vaccine. For example, it took scientists more than 60 years to develop the polio vaccine. We’re still waiting for the HIV/Aids vaccine. But it only took less than a year for them to develop the Covid-19 vaccine. It makes you think, huh? Our government is purchasing a vaccine from their Brics friends. India, of all places. It would be wise to test their friends’ vaccine on themselves first – politicians, followed by nosey scientists who think they’re above God. That way, if something goes wrong with their Indian vaccine, we won’t lose anything of value. Our hardworking and valuable health workers will be safe.
