THE Bulls will battle it out with the Sharks for Carling Currie Cup honours. The two rugby powerhouses earned themselves spots in the final through respective wins against the Lions and Western Province on Saturday. The Bulls edged ambitions Lions 26-21 in a semifinal clash of characterised by a litany of errors, breaks in play and yellow cards at Loftus Versfeld. Strevino Jacobs scored two tries, but yellows cards to locks Willem Alberts and Marvin Orie, for professional fouls proved costly. The sin bins took the wind out of the Lions sails, but their Joburg side stood no chance against the Bulls whose game-management, discipline and composure proved decisive. They will contest a rare Currie Cup final when they host the Sharks, who beat Province 19-9 at Newlands Stadium. The Western Cape side bid their Newlands home farewell, losing in their last match at the Cape rugby bastion. But it wasn’t a swansong John Dobson had hoped for as Siya Kolisi’s team lacked the edge against the Durbanites. The Sharks defence held out and refused to yield under pressure from the home side, who kept grinding out at the try line. JJ van der Mescht got the drive over the line from close range off the back of the ruck and Curwin Bosch made no mistake with the boot, slotting in the conversion as well as the extra to ensure the visitors get home.
