BOOZERS say they can’t be blamed for the rapid spread of Covid-19. So they want the alcohol ban lifted. Speaking to Daily Sun, they said coronavirus cases still continued to rise despite the ban. Phillip Mathonsi (36) said: “I think government is playing games with us. At first they said we will experience a rise in the number of infections during winter because of the cold. Now that winter is gone, they are coming with other excuses for the second wave. And this time they have put the blame on alcohol.”  He said he went back to home-brewed beer as he couldn’t quit drinking. “We hope President Cyril Ramaphosa will lift the ban when he addresses us next week,” said Phillip. Sebamba Kekana (62) said alcohol was not the cause of the second wave.  “We continue to see cases rise since the ban of alcohol sales was announced. This clearly proves that alcohol was never the cause. “Government should just allow alcohol takeaways and ban sit-ins. A vaccine is needed urgently and government should stop blaming drinkers,” he said. Philani Maseko (29) said he feared government would also ban cigarette sales.  “Cigarettes don’t have any impact on the virus. All these bans are meant to make us suffer and destroy the economy. I will fully support any organisation and businesses, including SAB that challenge government and take them to court,” he said. Meke Mogotlo (29) said government should allow alcohol sales and introduce a 6pm curfew.  “Thereafter, send soldiers to patrol. This will ensure law and order in the streets.” On Wednesday, 6 January, the South African Breweries announced it would approach courts to challenge the alcohol ban. The SAB said it supported measured alcohol restrictions, but strongly disagreed with the ban. On New Year’s eve, Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital announced that its trauma unit was empty for the first time in history under the amended lockdown level three.
