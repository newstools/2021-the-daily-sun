  Gauteng police commissioner Elias Mawela said this was the second successful New Year's Eve operation in Hillbrow. Mawela
 and his subordinates tightened their boots and hit the ground running 
in the notorious part of Johannesburg on Thursday night. In the 
past, Hillbrow was synonymous with extreme violence, with many people 
being injured and its streets littered with garbage, furniture, rocks 
and stones, burning tyres and other items, such as fridges, thrown from 
windows. Different scene This year, 
however, the suburb was a different scene, except for a few broken 
bottles and other small items on the streets. This has been attributed 
to lockdown regulations and constant police visibility. A handful of people were seen roaming the streets, but on seeing the police convoy, they quickly dashed into properties. Many homeless people were seen sleeping under blankets, with only a few awake. In many streets, police were greeted with whistles, vuvuzelas and ululation from residents applauding their presence. Mawela said the operation was a success thanks to the cooperation of residents and their leaders. 'Mission accomplished'
