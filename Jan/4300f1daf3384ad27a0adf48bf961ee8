SHE knew she was about to die at the hands of her man. So she called her mum to tell her that her husband had threatened to kill her. Her mum then called her brother, who rushed to his sister’s aid. But he was too late as he found his sister strangled and the suspect nowhere to be found. The suspect was found the following day hanging from a tree in the bush in Nigel, Ekurhuleni. Thabiso Mokoena (34) said when he got to the couple’s shack in Alra Park, it was locked. “I knocked several times, but there was no answer,” he said He then went home to inform his mum Malefu (55), who told him to force the door open. Thabiso said he almost fainted when he saw his sister Mmamokete (31) lying dead on the bed with wounds on her neck. “I’m deeply hurt. I am devastated by my sister’s death, which left a void in the family,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said upon investigation, they noticed a deep scratch around Mmamokete’s neck, showing she was strangled. “There was no one was in the shack and the husband was nowhere to be found,” said Ramphora. He said the search for the husband Mandla Dlamini (41) ensued. “Some residents claimed they saw him leaving the place, but didn’t know where he was. We are told he was allegedly seen with a wire in his possession and was threatening to go kill himself,” he said. Ramphora said the police searched for him but with no luck. He said Mandla was found hanging from a tree by a passerby, who contacted the police. Neighbours told Daily Sun what the man did was sad as he has now left the kids without parents. “We’re really shocked and saddened,” said a neighbour. Murder and inquest dockets were opened at Nigel Police Station. The couple had been together for about 10 years and they left behind three kids.
