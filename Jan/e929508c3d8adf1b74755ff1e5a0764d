Most people don’t know that sangomas also run specials. They think it only happens in the supermarkets. But Daily Sun met Khanyisa “Dudulutshaba” Mtini, a sangoma from Langa township in Cape Town who running a 40% special on all her services. She said the idea of having a special came after a candlelight prayer she did on the 1 January. “In my prayer I asked my ancestors and God what I should do and the answer was that I must drop my prices so that people can be healed,” said Dudulutshaba. The specials started at the beginning of January and will end at the end of February. “The special includes consultations and cleansings, everything is 40% off. I am happy that my clients are taking this opportunity as it is not something that happens often,” she said. She said she understands that most people lost their jobs in 2020. “We all know what the lockdown did to most people. We can’t charge them a lot of money because we are not doing this for money but to heal them,” said Dudulutshaba. She said some people don’t understand how sangomas have specials. “People need to move with the times. A lot of things are changing. All we need to do is move with the times as long as the job is being done.” The specials are also her way of giving back to the community. “I don’t have money to give them but I can heal them by dropping the prices.” Luyolo Ndabeni (45) said there is nothing wrong with sangomas having specials. “They are dealing with money so they are doing the right thing by having these specials. We must remember that people still want to be healed even though they don’t have money. They are doing a great thing,” said Luyolo. Nosisa Siko (36) said she doesn’t understand how sangomas work. “Things have really changed. It is the first time I hear of a sangoma giving specials. I wonder what they are going to do next? But as long as they are doing their job, it’s fine,” said Nosisa.
