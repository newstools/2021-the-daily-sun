ACTOR Hungani Ndlovu is not making a comeback on Scandal! The popular e.tv drama has poured cold water on the claims that the talented actor is making a comeback on the show after producers agreed to a new salary range. “Guess who’s returning to Scandal! Sooner than we expected, Scandal! has officially offered Hungani Ndlovu R85 000 to R100 000 to return to the show, making him one of the highest paid actors in SA,” Mzansi Celeb News wrote. One of the show’s producers Sanele Zulu told Daily Sun the rumours were untrue. “Any rumours regarding Hungani Ndlovu either resigning or returning to Scandal! due to salary issues are false,” he said. “Last year, Hungani requested to go on leave for personal reasons which have no bearing on Scandal! whatsoever. Our relationship with Hungani has always been extremely positive and remains so until so to this day.” ALSO READ | UZALO ACTOR TESTS POSTIVE FOR COVID-19 This is the second time rumours regarding the actor’s future on the show have surfaced.
