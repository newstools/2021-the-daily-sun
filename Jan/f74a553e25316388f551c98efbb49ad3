Paying tribute to his colleagues, Netcare Group CEO Dr Richard Friedland said: “We’re here today to bear testimony to the lives of these great human beings, to continue their unfinished legacy of healing and bringing hope. “At this hallowed site, their heroic and remarkable lives were cut short and a gaping hole remains. We’ll never be able to adequately articulate the magnitude of this loss, nor make sense of it, and yet we’re left with that impossible task as we reach out our arms to you, their loved ones, in hope and comfort.  “Our hearts are broken, we mourn the loss of these fallen heroes, these front line workers who have given so selflessly, so courageously of themselves. Our hearts are shattered for you, their families, children, loved ones, friends and colleagues whom they have left behind.”
