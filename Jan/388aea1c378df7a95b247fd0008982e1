THE CRL Commission sat yesterday to listen to allegations against Bishop Stephen Zondo. But a senior pastor came out with guns blazing to defend him. Pastor Lydia Malete of Rivers of Living Waters Ministries rubbished allegations by her niece Bongi Mofokeng that Zondo had raped her. She said Mofokeng was making up stories. Last month, Mofokeng told the commission that Zondo raped her at a hotel in the south of Joburg, and told her that she’d die if she told anyone about it. She said she told a relative and shortly thereafter, her mother and sister died in an accident she was also involved in. Malete told the commission that Mofokeng had told her the same story about being raped before she joined the church, but the accusation was made against a businessman she slept with to get her driving licence. “The story Mofokeng told about Zondo is the same one she told me about the businessman. If Mofokeng told me she was raped by Zondo, I would have confronted him,” she said. When the commissioners asked Malete about marriages being wrecked at the church, she said divorces happened like with any other congregation. “Zondo should be treated as innocent until proven guilty. To this day, there’s no proof of him raping people. If this was true, he should be behind bars,” she said. “We’re still here but there’s no proof to the allegations. Why are we still here?” Last month, Malete failed to stop public hearings into allegations of impropriety at the church in the South Gauteng High Court.
