PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has closed 20 land ports of entry. But the closures of borders between South Africa and Lesotho has seen an influx of illegal immigrants making their way into Mzansi at all costs. Many illegal immigrants were using old bed mattresses with tubeless tyres to cross over the Caledon River between Ficksburg and Lesotho on a daily basis. South Africans who live near the illegal route in Ficksburg blamed government for not sending enough soldiers to stop the illegal crossing, especially at this stage where borders closed due to Covid-19 level 3 regulations. A resident told Daily Sun that they were vulnerable to infection as they always crossed paths with those immigrants, who were likely not tested. “About 50 Basotho people cross the river into SA daily. It is pointless to close the Ficksburg border as many Basotho use their own way to enter, although some end up dying while trying to cross the overflowing Caledon. The situation is worse.” However, Free State police said they had arrested 129 Lesotho nationals who were trying to forcefully cross the borders at Caledonspoort port. Free State police commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane warned those who tried to cross now, when the province was experiencing heavy rains. “It is unfortunate that some of the people who tried to cross into SA illegally died in the river. “We want send a stern warning to those who are still continuing with these illegal activities that they will face the full might of the law. “It is important to adhere to all prescriptions of adjusted level 3 regulations,” she said
