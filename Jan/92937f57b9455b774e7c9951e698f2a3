Prolonged level 3 lockdown means poverty is going to torment us well into the unforeseeable future. In hard times such as these, we need to be mentally and emotionally strong. If we fail to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and keeping the pandemic’s effects at bay, suicides might rise. Living in poverty, with no hope the situation will improve, can make you feel worthless. Feelings of rejection and believing that your problems are too big to handle make one lose interest in living. Suicide is not the solution. No matter what you’re going through, you can overcome it as long as you’re alive and healthy. Don’t focus on a problem but rather on solving it. To remain positive, try to work on a solution. Watch comedies on your phone or on TV. And socialise with positive people who’ll comfort you. Avoid those who judge you. Learn how other people with similar problems are coping. Bear in mind that you’re not alone in these difficult times. You’re unique and have a special role to play in making the world better.
