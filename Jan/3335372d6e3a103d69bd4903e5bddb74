Covid-19 has spoiled people’s plans to tie the knot on Robben Island on Valentine’s Day next month. The cancellation of the mass weddings this year came after the recent announcement by Home Affairs Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi on the temporary suspension of applications for IDs, passports and marriage services. In a statement by the Robben Island Museum said: “Due to the increasing numbers of Department of Home Affairs staff testing positive for Covid-19, the annual historic Robben Island Valentine’s Day weddings are unfortunately cancelled for 2021.” Couples from all over Mzansi would normally flock to the historic island dressed in their best suits and wedding dresses to tie the knot. This year would have marked 21 years of celebrating love on the island. “Last year 19 couples tied the knot with a historic milestone of Mr Frankford Williams and Cindi Mullins, who are visually impaired, officially being the first couple in South Africa to receive their marriage certificate in braille,” said the museum. In the past 20 years, 327 couples have tied the knot on the island as a partnership between the museum and Home Affairs. The weddings were first initiated by the late Martha Mgxashe, former regional director at the Home Affairs, with the first marriage ceremony held on 31 December 2000 as part of the Millennium Celebrations. In 2001, the ceremony was moved to Valentine’s Day to promote the significance of Robben Island. The museum said they’d look at the possibility of hosting the weddings at a later stage, should conditions allow with the easing of Covid-19 regulations.
