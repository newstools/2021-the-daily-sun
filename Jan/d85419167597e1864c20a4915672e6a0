A TWIST on reality TV show Mnakwethu Happily Ever After surprised viewers on Wednesday, 20 January. This after maskandi artist Dulas Magubane introduced a potential third wife to his two partners, Sheila Dlamini and Zinhle Mhlongo. The two partners were introduced in the first season. MaDlamini is the first wife and MaMhlongo is still a girlfriend. Dulas introduced Zinhle Shozi, the mother of his one-year-old daughter. But asked about Zinhle in the first two episodes, Dulas denied their relationship. So he took viewers by surprise when he introduced her as his girlfriend. MaDlamini and MaMhlongo said they were leaving Dulas after the revelation, something they’d been talking about since the beginning of the second season.

I didn’t plan to introduce MaShozi to MaDlamini and MaMhlongo on the show, but it happened,” said Dulas. “Another thing that didn’t go as planned is my separation from MaDlamini. We’re no longer together. Sometimes when you’re with someone you think you know them, only to learn new things and realise you don’t know them at all. Something similar happened to MaDlamini and I.” He said he was still with MaMhlongo and MaShozi. “They get along better compared to how they were at the beginning. “I’m trying to get them to get along even better, and encourage them to call each other and chat.” The artist said he’d made arrangements to marry the two women, but they had to wait because of the pandemic.
