ANC and EFF members protested outside court yesterday to oppose bail for a 34-year-old man accused of two murders. The boyfriend of murdered miner Rose Vilakazi (32) and her 17-month-old daughter Accurate was appearing in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court, Mpumalanga. The burnt remains of Vilakazi and her daughter were found inside her white BMW, under a railway bridge in Ronaldsey Village, on Christmas Eve. Vilakazi apparently visited her boyfriend in the Kruger National Park when she was home for Christmas. She never returned. Prosecutor Mavis Mashimbyi told the court the charges the accused is facing are serious. Defence lawyer Vusi Segodi said Difference Tiwane planned to plead not guilty. “The case against my client is weak, and he’s not going to plead guilty. Police found nothing in his possession,” said Segodi. “Police forced him to make a confession. My client is employed by Impala Platinum Mine in North West. “He’s a responsible father of three kids from different mothers. He has a pending assault case against him in Rustenburg.” Magistrate Nhlanhla Malomane warned the accused that all evidence given to the court could be used against him. Vilakazi family spokesman, Patrick Mbowane (55), said: “Our wish is that he’s not granted bail.” Provincial ANC Women’s League secretary, Lydia Moroane, told the People’s Paper: “President Cyril Ramaphosa must take decisive steps to save the lives of women and children. No GBV or femicide case must be withdrawn.” The EFF’s Trevor Nkosi demanded a fair trial and judgment. The matter was postponed until Friday, 8 January.
