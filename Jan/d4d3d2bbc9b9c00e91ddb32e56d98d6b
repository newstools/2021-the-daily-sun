SANDILE Hlope of the Traditional Healers Organisation has cautioned Mzansi to take the second Covid-19 wave seriously. The healer from Khayelitsha in Cape Town warned people not to make cops force them to wear masks. “I don’t understand why people expect government to arrest them for not protecting their own lives. “You only live once, so you need to be careful and protect yourself.” He was still in shock following the death of their leader Phepsile Maseko, who apparently died of Covid-19 complications. “The second wave is dangerous. Sometimes people who show no symptoms go to bed and never wake up. “People must do what government says. Wear your mask, have a sanitiser in your house and ensure your kids are following regulations.” If parents didn’t ensure kids were wearing masks and sanitising, they’d bring the virus back home. “It’s pointless for you to wear a mask if your child goes to the streets to play without wearing one,” he said. He urged Mzansi to fight Covid-19 using traditional remedies such as umhlonyane and steaming. On Monday, Mzansi recorded over 15 000 new cases of Covid-19, and 416 deaths. The total number of Covid-19 cases recorded in Mzansi is at about 1,2 million, with cumulative deaths of 33 579. KZN, Gauteng, Western Cape and the Eastern Cape have the highest number of new and active cases. On Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa urged citizens to avoid the three Cs: closed spaces, crowded placses and close contact.
