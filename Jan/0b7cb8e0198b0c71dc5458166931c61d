HE stole the sheep and took them for a ride in a taxi. But the stolen livestock wouldn’t keep quiet and cops at a road block became suspicious when they heard the bleating of the animals. The police investigated the Toyota Quantum taxi and the enclosed trailer. They found themselves looking at 18 noisy sheep! Captain Solomon Sibiya said the two suspects were caught in the early hours of Saturday by Rand West police. Sibiya said the remarkable scene led to the arrest of a 59-year-old suspect and his son (18) on the R41 road near Azaadville. Sibiya said police were there to make sure motorists complied with the curfew. A white Toyota Quantum with an Eastern Cape registration number was temporarily converted to a panel van as the seats were removed to load the suspected stolen sheep.  “The suspect informed police he was hired to deliver the sheep by someone in Swaneville, but he didn’t have any proof of purchase,” said Sibiya. He was placed under arrest and later detained at Kagiso cop shop. A stock theft case was opened against the suspect and his son. “Police will add charges of non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions,” said Kagiso cop shop commander, Brigadier Themba Maduna. The suspects are expected to appear in court soon.
