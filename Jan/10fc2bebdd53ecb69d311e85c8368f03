Eastern Cape police have arrested two people for the possession of drugs worth around R7 000. The 31-year-old and 29-year-old suspects were arrested in Somerset East on Thursday, said police spokesperson Captain Bradley Rawlinson. The arrests were made after police received a tip-off about two houses where drugs were allegedly being sold. "On Thursdayâ€¦ at 14:50, Somerset East Crime Prevention held an information-driven operation to Aeroville Residential area, after receiving information of two houses that allegedly sold drugs," he said. When police arrived at the addresses, search warrants were presented to the owners and the houses were searched. The search yielded a cache of drugs, said Rawlinson. "A total of 132 mandrax tablets with the street value of R 7 000 were confiscated." The suspects are due to appear in Somerset East Magistrate's Court soon on charges of drug possession.
