POLICE are searching for a man who gave a woman hell for leaving her four-year-old son in the back seat of her car. The wanted suspect had stolen the car on Saturday morning from the meat market in Beaverton, Oregon USA. It’s alleged the woman had left the engine of her car running and doors unlocked before going inside for a few minutes to buy meat and milk. That was enough time for the suspect to get in the car and drive off, but little did he know there was a child in the back seat. When the suspect saw the child, he returned to the mother and reprimanded her. He threatened to call the police on her and then drove away in her car, Beaverton police spokesman Officer Matt Henderson told CNN. “He hopped in the car, drove it and later realised there was a four-year-old inside. He then drove back and ordered the woman to take the child out of the car. He then drove away again,” Henderson said. “We’re thankful he had the decency to bring the little one back.” Crystal Leary, the mother, said: “As mums, we get really busy and we think we’re just running in for a second. “This is just a perfect example of just letting our guards down and how terrible it could have ended. I am thankful that he is okay. It was so stupid and I’ll never do that again, but it’s that split second decision that can just change everything.” Police said the car was later recovered 12km from Beaverton, and the hunt for the suspect is still on. “This is a good learning lesson for all of us who have children. Be extra careful with your kids. Take the extra step to make sure they’re safe,” said Henderson.
