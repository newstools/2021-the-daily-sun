CAPE Town City midfielder Mduduzi Mdantsane has given credit to his coach Jan Olde Riekerink and teammates for his outstanding performances this season. The 26-year-old former Baroka FC captain is enjoying his football and there has been a huge improvement in his game, compared to when he arrived at the club. Mdantsane joined The Citizens in December 2019 after leading Baroka to the Telkom Knockout title where they defeated Orlando Pirates in the final. His first season in Cape Town was not his best one. However, the Mpumalanga-born player has managed to turn things around. This season he has scored eight goals in the DStv Premiership for his side in 13 matches. “The coach has given me lots of freedom and I’m enjoying myself,” Mdantsane said. “I’m playing with top players and they’re always encouraging me and making things easier for me.” Without putting pressure on himself by setting a target of goals, Mdantsane said it will be crucial for him to convert the chances he gets. He said: “It’s important to convert the chances we get to win our league games. I have been lucky to be in the box all the time to get the opportunities and yeah, I have to bury those chances.” Mdantsane is four goals behind the current Premiership top goal-scorer Bradley Grobler, who has netted 12 times this season. Mdantsane’s side are fourth on the log with 22 points after 13 matches. They will be back in the league action on Sunday where they will face Baroka at Peter Mokaba Stadium at 3pm. Meanwhile, Cape Town City have confirmed that striker Prince Opoku Agyemang has returned to Ghana to rejoin Medeama SC. Agyemang joined City in June last year on a one-year loan deal with an option to sign him on a permanent deal until 2024. However, the 28-year-old failed to make an impact in South African football and his stay in Cape Town has been cut to only six months.
