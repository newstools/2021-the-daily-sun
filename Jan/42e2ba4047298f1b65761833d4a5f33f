VETERAN actor John Kani has seemingly taken a swipe at government for moving at a snail’s pace to secure a vaccine that could save millions of lives. Russia and China are moving fast to secure a coronavirus vaccine. Government had previously told South Africans it was at an advanced stage to ensure a vaccine was secured. However, according to reports, government hasn’t paid the millions required to secure it. John Kani took issue with this. “If Russia has a vaccine, China has a vaccine, Brazil is about to use the Russia Sputnik V vaccine, and we don’t have a vaccine yet, then what the hell are we doing in Brics?” he tweeted. He was referring to the five emerging national economies grouping, of which Mzansi is a member. If Russia has a vaccine, China has a vaccine, India almost has a vaccine, Brazil is about to use the Russia Sputnik V vaccine and we don’t have a vaccine yet then what the hell are we doing in BRICS???
