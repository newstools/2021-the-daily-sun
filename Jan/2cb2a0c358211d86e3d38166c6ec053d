SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo does not believe their crunch DStv Premiership Tshwane derby against Mamelodi Sundowns will have an effect on their  chances of winning the DStv Premiership title. The Tshwane giants will lock horns in a top of the table clash at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (3:30pm). Matsatsantsa A Pitori are heading to this match trailing leaders Downs by two points on the Premiership standings with 22 points from 10 matches. A win over The Brazilians will see them occupy the top spot for the first time this season while their city rivals could drop to third spot depending on the outcome of third placed Swallows FC against Baroka at Peter Mokaba Stadium on the same day at 5pm. Tembo admitted that Sundowns have quality but they are focusing on themselves. He said: "I think on paper Sundowns have the quality and power to win the league. But with us, we have only played 10 games and there’s still a lot of football to be played, about 20 games. There would be a lot of twists and turns, and players are quite aware that irrespective of what happens against Sundowns I do not think that game will make us win or lose the league.” “We have to focus on one game at a time, that is what put us where we are at the moment. We have to stay focused, stay grounded,” he continued. “And for us the most important game is against Sundowns, once that game is gone we will have to focus on the next one, that is our approach. Tembo says he is aware of the work that has been done by the Sundowns three coaches, Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena, and Steve Komphela. “I know those three guys (Mngqithi, Mokwena and Komphela) personally, very good coaches and I think they have shown their quality. It is not going to be easy for us. But we will have to do what we have been doing all along and believe in what we have. Try to build what we have been building because we can only focus on ourselves that would be key for us.”
