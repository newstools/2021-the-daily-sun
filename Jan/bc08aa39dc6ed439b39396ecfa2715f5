TRAVELLING on the continent can be as perilous as attending a social gathering during the Covid-19 lockdown. Visiting teams often lose matches before they even step on the pitch, such is the myriad of challenges they face on their African safaris. But Kaizer Chiefs are going out of their way to make life easy for their team in their quest for glory in the Caf Champions League. And Khama Billiat has thanked club boss Kaizer Motaung for making their excursion to Angola this week a little bit comfortable. “Coming down here (Luanda) with a charter (flight), we appreciate it,” said Billiat. “The whole effort the chairman is putting in the team is really important for us to do well, to test ourselves against the rest of the Champions League giants.“ Amakhosi reached the Champions League group stages for the first time after they defeated Primeiro De Agosto 1-0 on aggregate on Tuesday. “It’s a great feeling. We want to thank God for reaching the group stages. Credit goes to the technical team and the entire team,” Billiat continued. “We want to be the generation that not only qualifies for the group stages but that goes all the way. This club has a very good history. We want to make our chairman proud.”
