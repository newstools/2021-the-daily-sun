BMW workers have been on strike against their incentives being taken away and unfair treatment. The workers started striking at the company’s offices in Rosslyn, Tshwane, on Friday 15 January and continued on Tuesday, 19 January. Workers didn’t want to be named and referred the SunTeam to Numsa officials. But they said they would not return to work until their incentives were paid and a manager who allegedly swore at a worker on Friday was dismissed.  “The management of BMW cancelled our incentives without our knowledge,” a worker said. Another worker said on Thursday, 14 January the company announced their incentives were being cut by 25%. He said they usually received 50% of their bonus in December and the rest in January. “We were paid the normal amount in December but this month, we only got 25%. “The company never informed us they were planning to cut our incentive money,” he said. “They’re doing business unfairly. It’s illegal because the company is not following our agreement. We’re not going back to work until the matter is resolved.”  The workers said they wanted the human resources general manager dismissed. “We want him gone because he threatens workers and he swore at one of us on Friday,” said a worker. Workers said their management said they’d only talk to Numsa if they went back to work. “We don’t want a closed door meeting because it will not benefit us. We want an open discussion,” said anther worker. Workers said they also wanted benefits, transport allowances and salary increases. They said they had been working hard and the company was reaching its targets. Numsa national spokeswoman Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said: “We are unable to comment at this time.” When the SunTeam contacted BMW industry relations manager Peter Dantjie for comment, he put down the phone. He didn’t answer any other calls.
