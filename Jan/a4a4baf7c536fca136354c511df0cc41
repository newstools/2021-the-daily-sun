MZANSI border gates are closed. But that’s not stopping illegal immigrants from slipping into the country unnotice. And proof was there on Thursday, 21 January after Gauteng cops bust illegal immigrants who allegedly paid R100 to enter Mzansi. Cops stopped a Toyota Zola Budd taxi ferrying 34 illegal immigrants from Mozambique on the N12 near Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni. But it remains a mystery how the illegal immigrants got into the country without being detected at the border.  Gauteng police spokesman, Captain Kay Makhubele, said the illegal immigrants told them they paid R100, but it was unclear what it was for. “But we can’t rule out that they may have paid that at the boarder to enter the country,” he said. Makhubele said they’d get more information as the matter is now under investigation. This will also help them find out how the suspects passed through the boarder. Makhubele said they also bust six people at the same road block for possession of drugs. “Seven cars were also impounded after it was found they were tempered with,” said Makhubele. They also went to a scrap yard in Tembisa in Ekurhuleni, where they arrested the owner after they found four engines, which were positively linked to stolen vehicles.
