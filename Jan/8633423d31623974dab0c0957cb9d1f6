A new reality show, Real Housewives of Durban, is about to hit the small screen. The series has had two successful seasons. Ayanda Ncwane, Nonkanyiso Conco, Kgomotso Ndungane, Sorisha Naaido, Nonku Williams and Anne-Tonni Lodick will be sharing their lives with Mzansi. Kgomotso, wife of former Sharks and Springbok winger Odwa Ndungane, runs a three-tier events company: a flower boutique, events equipment hiring and events creation. Entertainment mogul Ayanda, widow of late gospel singer Sfiso Ncwane, is also on the cast. Nonku, a mother of three, is founder of Ashes to Beauty Winery. Nonku is into construction, but she hardly talks about this venture on her social media platforms.
