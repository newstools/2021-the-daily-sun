The Department of Basic Education must prioritise the safety of matric exam markers. It’s crucial for everyone involved to follow Covid-19 precautionary measures. I hope the markers won’t withdraw out of fear, which is understandable. The challenge is that they would also socialise and interact with family members after leaving the marking centres. People who’ve marked will tell you that these centres are very densely populated. Government needs to be extra careful and look after the markers. Markers must also wear masks and sanitise. This second wave is killing people almost every day. The pandemic and risk-adjusted strategy would impact on the availability of markers across all provinces, given the risks associated with gatherings and the large number of teachers over the age of 60 or those with comorbidities.
