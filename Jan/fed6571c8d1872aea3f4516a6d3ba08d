WHEN gogo went to church on Sunday, all she wanted was to pray and discuss church matters. But she ended up catching bullets instead of the word of God. Bullets flew while cops dispersed a crowd at a church in Sebokeng zone 7 in the Vaal, south of Joburg. Cops said congregants contravened level 3 regulations, which prohibit church services. Gogo Mary Tsotetsi told Daily Sun the church had planned to discuss the impact lockdown had on churches. They also planned to have a short prayer session. But she was hurt when police dispersed them. The 62-year-old from Evaton said: “Everyone was wearing a mask in the church and practised social distancing.  “I was late and a few minutes after I arrived police invaded the church and started dragging people out without warning.” Gogo Mary felt something hitting her forehead and she started bleeding. “I was confused about what was happening and shocked by the police’s behaviour,” she said. “Mamfundisi and another congregant accompanied me to the clinic and the Evaton Police Station. “Instead of helping me open a case, cops arrested me for contravening the Disaster Management Act.” Gogo was released on bail later in the day and will appear in court on 10 March. “I’m really disappointed with the law,” she said. Mamfundisi Puseletso Mofokeng said her husband was in police custody. She said they had a permit to meet and adhered to safety measures. “Everyone was screened. We all had masks on and social distancing was adhered to,” said Puseletso. Apostle John Radebe of the Sebokeng Pastoral Forum, who was part of the meeting, said they wanted to discuss the unfairness of lockdown and its impact on churches. “We disagree with churches being shut down,” he said. “This has brought difficulty to many livelihoods, mostly those who’re helped by the church for food and shelter. “Pastors and church members live in fear of intimidation by cops. Churches are broken into and equipment stolen.”
