THE Restaurant Association of South Africa staged a sit-in at the Union Buildings in Tshwane yesterday over the alcohol ban. Wendy Alberts, chief executive officer of the association, said they were notified that it would take from seven to 14 days for the matter to be dealt with. So they planned the week-long sit-in to be granted an opportunity to hold an inter-ministerial meeting with the president. “The restaurant industry is at a critical stage and simply could not continue as it had since the country was moved back to the adjusted level 3 of the national lockdown,” she said. “We need to balance lives and livelihoods by looking at responsible ways to reopen the industry where we can also play our part. “By not doing so, we’re forcing the trade to go underground and back to house parties in uncontrolled spaces.” Alberts said they advocate responsibility. “As it is, we are able to observe contact tracing and social distancing along with other regulations and protocols,” she said. Other protesters said many restaurants were closing because of the alcohol ban, and that was bad for their families as well as businesses. “We understand how the virus is spreading, but we are losing jobs,” they said. A representative from the office of the president Shonisani Mudau accepted the memorandum of behalf of government. He said that he’d forward it to all the relevant people.
