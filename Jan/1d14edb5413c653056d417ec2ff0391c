The Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg has ordered former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng to repay over R850 000 of the public broadcaster's money that he used for his personal legal fees during his time there. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) and the SABC took Motsoeneng to court to recoup the money he used to pay for his legal fees in two cases which were challenged in court: his appointment as COO of the SABC, and his appointment as Group Executive of Corporate Affairs. In both cases he was represented by Majavu Incorporated who were listed as the second defendant in the case. The third defendant was Malesane Raphela who is a former General Manager of Financial and Management reporting. She is accused of having authorised the payments of Motsoeneng's legal fees while being aware that they were a personal cost, and not the SABC's. In a judgment handed down last week Friday Judge Thina Siwendu ordered Motsoeneng to pay back R851 981.73 with interest. Motsoeneng was also ordered to pay the costs of the interlocutory applications and the cost of the judgment. The head of the SIU Advocate Andy Mothibi welcomed the judgment. "This is a continuation of implementation of the SIU investigations outcomes and consequence management to recover monies lost by the SABC. There are other cases enrolled in the High Court and in the Special Tribunal awaiting adjudication and will result in further recoveries for the SABC," said Mothibi. https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/hlaudi-motsoeneng-ordered-to-pay-back-more-than-r850k-of-sabc-money-used-for-personal-legal-fees-20210129
