TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) received a major boost ahead of their crucial DStv Premiership clash against Orlando Pirates at Thohoyandou Stadium today (5pm). Vhadau VhaDamani coach Joel Masutha is set to welcome back his trusted defender Ndivhuwo Ravhuhali, who has not played for the Venda-based side this year due to health problems. The 28-year-old defender missed Tshakhuma’s two games this year in which they conceded four goals in his absence TTM suffered a 2-0 defeat to Stellenbosch FC and drew 2-2 with Cape Town City. The last time Ravhuhali played for Tshakhuma was in their 1-1 draw against their Venda rivals Black Leopards last December. “It’s good to have Ravhuhali back after his health problem, as he has been doing well,” said Masutha. “We are facing a big team and we need all our players available. I spoke to him and he’s fine and ready to play.” The other players that Masutha will be counting on against Pirates are former Buccaneers – Alfred Ndengane, Meshack Maphangule and Thabo Rakhale – to upset the Soweto giants. TTM come into this clash without a win in five consecutive league matches. They have drawn four and lost one. The last time they won a league game was when they beat Baroka 1-0 in November. “We are not going to be undermined by Pirates, this is despite being a big team,” said Masutha.
