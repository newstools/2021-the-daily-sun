A MAN who has been on the run since last year handed himself to the police this week. The 34-year-old had allegedly stabbed his lover (34) and stepdaughter (14) with a bottle in November last year at Dingledale Trust in Chochocho Village, near Acornhoek, Mpumalanga. He appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge on Thursday 21 January. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told Daily Sun the suspect (34) reportedly arrived at the victim’s house at night and smashed the windows, where he gained entry. He said he started to attack his lover with a bottle by stabbing her in the upper body several times, and when the daughter tried to come to the mother’s rescue she was stabbed in the hands. “The suspect fled the scene and police were alerted about the incident. The injured victims were rushed to a nearby local clinic for medical attention,” said Hlathi. “A manhunt was launched but the suspect later volunteered to hand himself over to police at Mhala where he was charged with two counts of attempted murder. “We want to urge victims of abuse to get help and report such incidents to the police, rather than to wait for their partner to kill them,’ he said. The suspect is expected to appear in court again on 5 February and will remain in police custody.
