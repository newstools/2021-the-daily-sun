FIRE victims say officials have told them they’ll no longer be assisted with building materials. Luzuko Mda (43) from Taiwan in Khayelitsha told Daily Sun he didn’t understand why the City of Cape Town decided not to help. “Where are we supposed to get money to buy building materials when most of us lost our jobs because of Covid-19,” said Mda. “Why can’t the city continue helping us until things return to normal?” Another resident said if the municipality didn’t want to help, many people would end up homeless. “We had a very bad year and the city is making the new one difficult,” said the resident. A number of shacks and houses burned down in a fire on New Year’s Day. The resident said: “The most painful thing about this is that everyone knows us when they want our votes, but when it’s time to help they have excuses.” City of Cape Town MMC for human settlements, Malusi Booi, said the municipality was not able to offer help outside of providing fire kits in areas where a disaster hadn’t been declared. “The city will assist in guiding and rebuilding affected areas, and will help with certificates. This will start once the site has been cleared,” he said. Booi said Gift of the Givers was helping feed the affected residents, who were being accommodated in a nearby church. “Sassa has been advised of the incident and has been requested to provide social relief assistance,” he said.
