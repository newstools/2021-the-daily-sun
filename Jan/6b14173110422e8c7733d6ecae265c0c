RESIDENTS are gatvol of thieves who steal and vandalise the fence at their local cemetery. Residents of Khayelitsha in Cape Town now fear that graves of their loved ones will be next. Lilitha Tukane (33) told Daily Sun: “I now have to visit my mother’s grave every month just to check that it’s not vandalised because, without a fence, anyone can get in and damage tombstones. “I don’t understand why someone would strip graveyard fencing. “Of all the places they could steal from, why steal a fence that protects the dead. This is disrespect on another level.” Residents told Daily Sun the fence had been stolen more than once. Nyameko Masimbuka (54) said: “They keep coming back even after the fence has been replaced. “Only cowards do that. The dead can’t stand up for themselves.” Community services MMC, Zahid Badroodien, said: “The city is aware of sections of the metal palisade fence being stolen over time. Various attempts have been made to secure and repair the fence. “On occasion, staff and security have reported perpetrators to the police and they were arrested.” He said the city’s parks department replaced the steel palisade with concrete, but the problem continued. Badroodien urged residents to report vandalism by phoning the number 021 480 7700 from a cellphone, or calling 107 from a landline. Sangoma Ncedo Ntanjana (45) from Mbekweni said people who disrespect the dead in this manner were inviting bad luck. Said the sangoma: “They carry very evil spirits from the graveyard back to their homes. “They must take the fence back and get strong muthi from a sangoma to wash these spirits away.”
