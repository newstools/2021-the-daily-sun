Two people were seriously injured after a taxi carrying 15 passengers overturned on the M5 on Kromboom way on Friday morning, 29 January. According to the Western Cape Government Health EMS team, they received a call about the accident at 6.23am. “The vehicle was transporting 15 passengers – 10 females and five males. Two patients are seriously injured, and a male patient has been intubated and transported to the hospital. Thirteen patients sustained minor injuries and were triaged. The scene has been cleared. All patients have been transported to the hospital,” said EMS spokeswoman Deanna Bessick. One EMS rescue vehicle was at the scene, as well as three ambulances, a response vehicle and four private ambulances. The City of Cape Town Traffic Department’s spokesman Richard Coleman confirmed the crash. “We had an accident on the M5 that is northbound just after Racecourse Road where a taxi has overturned. At that scene, we have 15 serious injuries and we have the central lane and right late that is obstructed,” he said. Langa resident Bulelwa Maki told the SunTeam the taxi was coming from Langa on its way to Claremont. “My cousin was in that taxi but I spoke to her, she is doing fine. She called me saying they had an accident. “I was shocked and devastated but I felt better when she said she is not badly injured. Only her neck and left leg have been injured. I’m glad no one died,” said Bulelwa. This crash follows another accident earlier this week which saw a truck carrying farm workers overturning in the Klapmuts area just outside Cape Town.
