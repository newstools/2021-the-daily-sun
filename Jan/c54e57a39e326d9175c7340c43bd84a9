TS Galaxy striker Mxolisi Macuphu is hoping to hit the ground running in 2021 when his side face Baroka FC in the DStv Premiership on Tuesday. The former SuperSport United and BidVest Wits forward finally ended his goal-drought at the start of the season with a brace against Cape Town City, albeit in a losing cause as they went down 3-2 in the Mother City. That promoted the exit of coach Dan Malesela, who has since been replaced by his assistant Zipho Dlangalala. “If feels great to be back at training after the Christmas break. The first day is always the toughest,” Macuphu told his club’s website. “The nicest part is that we started on a good note. We look forward to finish the first round of the season as we’ve only played eight games and left with seven games. We want to start on a good note in the month of January.” Macuphu feels he should have scored more this season, but hopes the floodgates have opened with his brace against City. “The two goals have been coming. As a striker that hoe you get judged personally. I feel, I’ve had some quality games but the goals were the only problem. “To finish off with a brace, it feels great and wonderful. I look forward to continue where I left off.” Galaxy have a single win from their eight games so far, and have lost their last three. -SuperSport
