FAMILY and friends celebrated Wakhe’s life yesterday. A memorial service was held for amapiano singer Sello “Wakhe” Motsepe (48) at Rama City in Tshwane following his death in Mmakau, North West, on Sunday. According to his family, Wakhe died from HIV and circumcision complications. He released an EP in November called Mpho Nthite, along with madala David “Poponki” Moeketsi (60). Wakhe’s aunt, Maria, (61) said the family was still trying to come to terms with his death.  “He was a great man who was full of love and jokes. His space will never be filled,” she said. Poponki said: “When I heard the sad news that Wakhe is dead, I slept the whole day and night.” He said Wakhe was like a brother to him and no one could replace him. Musician McKenzie Matome was saddened by the news. “The last time we were together was at Rama City for their EP launch,” he said. “He was fine and happy. He was a cool guy and I expected a lot from him.” National Council of Provinces member, Kenny Motsamai, said it was painful to lose Wakhe. “He was promoting Rama City and bringing unity in the community through music.” Mpho Nthite, after whom they named the song, was expecting much more from him. “Let’s continue with where Wakhe left off and move forward,” he said. “His legacy will not die. We’ll showcase his pictures at the photo museum we have at Rama City.” The song was dedicated to Mpho, who helped Poponki and Wakhe get RDPs in 2019. Wakhe’s family said he’d been in and out of hospital since undergoing a circumcision procedure last year. He’ll be buried on Saturday, 9 January at Tshwara Cemetery in Mmakau at 8am.
