MANY people in Mzansi are unhappy with the ban on going to dams and rivers, but for fishermen it’s a matter of life and death. “This ban must be lifted or else we will starve,” said Michael Matshaba (43) from Seshego outside Polokwane in Limpopo. “This is the only way I know how to survive. It’s difficult to catch fish while you continuously looking over your shoulder for the police or soldiers.” Fishermen said they couldn’t stay away from dams and abide by the ban as they fish for survival. They have no choice but to visit nearby dams in Seshego. “I tried to stay at home but I can’t take it anymore,” said a 28-year-old fisherman. “Now that the R350 Covid-19 unemployment relief grant is coming to an end, we’re going to struggle even more,” he said. As law enforcement continue with their patrols, the men have come up with ways to avoid being arrested. Manuel Sihlangu (36) said they now come to the dam using a time table and on different days. “If we stay at home we will die of hunger, so we rather risk getting arrested,” Manuel. They said they sell the fish to residents from R20 up to R40, depending on the size of the fish.
