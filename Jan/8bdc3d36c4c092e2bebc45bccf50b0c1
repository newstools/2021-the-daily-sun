THE Presidency is set to take an internal disciplinary action against President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Khusela Diko to determine if a full scale disciplinary action should be taken against her. Diko has been on special since July last year  after it emerged that the company of her husband, Royal Baca, was irregularly awarded a multi million personal protective equipment tender by the Gauteng health department. The awarding of the tender led to then health MEC Bandile Masuku being removed from office and other senior officials in the department also being axed. The Presidency in a statement on Sunday said even the investigation of the Special Investigative Unit could not find evidence that directly linked Diko to the awarding of the tender, it has established that she had not disclosed all her financial interests. “On the basis of a referral from the SIU on her failure to disclose her financial interests, the Presidency has decided to initiate an internal disciplinary process against Ms Diko. “The relevant processes prescribed in the Public Service Regulations and related documents will be triggered and handled by the Acting Director-General of the Presidency, including consideration of whether Ms Diko remains on special leave or is formally suspended pending the disciplinary process,” The Presidency said. The Presidency said the SIU had informed it that the corruption component in the awarding of two tenders to Royal Bhaca was ongoing. However so far it had not obtained evidence pointing to Diko’s involvement in the awarding of two tenders to her husband’s company or in respect of the irregularities identified to the awarding. It said Tyrone Seale will continue serving as acting spokesman until further notice.
