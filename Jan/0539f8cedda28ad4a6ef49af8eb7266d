THESE residents say a massive sinkhole, which swallowed a car in 2019, is giving them a bigger headache than Covid-19. The people of Jeffesville in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, told Daily Sun they lived in fear of the hole, which grew bigger by the day. Abraham Phaago (37) said he slept with one eye open and often had nightmares about the sinkhole, which was right next to their shacks. “We are sleeping on top of a time bomb that is about to explode. Sometimes, I think of abandoning my place but I have nowhere else to go.” Abraham told the SunTeam residents had started filling the sinkhole with rubbish, which was causing a health hazard. He said they were pleading with the municipality to do something about it. Susan Dlamini (55) said she feared for her children as they played outside.  “This is something I have seen before. A car could be swallowed by that hole.” Other residents said the sinkhole was a death trap and they wanted to be moved as they didn’t feel safe living close to it. City of Tshwane’s acting chief of staff Jordan Griffiths said the sinkhole had been mapped and recorded by the municipality. “It forms part of a comprehensive sinkhole rehabilitation plan that has been adopted by the city. The city funds the refurbishment of sinkholes based on the severity and impact and this determines their prioritisation,” said Griffiths. He said dealing with sinkholes was expensive as it required specific planning and materials to ensure a long-lasting solution.
