A MAN is on the run after allegedly killing his friend and keeping the body in his house until it started decomposing. The man allegedly murdered his friend on Wednesday, 20 January but the body was only discovered on Sunday, 24 January at a house in zone 2 of Langa, Cape Town. The suspect’s girlfriend informed the Langa Safety Patrol about the incident. The team’s Vuyani Tshamulambo told Daily Sun the woman told them the victim Luyanda Pentle (34) was killed by her boyfriend. “I think the boyfriend tried to stop her from reporting it, but she couldn’t stand the smell. When we arrived at the house, it was like a rotting rat was somewhere in the yard. The body was already turning green when we found it.” A tenant in the backyard of the house said she heard screaming on Wednesday and saw the suspect cleaning the house the next day. Luyanda’s mum, Ntombizodwa Makeleni, (52) said she was devastated by the death of her son. “I heard the news when I was at work, but I thought it wasn’t true. My family asked me to come back home and when I arrived, people were crying,” said Ntombizodwa. She said she’d forgiven the killer but she wanted him to rot in jail. “The law must take its course. If he is let off, he will do this to someone else,” she said. When the SunTeam visited the house, the suspect’s family was cleaning. Members of his family said he must be arrested because he had harmed their name. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A murder case is being investigated. The circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation and detectives are tracking the suspect. No arrests have been made yet.”
