FRIENDS of Sibonokuhle Ndesana (19) marched to the house where she was murdered on Sunday evening. Sibonokuhle was allegedly killed by her boyfriend in Philippi Browns Farm in Cape Town. Lunathi Matiwane (21) said Sibonokuhle was her best friend. She said they didn’t understand why police let the suspect go. “Our justice system continues to fail us. How could they let him go? He said he made a mistake. What more evidence do they want?” asked Matiwane. Sibonokuhle’s body was found inside her boyfriend’s shack. When the friends went to the house they found residents waiting for them. A resident said they saw on Facebook protesters saying they’ll burn the man’s house. “We understand what they are doing because women are being killed every day, but we’ll not allow them to burn his shack,” said the resident. He said they were labelled as condoning what the suspect did.  “We live in a squatter camp. What the suspect did was wrong, but burning his shack will affect us and we had nothing to do with what he did. “He must pay for his sins, but we can’t be punished,” said the resident. Sinazo Ntozonke (25) said they would continue fighting for justice for Sibonokuhle. According to police spokesman, Colonel Andre Traut, the boyfriend was released because there wasn’t enough evidence to keep him. “He was not brought before the court. Once more evidence has been gathered an arrest could be made,” he said.
