FOR the first time in history, the commemoration of the Battle of Isandlwana was done virtually on Saturday, 23 January. The battle, which happened near Isandlwana Mountain in northern KZN in 1879, saw Zulu warriors defeating the British army with just spears and shields. In past years, the royal family, government officials, residents and tourists flocked to the mountain to commemorate the event. This was the first time the country didn’t see a re-enactment of the battle. During his virtual address, King Goodwill Zwelithini said it was important for leaders and residents to work together to defeat Covid-19. “It looks like something is not being done correctly in terms of communication between government and the people. “The information expected to save the country is not being transmitted correctly. “If we were to be truthful, we would acknowledge that it was government’s failure to take drastic action at the right time, and unwillingness of the people to listen attentively, that led to the increase in infections and deaths.” The king said it was known that the Zulu nation was forced to face the British despite disagreements within the community. “Our forefathers knew how important it was to protect what was rightfully theirs. The nation agreed that the disagreements would be dealt with later. What needed to be done first was to conquer the enemy.” He said if people could have the same mentality, Covid-19 would be defeated.
