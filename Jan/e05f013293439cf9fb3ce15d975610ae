THANKS to crowd funding, Thokozani Sibeko has been able to take his business to a new level. The 21-year-old poultry farmer from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, used to travel on his bicycle to sell eggs but thanks to Good Samaritans, he was able to buy a scooter. In June last year, Daily Sun published a a story about how a scooter would make a huge difference in his life. He then decided to use the publicity to ask for help on social media. “Making deliveries using a bicycle was becoming inconvenient as I kept getting orders from outside my area.” Thokozani said it wasn’t easy to start his crowd funding campaign on social media.  “People were giving me negative responses and saying entrepreneurs don’t beg. They said I should work hard and buy what I need for myself. “I did manage to raise funds. It wasn’t enough for a Tuk Tuk but I was able to buy a scooter,” he said. Tokozani said he was surprised to see how supportive his clients were. “A lot of money came from them. Eggs are now delivered to people’s doorsteps in a short space of time. “The scooter has brought a lot of growth to my business,” he said. Thokozani said it was discouraging that the government was not doing much to financially support small businesses in the kasis. “They are not taking responsibility for uplifting and developing youth entrepreneurship. Even if your application for funding is approved, it takes a long time to get the money. I strongly recommend crowd funding as it worked for me,” he said. Thokozani said he’d use his business to help his community. He said he was also in his second year of BCom accounting studies at the University of Joburg. “Alleviating the high level of unemployment is my main goal for my community. By March, I plan to have 10 branded gazebos I’ll place outside malls. I want young people to buy in bulk from me at a discount and then sell for themselves from the gazebos.”
