Baroka FC will square off with Cape Town City in a DStv Premiership match at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 3:30 pm CAT. Bakgaga Ba Mphahlele are coming off a morale-boosting 1-1 draw against Kaizer Chiefs on Tuesday, but they are now winless in their last two league matches. Therefore, Baroka are sitting on position eight on the league standings - three points behind sixth-placed Lamontville Golden Arrows, who have two games in hand. Thoka Matsimela, the Baroka head coach, was pleased with his charges' performance in their draw against the mighty Amakhosi. "So now we are focusing on the next game. But the overall performance of my boys, I'm very impressed," Matsimela said. "The way we were controlling the game it looked as if we could steal three points. Unfortunately an own goal, but I can't cry. It was just unlucky for us and we move on." Meanwhile, City are in cloud nine at the moment having registered their second consecutive win when they defeated Arrows 4-2 at home last weekend. The Citizens now find themselves fourth on the league standings - five points behind joint second-placed SuperSport United and Swallows FC. Mduduzi Mdantsane, the City attacking midfielder, revealed the secret to his current good scoring form after netting his eighth goal of the season against Arrows. "Arrows had not lost a game. It wasn't easy, we worked hard as a team. The coach [Jan Olde Riekerink] has given me lots of freedom. I am always in the box and I am enjoying myself," Mdantsane said. "I am playing with top players and they are always encouraging me and making things easier for me. We need goals to win the game and it is important to convert. When I get a chance I need to score." -SuperSport
