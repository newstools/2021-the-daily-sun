TSHEPISO Maekisa’s family wants her murderer behind bars. The 32-year-old from Alexandra, east of Joburg, was found dead in the veld in Heidelberg. Speaking on behalf of the family, Palesa Maekisa (31) told Daily Sun that on 10 January, Tshepiso left her home to meet her baby daddy in Vosloorus with their two-year-old child. Tshepiso’s friends and family then received WhatsApp messages from her between Monday, 11 January and Friday, 15 January, saying she was on holiday with a friend. “On 16 January, Tshepiso’s mum received a call from an unknown woman saying that she had found her wallet at a mall in Alexandra,” she said.
