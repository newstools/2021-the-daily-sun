THE increasing numbers of Covid-19 infections in Mzansi have forced Netball South Africa to postpone their events which were set to take place this month. NSA president, Cecilia Molokwane, and her executive committee have announced the suspension of all event with immediate effect until further notice. This will result in less action for the SA netball national team again, as it happened last year where they only played twice. The Spar Proteas played in January last year during the Vitality Netball Nations Cup, and in November where they played against Malawi Queens in a three-match series in Rustenburg. This month Spar Proteas were set to play in the Spar Challenge against Uganda. The series was set to take place in Cape Town between the 20 to 27 January. Molokwane said: “As the country continues to see Covid-19 numbers rising, it is very scary seeing what is going on around us. We see numbers rising and these numbers are names of people that we know. “As an executive, it was very important for us to decide to postpone all our planned activities until further notice. “We will continue to take lead from government and consult all relevant stakeholder as we take all the steps to ensure that we protect lives.” Other postponed netball activities include the SA Under 21 training camp, which was set to take place from 11-15 January and the Male National Championships. Molokwane concluded: “I think it is also important that we take this time and continue to use this moment to educate our people about the importance of adhering to health regulations and protocols around Covid-19. “Netball South Africa will continue to assess the situation and review the decision to either continue the events or keep them suspended until it is safe to resume playing.”
