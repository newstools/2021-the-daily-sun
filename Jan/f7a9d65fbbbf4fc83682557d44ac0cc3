American actress Alexandra Paul once said the cars we drive say a lot about us. The relationship between people and cars can be likened to a scene taken out of a rom-com series. This relationship goes beyond long drives such as sex. According to sexologists, humans would’ve at least have had sex once in a car in their lifetime. So, here are some cars built for the ultimate orgasm experience: 1. Mercedes-Maybach G 650 Landaulet  The combination of first class-spec rear seats which are heated, cooled, and have massaging thrones that recline almost flat. It also has a convertible top over the back to reveal the stars in all their glory that make this machine perfect for making love anywhere on the face of the Earth. 2. Bentley Mulsanne  With one of the nicest interiors in the automotive realm, a ride smoother than freshly-churned butter, and a massive back seat that offers a champagne cooler and a pair of crystal flutes to drink from, there’s no classier place to make babies at highway velocity than the rear of this massive luxury sedan. 3. Ferrari GTC4Lusso  Ferraris are naturally sexy, but their low rooflines and snug, race car-like interiors mean they’re not particularly good places to have sex.
