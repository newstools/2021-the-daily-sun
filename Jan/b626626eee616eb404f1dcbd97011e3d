THE case against a father bust for allegedly stabbing his son has been postponed to Monday, 25 January, for a lawyer to be arranged and a possible bail hearing. This came after the Acornhoek Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga had to be temporarily closed on Tuesday, 19 January due to an official testing positive for Covid-19. The 43-year-old father was arrested by police while residents were attacking him. He allegedly charged at his 19-year-old son with a spear and stabbed him in the leg before killing him in broad daylight in the street. The incident took place in Ga-Moreku, outside Acornhoek on Wednesday, 13 January at about 4pm.  The man then ran back to his village, allegedly carrying the bloody spear and shouting that he was a hero for killing his son. He apparently told residents to go and look at the body. He was caught by an angry group of people, but cops arrived before he was killed. The man’s 41-year-old wife said he had been picking fights with his son since 26 December. She said she received a call from her son saying his dad was attacking him. She said she told him to go to a friend’s house, but his dad allegedly followed him with a spear. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed the man was arrested for the murder of his son. “This incident is very disheartening. “It is unconscionable that a man could kill his own son,” he said.
