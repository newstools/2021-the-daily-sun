DAN “Dance” Maselela broke into one of his trademark touchline dances as Chippa United snatched a draw from the jaws of defeat last night. Facing yet another DStv Premiership defeat, the Chilli Boys scored a late equaliser through Maloisane Mokhele. The Port Elizabeth-based side were the first on the scoresheet, with Andile Mbenyane pouncing on a spilled ball to open the scoring in the first half. Bradley Grobler scored his eighth goal of the season as he drew United level with a looping header, and later saw Thamsanqa Gabuza put Matsatsantsa in the lead. But in his first match since he returned to Chippa for his fourth stint, Malesela cut a forlorn figure as raindrops pelted down his face at Lucas Moripe Stadium. He has been in the position before and on the summary of the game, he is in for a torrid time. SuperSport had no business dropping maximum points, especially at home. It baffles the mind how they missed a glut of chances in a match they could have at the canter. The match is without doubt the worst game they have played under Kaitano Tembo and it explains why they have often come shot in the league title race. But Malesela has more problems. Chippa are still stuck in the starting blocks, having already fired a coach in Lehlohonolo Seema. Their latest performance suggests Malesela has his work cut out for him… if he will have enough time in the hot seat to fix the team. They were fortunate to pick a point, Mokhele having finished off from a defensive error to cancel out Gabuza’s potential winner. Their goals came against the run of play as United messed up chance after chance to wrap up the game. Sipho Mbule will be more disappointed, having had one of his best games for United.
