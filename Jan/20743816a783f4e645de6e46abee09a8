STOP visiting the families of the Covid-19 deceased! These were the words of Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane when he recently expressed concern over the rapid rise in infections in rural parts of the province. “We know that we want to give comfort and support to families who have lost their loved ones, but not at this time,” he said. The premier said the practice of visiting families after a death was a huge problem. He said the province was at war with an invisible enemy – the virus. “By the way, you don’t have that time. So we are appealing to people to minimise the number of people they interact with,” he said. “We cannot have people sitting there for a week. Stop visiting the families of the deceased.” Mabuyane said the majority of infections happened during these visits. “People need to be extra careful and put in place prevention systems to make sure that they don’t become victims of this virus. We saw funerals being super spreader events. ‘We are doing everything we can to contain the spread of the virus,” said the premier. “We are appealing to our families. We know it’s not easy and that we do things that way – showing support to families. “This invisible enemy moves with the movement of people. “The more people move around, the more the virus moves around.” Mabuyane said the provincial government was trying to regulate funerals as much as possible. “How many days and hours must be used to bury someone?”
