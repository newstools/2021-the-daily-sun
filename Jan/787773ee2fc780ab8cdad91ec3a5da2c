THUGS wanted the pin to her brother-in-law’s bank card, but when she couldn’t give it to them they shot her in the arm! The traumatised woman, who can’t be named for legal reasons, told Daily Sun the thugs told her she was stubborn, dragged her into the bushes, and raped her. She said the nightmare started when she stopped her car for her brother-in-law to pee. The thugs gang-raped her on Monday before speeding off in her grey VW Passat. “They slapped me in the face and told me to undress,” she said. Captain Johannes Ramphora said the woman and her brother-in-law were travelling on the N12. “They stopped just after the Etwatwa off-ramp,” he said. “They were travelling from Boksburg in Ekurhuleni, in the Mpumalanga direction.” Ramphora said after the suspects left, the woman managed to walk and find help. Three men took her to Daveyton cop shop. Her brother-in-law was nowhere to be found. On the same night, police went to the crime scene but couldn’t find him. The following morning they went back and found his body. “He’d been shot twice in the upper body,” said Ramphora. Cases of murder, attempted murder, rape and hijacking were opened. Ramphora said a laptop and two Huawei cellphones worth R1 800 were taken.
