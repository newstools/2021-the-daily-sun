PITSO Mosimane says local coaches should not be
“Amabinneplaas” but take up positions on the continent. Mosimane reached new frontiers taking over as head coach
of Al Ahly five months ago. He has already achieved considerable success and is now
taking the team to the 2021 Fifa Club World Cup in Qatar. “I’m patriotic and I carry the SA national flag with me.
You can always see it in my pictures because I know where I come from. I come
from humble beginnings,” Mosimane told Safja. “I come from the township and I want to say to the
township boy that it is possible. That is what Trevor Noah… what Black
Coffee and a lot of guys are doing. I’m not being a racist, but this is black excellence. You
can come from humble beginnings and make it anywhere. “We’ve got a term ‘binneplaas’. We can't be
comfortable but have to look beyond the borders.” Admittedly, adapting to a new environment has been a
challenge for Mosimane. “It is different. You know the lifestyle is not the same.
The country is different… the food. There’s no social life,” he explained. “But you sacrifice for the best. It’s tough here. Even
though I signed a two-year contract, it can be six months. I’m fully aware of
that. But I say to the next person it is possible. Nelson
Mandela said it always seems impossible until it is done. “We must never forget our flag and make sure we are ambassadors
of our country.”
