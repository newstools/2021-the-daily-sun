A FAMILY is homeless after a violent storm hit their nine-roomed house in Agincourt near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Saturday. Saddened Cynthia Chiloane (45) told the SunTeam she was sitting under a giant marula tree in the afternoon when she saw a dark cloud floating towards her village. “Suddenly I saw a dark cloud floating towards our direction. It quickly covered the village as a violent storm hit. I prayed to God to save my family and my newly built nine-roomed house. “Unfortunately when I finished the prayer and ran inside, I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the roof fly off as the rain poured down. The rain wet almost everything including valuable documents, food, furniture and clothes,” said Cynthia. Her stepson Bunting Brendon (27) said he had gone out to receive the R350 unemployment grant at Ximhungwe Post Office when he received a call. “I was in the queue to get the R350 at the post office when I received a call from my stepmum Cynthia that our house roof had been blown off. “But we are thankful to the villagers who assisted us with sorting out the damages. We have nothing and we wish for Good Samaritans to help us,” said Brendon. Bushbuckridge municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said: “We are sending our disaster management team for assessment and for assistance where necessary.”
