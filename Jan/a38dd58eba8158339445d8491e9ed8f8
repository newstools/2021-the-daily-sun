ANY school in Gauteng that is in operation is defying the state! These were the words of Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi during his visit to Helpmekaar Kollege in Braamfontein, Joburg, after reports the school intended to open. Last week, Deputy Basic Education Minister Reginah Mhaule announced that both public and private schools would open on 15 February. Lesufi said: “Over the weekend, I was flooded with reports there are schools that believe they should go ahead and reopen. “We sensed danger and felt we can’t just persuade the public education system. “We also need to persuade the private education system. They’re in the same community. “It’s not about the institution’s capability to manage the virus. It’s about movement. The virus is spread through the movement of people.” He said some schools reportedly intended to continue operating. “Among them is the institution of schools called Curro,” he said. “We were in discussion with the group and group CEO and, after our discussion, we agreed they also have to reconsider their decision,” he said. “They’ve also agreed to retract face-to-face learning. The province is under siege from Covid-19 and we need everyone to play their part.” The Provincial Coronavirus Command Council, which provided them with reports and guidance on how to manage the virus, had raised concern in three areas. “The first was people coming back to Gauteng, and that the numbers were huge. Our hospitals are starting to pile up. “Secondly, when the borders were opened we had a huge influx of people coming to the province. “The numbers are increasing. Thirdly, a lot of factories were reopening as we’re the economic hub of the country.”
