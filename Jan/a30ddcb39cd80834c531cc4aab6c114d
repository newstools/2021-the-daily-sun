MOLAHLELI Koali (60) desperately needs building material to extend his shack so his daughter can have room to take a bath. The madala lives in the one-bedroom shack in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, with his two kids – an 18-year-old daughter and a 25-year-old son. “When my daughter needs to take a bath, we have to go outside because there’s no space or privacy,” Molahleli told Daily Sun. “I want to extend my shack so that I can stay in the other room when she’s taking a bath.” He painfully said that some people even called his shack a toilet. “To them it might look like a toilet, but to me it’s a home. The grant money I receive is only enough to buy food. I can’t afford building material.” Molahleli’s other challenge is that his son has to go to initiation school. “He’s old enough to go, but we don’t have money. I pray that he doesn’t get involved in crime to raise the funds.” The madala sleeps on a single bed while the kids sleep on the floor. “When it rains, we all sleep on the bed because water leaks into the shack. “I heard that people get help after their stories are published in the People’s Paper, and I hope that it will also happen to us.” His daughter will be in grade 12 this year. She told Daily Sun that she works hard so she’ll be able to change her family’s situation. “Studying in this limited space is not easy. But I work hard so I can change my family’s situation.” “Living like this is not fun. We really need help,” she said.
