MARITZBURG United players continue to commit individual errors. It was a problem coach Ernst Middendorp thought he had solved. But the mistakes returned on Wednesday when the Team of Choice were thumped 3-0 by TS Galaxy in their DStv Premiership clash at the Harry Gwala Stadium. Now United are back in the relegation zone, lying 15th with nine points from 12 matches. Now Middendorp wants his side to bounce back when they host wounded Orlando Pirates at the same venue on Saturday(5pm). The German-born coach said the loss was not ideal preparation going into the clash against Bucs, who have their own problems. Pirates come into this fixture after they were held by Maritzburg’s provincial rivals Golden Arrows in a goalless draw on Wednesday, having lost 2-0 in their previous game to Black Leopards. “We have to ask ourselves if we want to get results. It is not only talent and skills that are needed. The mentality of the team must (also) be okay (as well),” said Middendorp. He added: “Now the game against Pirates is a crucial match (for us). “Of course, the pressure is on both sides but we have to look (at ourselves) to see who is fresh and is prepared to go into this game and do their best.” Summing up how bad it was for his team against Owen da Gama’s Galaxy, Middendorp said even if they could to play for three days they would not have scored. “They were very robust against us in one duels. We gave them opportunities and made simple mistakes,” he said. “We weren’t able to produce any scoring opportunities. We could have played for days and I don’t think we would have scored.”
