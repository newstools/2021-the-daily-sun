RETAINING their DStv Premiership status this season is still the priority for Swallows FC. That is despite the Birds brilliant start back to the top flight football after gaining promotion to the DStv Premiership last season. That is the goal of many clubs who won promotion. They are usually keen to consolidate. But that is not the case with the Dube Birds who are defying the odds. Without finance to compete in the market with the big guns, they are joint-top of the Premiership alongside defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns on 25 points from 11 games played. The Birds, Downs and Golden Arrows are the only unbeaten sides left in the Premiership. This is all the more outstanding due to the fact that this is also Brandon Truter’s first season in the Premiership. And Truter is hoping his side’s dream start to the season will continue when Swallows host Chippa United at Dobsonville Stadium today (5pm). Truter, who was once again named Premiership Coach of the Month (December/January) alongside his red hot striker Ruzaigh Gamildien yesterday, said things have not changed. “The mandate has not changed,” Truter stressed. “The mandate was and it is still to survive this season. With what is happening, there’s no pressure. Putting the pressure of winning the league is unnecessary. We just take it one game at the time and that has been our focus and it will remain like that.” Last season, then Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp, won the award three times, becoming the first coach in the then Absa Premiership to do so. But Truter played down trying to emulate or better Middendorp’s record. The German born Middendorp is now in charge of Maritzburg United.
