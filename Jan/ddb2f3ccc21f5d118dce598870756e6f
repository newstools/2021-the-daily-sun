KHAYELITSHA Development Forum chairman Ndithini Tyhido condemned people who occupied land in Khayelitsha and are now selling it. When government ordered the start of lockdown in March last year, there was a spike in land grabs in various kasis around Cape Town. People who claimed to be backyarders occupied land, stating they did not have money to pay rent as they lost their jobs. But some of them are now selling the shacks, with some openly advertising the shacks on Facebook. Tyhido said they condemned the sale of the land in the Khayelitsha CBD. “This land is earmarked for 368 plots for qualifying backyarders from all 13 wards around Khayelitsha,” Tyhido said. He said those who did such undermined the genuine struggles of backyarders, who did not have a place to live. Khayelitsha resident Nosiphiwo Ndzunga (54) said some people have made land grabs a career and have been doing so for years. “There are people with genuine housing problems. There are others who treat land grabs as a career and build shacks to sell or rent them out. It’s like they are in a shack farming business,” she said. Residents also told Daily Sun shacks next to Khayelitsha Mall may lead to an increase in robberies. Athenkosi Phakhathi (28) from Mandela Park in Khayelitsha said people who go to the mall are assumed to be carrying money. “It’s easy for thugs to target and rob shoppers and disappear in between shacks. It is difficult for cops to arrest them,” he said.
