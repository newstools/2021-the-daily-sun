MANY people are angry following the booze ban, but Nwabisa is grateful. Nwabisa Funani from Lower Crossroads kasi in Cape Town said she got stabbed almost every year on New Year’s Eve. But this year she was safe. “The president did a great thing when he banned the sale of alcohol,” she said after showing the SunTeam scars from when she was stabbed in 2016. “I still can’t believe I don’t have any stab wounds this year. Yes, we want to drink. But it worked well for me.” Nwabisa said most people thought she was stabbed while fighting. “This isn’t true. I always get stabbed while trying to stop fights,” she said. Nwabisa can’t bear to see people fighting.  “Every year I tell myself I won’t do it again, but another year comes and there’s a fight and there I am trying to stop them,” she said. “Tell the president I said, ‘Thank you’. He saved me. Maybe this time they were going to stab me to death.” Nwabisa said she only got to explain the origins of the scars when people asked about them. “Sometimes I hear people gossiping and saying I like to fight, but that’s not true,” she said. “I wish people could ask me first before coming to the conclusion that I like to fight. I don’t want anyone to fight, let alone stab others.” Nwabisa said before getting angry at the president, people needed to look at the result of the ban. A resident said Nwabisa was telling the truth that she often tried to stop fights. “I’ve been telling her to let people be because most of the time people are killed while trying to stop a fight,” said the concerned resident.
