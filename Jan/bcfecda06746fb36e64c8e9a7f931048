MARITZBURG United midfielder Daylon Claasen says they have not given up hope despite losing back-to-back matches in the DStv Premiership to TS Galaxy and Orlando Pirates recently. Claasen was encouraged by how they played in those games and says they were unfortunate not to win. Maritzburg looked have turned the corner before those two setbacks having picked up seven points from their previous three matches. Now the Team of Choice have slipped back into the relegation zone following those two defeats. They are third bottom with nine points from 13 games. Claasen is hoping to get back to winning ways when United play Golden Arrows in a Kwa-Zulu Natal derby at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday (5pm). Claasen says this is a do or die game for them because if they fail to pick up maximum points, things could turn ugly. “In the game of football, one has to keep working hard,” said Claasen “We have to give our best and hopefully things will change because we play to win but unfortunately the last two results were disappointing. But we are hoping the match against Arrows goes into our favour.” They face an Arrows side, who lost 4-2 to Cape Town City in their last game. It was coach Mandla Ncikazi’s side first loss this season to end a record of 11 unbeaten games. The Durban-based side are sixth on the table with 19 points from 12 games. This game will see Ncikazi, who had a brief stint with the Maritzburg in 2015-16 season, face his former club for the first time. He has a point to prove against United having turned Abafana Bes’Thende into one of the toughest sides to break down this season. Claasen, who scored when these sides met last January at Harry Gwala Stadium in a 2-1 win for Maritzburg, expects a tough match.
