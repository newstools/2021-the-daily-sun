THEFT has landed a man in hot water. He was found in Sedibeng, Vaal, in possession of copper valued at R4,8 million. He’ll appear in the Vereeniging Magistrate’s Court on Monday, 25 January. Captain Kay Makhubele said the man was suspected to have stolen the copper plates in Vanderbijlpark and De Deur. He said cops received a tip-off on Friday, 22 January about a truck full of copper stolen in Cleveland. The truck was heading to Sedibeng. “The information led the team to Vanderbijlpark, where copper with an estimated value of R3 million was recovered. Information was received that more copper was hidden in De Deur.” Police went to a plot in De Deur, where more copper plates with an estimated value of R1,8 million were recovered. “The suspect will be profiled to determine if he’s not linked to other cases,” said Makhubele. “The investigation is under way as police continue to search for others who may be working with the suspect in committing these crimes.” He said Gauteng police were concerned that criminals were targeting critical infrastructure such as rail and telephone networks. “We call on the community to be on the lookout for those who’re illegally dealing in ferrous and non-ferrous goods and inform police by calling 08600 10111,” he said.
