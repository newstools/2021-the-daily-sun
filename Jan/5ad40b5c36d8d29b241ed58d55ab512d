Actress Thuthuka Mthembu has joined the new stellar cast of Mzansi Magic’s eHostela. She’s switched from her role as sweet innocent Nonka – who had to marry handsome smooth-talker Sbonelo on the SABC1 soapie Uzalo – to the naive Sthandwa on eHostela who’s blissfully unaware of the scavengers in her new surroundings. The actress, whose latest role debuted in the first episode last week, spoke to SunBuzz. “Sthandwa is a humble, soft-spoken girl who left KZN for Gauteng,” she said. “When she gets to Gauteng she meets her mum MaSikhakhane (Andy Mnguni), who abandoned her and her siblings years ago.” Their relationship isn’t good. She resents her mum.

Unfortunately, her secret will eventually come to light.” The 22-year-old actress said people will get to see more of Sthandwa in the coming episodes as her character develops. She said: “People will see the dynamics of her relationship with her mum. As the story unfolds they’ll see why her mum left. Sthandwa befriends Neli (Thandeka Zulu). “Love is also on the cards, but I can’t reveal much about that. Fans should watch the show every Sunday.” The actress is neither leaving Uzalo, nor is she taking a break from the show. “Nonka is still active on Uzalo. I’ve been shooting Uzalo and eHostela at the same time, and things have gone well so far.” Catch Thuthuka on Mzansi Magic every Sunday at 8pm.
