Residents in Old Crossroads in Nyanga are shocked after a teenage girl died in a car crash on Friday morning. An eyewitness told Daily Sun that the driver was speeding and then lost control of the vehicle. “The girls were flung out of the car to the pavement when the car overturned. I really don’t know what was going on with the driver, but the road was clear and doesn’t have potholes,” said Thabo Masonti a taxi driver. When the SunTeam arrived at the scene another 17-year-old girl was being treated while lying on the pavement. Residents who stay in the area said they just heard a huge bang then rushed to the road and found the car upside down. “I saw that the other girl was dead and managed to take a sheet to cover her,” said a resident who did not want to be named. “It seems like she hit her head on the pavement when she was flung out of the car when it overturned. I think these girls were not putting on seatbelts that is why they were thrown out of the car during the incident.” Residents said the road should have a speed hump because taxi drivers always speed because the road is straight and smooth. “There should be speed humps here because kids are hit by speeding taxis and Toyota Avanza drivers here. If the government is not going to do something about it we are going to put up our own speed humps,” said gogo Nosakhele Sigwela (65). Cops spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed the incident. “Please be advised that a case of culpable homicide has been opened for investigation. A 17-year-old girl died in the accident while the driver and another 17-year-old were injured. No one has been arrested so far,” said Rwexana.
