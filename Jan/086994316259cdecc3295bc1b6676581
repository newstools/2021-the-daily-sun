DJ Ganyani, or Master G as he’s affectionately known, needs no introduction. The legendary DJ believes his music speaks volumes about feelings. The three songs he recently released – Tsokombela, Golden Race and Wena – are evidence of this. “All these songs were released during lockdown,” he said. “I released Tsokombela in the middle of last year but haven’t had the chance to promote it. “This particular song speaks about unrequited love. A woman finds herself falling for a man she’s been holding back from. “She reassures him of her love despite her being unsure about it. She’s reluctant to give in.” Tsokombela means immeasurable love in Tsonga, the home language of DJ Ganyani and Birdie, who’s featured on the song. Following Tsokombela, the DJ introduced Golden Race. “I worked with Ceinwen on this song,” he said. “I’m proud to say that through Golden Race, I was able to attract a new market.” The 52-year-old has no intentions of retiring or slowing down. Last month he released yet another sizzling single titled Wena, in which he worked with Holly Rey. “Wena is an upbeat Afro house song in which Holly Rey passionately expresses her love for her significant other, and openly shares the excitement of the love she’s found, assuring him of his position in her life,” he said. DJ Ganyani is known to offer sounds that are mature and powerful in instrumental delivery. “That hasn’t changed. However, I have confidently attempted new sounds to introduce to my fans. “I firmly stand by the evolution of artists, and always try to reach new markets. “This is the motivation behind my ever-changing sound.”
