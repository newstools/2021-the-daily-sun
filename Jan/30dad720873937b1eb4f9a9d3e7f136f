ZAKRIM “Manny Yack” Phiri’s rise to stardom came about because his father was absent from his life. It’s been said that one should channel pain for good, and Manny Yack did just that. He took his pain and redirected it as a driving force to make a success of his talent. He was brought up by a single mum, which made him question a lot of things. He grew up in Ladysmith, KZN. Last Friday he released his debut single, Khumbula.

As a young man I swear to always be there for my daughter.” “In this song, I question why my father left us. I expressed all the sadness, hardships, anger and trauma I experienced in his absence. “I also remind him of all the conflict that occurred whenever he was around.” The song is a mix of R&B and hip hop. “My song explains how, while growing up, most of my friends shared the same experiences of absent fathers,” he said. “While people consider being fatherless the cause of most kids having a sense of loss and confusion, I have a different opinion. “His absence prepared me to be the father I always wished I had. “I’m excited about my debut single and hope it heals people, changes hearts of dads who abandoned kids, and mends broken families.” He’s been featured by Miss Pru, Kid Tini and Dr MaVibes.
