REALITY TV star and property mogul Thato “TT” Mbha has a new TV show. The talented media personality will be presenting Mzansi’s brand new renovation show called Mzansi Cribs Makeover inspired by his own property agency, Mzansi Cribs. The show is aimed at giving back to ordinary South Africans who have made an extraordinary impact in the lives of others. Mbha said: “The idea of the show started a few years back but at the time it was a kitchen makeover show which was turned down and I had to go back to the drawing board. What pushed me into creating this show is when I got into real estate. “I knew that at some point I needed to create something that will be good for the community at large and give back.” ALSO READ:MEYIWAS CALL IN BIG GUN! The 41-year-old star believes that the show came at the right time. “Honestly speaking with what everyone went through last year with the pandemic, the timing of the show is perfect as there’s no better time to be kind to one another and show appreciation than right now,” Mbha told SunBuzz. He said they have received more than 15 nominations and working on the show was humbling for him. “I really got to see how kind-hearted South Africans are,” he said. “For example, in one of the episodes we visited two girls who nominated their grandmother just to thank her for stepping in as a parent when their mother died. “It really touched me, and I am glad I was able to witness that. “We received a lot of nominations and it was overwhelming because we wanted to help everyone, but because we could not raise enough funds, we only assisted 13 people. “I hope to help more because my dream is to take it nationally,” he said. The show is starting on 28 January and will air on Mzansi Magic.
