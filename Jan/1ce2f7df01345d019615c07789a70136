THE community of Ackerville in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga, braved the rain to bid farewell to late minister in the presidency, Jackson Mthembu. They lined the streets, singing struggle songs and saluting the hearse as it carried his body to his final resting place on Sunday, 24 January. Mthembu died on Thursday of Covid-19-related complications. The family performed a ritual and the ANC flag was handed over to them.  Only 50 people, including family and friends, President Cyril Ramaphosa, Deputy President David Mabuza and cabinet members attended the service. Community members told Daily Sun they were pained to not attend his funeral but understood they had to abide by Covid-19 regulations. George Mahlangu said he’d have loved to attend the funeral, so he decided to salute Mthembu in the streets. “This is my way of saying goodbye to a leader of the people,’’ he said. “Jackson was a man of the people who didn’t misuse his position. “He was respectful and friendly with everyone regardless of their status. This is a sad day for the community – we’ve lost a true leader.” Mantombi Ntuli said they were grateful to have shared their lives with Mthembu. Bandile Ndlovu said they’d remember him as a different leader.
