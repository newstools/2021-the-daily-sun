FORMER Punch Security Project workers are demanding their salaries. About 60 security guards protested outside Tshwane University of Technology’s Soshanguve South campus, Tshwane, this week. Samuel Mabunda (40) told Daily Sun the company has been sending them from pillar to post since last month. He said the company owed them at least R3 500 each. They said they started working at the company around 2018. “We’re also demanding our salaries from Tshwane University Technology Soshanguve South campus. We’re demanding from the institution because we worked day and night shifts at their premises. The security company promised to pay our salaries on 23 December. “We were surprised only their permanent workers got paid,” he said.  The workers, who started protesting on Monday, 18 January, said they wanted their money urgently as they were suffering and starving. Protester Sana Mokoena (34) said their salaries were reduced without any explanation when they were supposed to get an increase. She said they’d protest until their grievances were heard. The company’s manager, David Thusago, said: “I don’t speak to strangers. I only speak to people personally and face to face. In fact, where did you get my number?” TUT spokeswoman Willa de Ruyter said the university was aware of the protest action. “Since TUT is contractually bound to engage with the company and not employees, TUT is engaging with the company to resolve the issues raised by their employees.”
