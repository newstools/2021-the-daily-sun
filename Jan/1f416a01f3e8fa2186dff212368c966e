An induna (headman) has been arrested in connection with the murder of a man who was set on fire in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the man, 58, was arrested on Sunday afternoon and will join three other people who are charged with the murder and kidnapping of a man in Melmoth last month. "His arrest follows the killing of Nkosi Xulu (26). It is alleged that on 13 December 2020 at 13:00 a 26-year-old man was kidnapped from his home at Emasangweni in Melmoth. He was allegedly set alight by the suspects," Gwala said. Xulu was rushed to hospital and later died there. Three brothers, Mankomane Biyela, Njabulo Biyela and Phiwayinkosi Biyela were initially arrested and appeared in the Melmoth Magistrate's Court on 22 December. They will be back in court on Tuesday alongside the induna.
