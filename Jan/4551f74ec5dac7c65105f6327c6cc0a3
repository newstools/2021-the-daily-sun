PASTORS want President Cyril Ramaphosa to lift church closures in seven working days or face court. Pastors met at Church Square in the Tshwane CBD on Friday, 22 January under the banner Pastors Against Church closure. They prayed under police guard before 10 of them were taken to the Union Buildings to deliver a memorandum. Spokesman Pastor Moafrika Maila said the closure affected pastors financially, but that wasn’t the main reason for the protest. “People who work in churches such as gardeners, cleaners and workers are also suffering. Our members are still faithful with their tithes and offerings but other people are suffering.” He said it couldn’t be right that they were called to officiate at funerals but were banned from congregating. If allowed to open they’d toe the line. “People are in pain after losing loved ones and need pastors to preach and help them heal.” Bishop Kelly Montsho said the council only spoke to the Council of Churches, which didn’t represent everyone. Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng of Incredible Happenings Ministry said: “There are huge crowds at malls. There is no social distancing at Sassa but we get banned. The devil is out to destroy Christianity so people have nowhere to run to.”  He said government was protecting people while unknowingly opening the way for evil. “People will die like flies every day and we’ll blame Covid-19 when it’s actually evil forces. There’s no prayer, prophecy and fasting.” He encouraged people to continue sanitising, social distancing and wearing masks. Pastor Johaness Sithole of Mountain of Zion Church asked how the battle could be won while God was shut out. Prophet Ayanda Vilakazi of Faithful Followers of Christ said: “People have been attacked for praying. We saw it in Sebokeng.”
