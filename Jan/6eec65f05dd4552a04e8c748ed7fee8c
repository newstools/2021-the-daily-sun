THE Western Cape health department is contacting 20 passengers who were on a bus from the Eastern Cape on Saturday, 2 January, when one of them collapsed and died of Covid-19. The department’s Mark van der Heever said they were made of aware of the incident and requested a list of passengers to follow up with close contacts. He said anyone who has information about who was on the bus should respect their privacy. The list consists of about 30 names who were on the bus when the passenger died. A Cape Town resident told Daily Sun the dead person was travelling to Philippi. “The passenger died as soon as they arrived in Beaufort-West where they stopped to refresh,” said the residents. According to reports, the deceased got on to the bus in Tsomo, Eastern Cape, and soon started complaining of shortness of breath. Khayelitsha Development Forum chairman Ndithing Tyhido urged community members who know someone who was on the bus to advise them to go for a Covid-19 test.  “We are encouraging the health department to trace everyone who may have been in contact with passengers.” The SunTeam tried to get hold of the bus company, Jobela Bus Services, with no luck. Luyanda Gqola (34) said someone posted the list of passengers on social media., which she said was the right thing to do. “I don’t see anything wrong with that because people were not going to come forward,” she said. Another resident said the virus was dangerous and needed to be taken seriously. “This affects everyone. We will talk about privacy at some other time. Social media made things quick and easy,” said the resident.
