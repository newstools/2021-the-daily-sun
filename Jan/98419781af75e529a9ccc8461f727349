SAFA President, Dr Danny Jordaan emphasised the need for all national teams to do well on international level in order to fulfil the Association’s Vision 2022 blueprint. Addressing a Bafana Bafana technical team workshop on Sunday, 24 January 2021 at SAFA House, Dr Jordaan said most of the national teams had done extremely well and the icing on the cake would be for the senior men’s national team to qualify for both the CAF Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and FIFA World Cup in Qatar. He also urged all coaches to scout for South African players plying their trade in Europe and who are eligible to play for South Africa. ‘’There are so many players born in South Africa and some who have South African heritage who qualify to play for our national teams. Let’s go to Europe and identify them. They can only make our national teams stronger,” he said. The two-day workshop which ran from 23-24 January was attended by among others, Bafana Bafana coach, Molefi Ntseki and his entire technical and support staff. Also in attendance was u23 coach David Notoane and Technical Director, Frans Mogashoa. SAFA
