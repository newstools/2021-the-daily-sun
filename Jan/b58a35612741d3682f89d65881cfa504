SUPERSPORT United and Mamelodi Sundowns played to a goalless draw in a top-of-the-table clash in the DStv Premiership on Saturday afternoon. Sundowns star midfielder Gaston Sirino made his first appearance for the 2020-21 Premiership as he started the encounter after missing the past 10 games for Sundowns. There were not too many goal scoring opportunitiesâ€š as both goalkeepers Ronwen Williams and Denis Onyango were not really tested for the better half of the match. This was the first time since September 2012 that the Pretoria rivals have played out to goalless draw in the league encounter. The result means Sundowns remain top of the standings with United second (this was before Swallows FC match against Baroka). In 11 matches, Sundowns have gathered 25 points while their rivals SuperSport have 23 with the same number of matches played. The two teams will now be hoping to put behind the not so impressive displays and hope for maximum points in their next outings where Sundowns will host Bloemfontein Celtic on Tuesday, while United will be welcoming AmaZulu the following day at Lucas Moripe Stadium.
