The DStv Premiership match between Bloemfontein Celtic and Chippa United scheduled for Dr Molemela Stadium on Wednesday was  cancelled due to a waterlogged pitch as a result of heavy rain. Match commissioner Enock Molefe told Supersport TV that referee Victor Hlongwane made a decision to call the game off as the heavy downpour is expected to continue until Friday. Said Molefe: “We had a brief from the referee and made a decision to call the game off. We can’t delay kickoff because the Mangaung Municipality advised us that there will be heavy rain from now until Friday. "There was no hope for the ball rolling and ho hope to hold back (the decision).” In a brief statement the Premier Soccer League (PSL) also confirmed and said they will announce a new date for this fixture in due course.
