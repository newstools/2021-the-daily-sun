AFTER a two-year hiatus from SABC1’s prime-time soapie Skeem Saam, actor Nicholas Nkuna is back to reprise his role as the hunky Sakhile Mkhize. The heart-throb, who also stars as Dr Fikani on SABC2’s 7de Laan, told Daily Sun that he was not leaving the Afrikaans soapie. “Skeem Saam is like home to me – we’ve been together for six years now. We tell real South African stories that are inspirational, and this is always a pleasure,” he said. He said that he would not leave 7de Laan because his role on Skeem Saam was recurring.

Having two jobs when some of his industry peers were unable to work meant a lot to him. “I’m blessed because I’ve always worked hard and slept less hours. I pray hard and dedicate myself and gifts to whatever project I take on. I thank God for these opportunities. Hopefully, the Covid-19 vaccine will get the country running again, restoring people’s jobs, joy, well-being and dreams – especially my fellow entertainers who are having a hard time right now,” the Mpumalanga-born actor said.
