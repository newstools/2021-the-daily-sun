LIVHALANI Sinyosi told Daily Sun her victory is for South Africa, and one everyone should be proud of. Sinyosi, the Limpopo Principal who won the African Union Continental Teacher Prize 2020, said: “I thank God for this award bestowed on me. It was not an easy journey as I was competing with different countries.” Limpopo MEC for Education, Polly Boshileo was thrilled that Sinyosi, the principal of Dzata Secondary School in Nzhelele East, won the award. The winners were announced during a virtual ceremony held on 21 December with the theme, Schools as development hubs to empower teachers after Covid-19. “Such enormous recognition does not come easy, and should be appreciated as a testament of selfless determination and excellence,” said Boshielo. “This has not been an easy academic year but because of the men and women who manage our schools and overcome obstacles presented by prevailing resource challenges and Covid-19, we pulled through,” said Boshielo. Sinyosi was the 2019 district and provincial winner of the National Teacher Awards in Secondary School Leadership. This led to her being nominated for this prize by the Department of Basic Education. She has been in education for 25 years, where she has worked as a teacher, departmental head, deputy principal and now principal. Sinyosi, a mother of four, holds a Masters degree and is currently a PhD student at Unisa. Sinyosi received the award for having demonstrated qualities in engaging in quality teaching and helping students to achieve long-term career goals.
