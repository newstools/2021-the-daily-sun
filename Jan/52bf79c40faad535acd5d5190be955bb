IF you thought there’s pressure to win at Mamelodi Sundowns, wait until you arrive at Al Ahly. That is pretty much the sentiment from Pitso Mosimane as he prepares to take his team to the Fifa Club World Cup. The Egyptian giants have been paired with Al Duhail in the second round (previously the quarter-final round) of Club World Cup, with the Qatari hosts being afforded a bye from the first round after New Zealanders Auckland City pulled out last week. The winner of the match will face Uefa Champions League cup-holders Bayern Munich in the semi-finals. Even though Mosimane is salivating at the prospect of a battle with the German giants, he is not oblivious to the huge expectations from the fickle Al Ahly fans. “In Egypt, they don’t say go do your best. There’s nothing like that with Al Ahly. They say go and win the Club World Cup. I said ‘guys are we being realistic here?’ “There’s a Bayern in front of me. They say, ‘my friend, you don’t believe you can win it, so why you go there?’ “It is more than what Bill Shankly once said. It is not about life and death. In Egypt, it’s more than that.” TP Mazembe and Raja Casablanca are the only two African teams to finish as runners-up in the World Cup final, and Mosimane admitted that has continuously put pressure on Ahly to also achieve the feat. “Mazembe has put a lot of pressure on us reaching the final. Everybody says if Mazembe can do it, we can do it,” added Mosimane. “Everybody who is going to the Club World Cup believes he has a chance. You have to be positive here. Of course, everything is doable. We’ll go there and fight for it, but we also have to be realistic.” Despite not losing a match in 18 outings, Mosimane remains under pressure, scrutiny and criticism, mostly from Egyptian football legends. But he has refused to make things personal. Instead, he has chosen to roll with the punches. The Club World Cup will kick off on 4 February, with both the Education City and Ahmad Bin Ali Stadiums set to hosts matches.
