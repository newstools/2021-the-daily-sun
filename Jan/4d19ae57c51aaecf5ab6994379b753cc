COVID-19 HAS forced them out of the bushes and into residential houses. They stand at the gates, showing lots of leg and wearing heavy make-up and weaves. THEY ARE THE LADIES OF THE STREET – AND THEY’RE WORKING FROM HOME. Those who use the services of magoshas in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, have two streets where they can do business with the ladies of the night. A group of magoshas rent unused houses. Their clients no longer want to use the bushes because of Covid-19. A magosha told Daily Sun it’s hard for clients to reach them near the bushes as they’re afraid of getting caught on the road after 9pm. But while this may be paradise for magoshas and their clients, residents don’t like their new arrangements. PYTHON EATS PREGANT DOG! They accuse magoshas of enticing their husbands and setting a bad example for the kids. They’re also not happy with the way the ladies dress. They say it’s a problem for magoshas to do their business in a residential area. “They wear skimpy clothes. Some are even naked with only a gown on top,” said a resident. They said there’s a school near the houses and the ladies distract pupils in the area. “How are kids supposed to play outside while women are half-naked, asking men to join them in their houses?” said another resident. “This makes our area dirty. We’re tired of it.” KOROBELA LEFT ME SINGLE! The magoshas told Daily Sun they stand at their gates to attract clients because they’re working from home. “That’s what the president told us to do. So here we are at home waiting for our clients,” said one of them. “People must mind their own businesses. Everyone has a job, and this one is ours. We’re not doing anything but just standing at our gates.” The magoshas charge the same amount for their services, which they didn’t want to disclose. They didn’t increase prices as clients were hit hard by lockdown. They share the rental bill among themselves. One of the clients said: “You get any woman of your choice here: different shapes and sizes.”
