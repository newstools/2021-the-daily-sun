TS GALAXY coach Owen Da Gama is demanding more from his players after recording his first victory since he’s joined the club. Da Gama led The Rockets to a 3-0 away win defeating Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday. This was Galaxy second win in 12 matches of the DStv Premiership, with their last being in October last year. The former Highlands Park coach gave credit to players such as Lindokuhle Mbatha, Mxolisi Macuphu and Luckyboy Mokoena who played an influential role on their match against The Team of Choice. “Upfront Mxolisi (Macuphu) did very well, Mbatha made us tick, Luckyboy (Mokoena) made us play but we still got a lot of work to do,” Da Gama said. “It was a great result for the team, we will keep on trying, working hard. If we don’t concede we can win any game.” This was Galaxy’s first win this year. Da Gama said team spirit was key for them to win the match against Maritzburg. He said: “We worked a lot on confidence and encouragement. These are our children they make mistakes but it is how you react to a mistake, you got to be creative… when the going gets tough you have to be creative.” Galaxy will next be in action on Tuesday where they visit Orlando Stadium to face Orlando Pirates. Their weekend clash against Bloemfontein Celtic was postponed due to the Free Staters’ Caf Confederation Cup commitments. “Every time you play a big team like Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs or Mamelodi Sundowns they help us go to another level. “We take it one match at a time, all teams in the PSL are good. You cannot undermine or overestimate any team. You got to apply yourself as best as possible.” After 12 matches Galaxy are sitting in position 12 in thePremiership standings with 11 points.
