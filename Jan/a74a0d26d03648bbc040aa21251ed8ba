PASSENGERS who use bakkies as transportation in rural areas are at risk of contracting the coronavirus. They mostly are cramped in the back of bakkies. Passenger Mazangwa Dakana (43) from Buhlungwana, Eastern Cape, told Daily Sun:“Our lives are at risk, but we don’t have a choice. “It’s hot inside the vans and some people don’t even bother to wear masks. “Drivers should at least reduce the number of passengers from 13 to seven.” Driver Mzaza Vuyani (42) appealed to passengers to follow Covid-19 rules. Transport spokesman, Unathi Binqose, said the department would send more officials to enforce regulations among bakkies. “Bakkies are not allowed to transport people in South Africa due to many reasons,” he said. “One, they don’t have safety features, particularly for those sitting at the back of the bakkie.” Binqose said people use this form of transport to make money and to travel to town and clinics, but he urged them to follow regulations. He said: “Wearing a mask is mandatory. Although public transportation is allowed to load at full capacity, we appeal to people to comply with Covid-19 regulations.”
