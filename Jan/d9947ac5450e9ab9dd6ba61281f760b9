EASTERN Cape police arrested a bogus doctor and her alleged boyfriend for fraud. They were arrested on Thursday 21 January on charges of practising without qualifications and dispensing medication without licences in Molteno in the Eastern Cape. Police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said: “The woman was arrested by a joint operation involving police and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority. “Police received information in September 2020 about a doctor who was practising without a licence and operating as a medical doctor in Molteno.  “The reports further alleged that she was not registered with the Health Professional Council of South Africa, but nonetheless was dispensing medication to patients since 2018,” he said “An operation dubbed ‘Operation Corona’ was conducted by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority Unit and police. Consequently, the two suspects were found doing business in their surgery and were immediately arrested by the police. One of the two suspects, the assistant, is believed to be a boyfriend to the bogus doctor.” Medication estimated to worth R700 000 as well as used and unused needles for injection were confiscated during the raid conducted in the surgery and bogus doctor’s house. Kinana said: “The two suspects aged between 33 and 40 are expected to appear in the Queenstown Magistrates Court today.”
