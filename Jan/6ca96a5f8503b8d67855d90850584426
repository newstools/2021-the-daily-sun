At times our government leaves much to be desired. I was really disturbed by the rumours that the Department of Social Development wants to stop the disability grants of our loved ones. I don’t think officials understand the struggles our families and friends go through. They also don’t know how some of them are ill-treated by their fellow residents. How on earth would anyone suggest cutting their disability grant? None of those people chose to be in the situation they find themselves in. If our government is indeed a government for the people, they should serve the people and respect those living with disabilities. Letter by Happy Monakhisi, Mohlabaneng Village
