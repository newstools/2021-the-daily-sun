THE rubbish on the back of the bakkie tasted like sugar, so the three toddlers ate it – and now they are dead. They didn’t know that the rubbish was soaked in rat poison taken from a shack by one of the tenants. On Tuesday, 19 January, angry residents from Winnie Mandela in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni went to the house to demand to know who placed the rubbish in the bakkie, but no one was prepared to take the blame. That night some tenants packed their belongings and fled. WHY AFRICAN WOMEN LOVE SOIL! Mastandi Nomiya Chauke (48) lost two grandchildren – Tina Maswanganyi (3) and Julia Mthombeni (4). Chauke said the rubbish was placed on the bakkie, which had no canopy and the kids climbed over the tailgate to play inside the bakkie. “They found the sugar and bread crumbs laced with rat poison.” Chauke said she had to rush home after receiving a call from her daughter about the kids vomiting and crying in pain. They were taken to hospital, but sadly died. Trymore Runesi (25) said his son, Tendai (3), complained of stomach pains and his mother rushed him to the clinic, but he died before he could get there. He said he didn’t know how he was going to raise money to bury his child. “I was working with a contractor but due to lockdown, we were told to stop coming as there was no work,” he said. “I’m devastated. I wish I could wake him up, but I can’t,” he said. Both families appealed to SunReaders to help them bury the kids. Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha said inquest cases were opened and cops were investigating.
