THE family of a woman hacked to death and burnt on Saturday, wants justice. Gogo Doris Mahlangu (80), a traditional leader from Mbuzini Village in the Nkomazi area of Mpumalanga, was attacked by a killer mob. Her grandson Bongani Shabalala (32) said a group of people arrived at her house at night and dragged her out. He said he received a call from family members and got his brothers to drive to the gogo’s house, but it was too late. They found her house burning with her inside. “My grandmother was a known traditional leader. The people in this area know her and have never seen her do strange things. It hurts us as a family that she had to die like this.” Bongani said he and his family wanted the suspects to pay for what they did. He said it was clear they didn’t have remorse as community members went to the house on Monday and tried to harass the family.  Bongani said his gogo was a loving person and would never hurt anyone, even if she was provoked. He said the family planned to bury her on Saturday, 16 January. On Monday, 11 January, police arrested four suspects aged between 22 and 44 in connection with the murder. A fifth suspect was bust yesterday. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that five people were bust and charged with murder and arson. “They are all expected to appearin the Tonga Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 13 January. We continue to call for stability in the community of Mbuzini.” He said cops were expected to make more arrests soon.
