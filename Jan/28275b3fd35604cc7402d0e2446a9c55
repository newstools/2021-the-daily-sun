ORLANDO Pirates claimed the Soweto Derby bragging rights when they registered a 2-1 victory over Kaizer Chiefs at Orlando Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Amakhosi had a promising start to the match as they seemed to be the better team in the early exchanges of the match. The likes of Kearyn Baccus and Samir Nurkovic created couple of chances but they were not clinical enough to bury them. Thembinkosi Lorch scored the opening goal to put his side in the 37th minutes as they went to the break Pirates leading. In the second half ChiefsÂ  made their first substitution with Happy Mashiane replacing Nkosingiphile Ngcobo. Mashiane's made an impact as he managed to win his side a penalty in the 51st minute as he was brought down in the penalty area. Nurkovic stepped up but his powerful shot was impressively parried by Richard Ofori with the rebound falling to Siyabonga Ngezana who missed the target. Substitute Siphesihle Ndlovu doubled Pirates lead in the 80th minutes, however Amakhosi managed to pull one through Daniel Cardoso. Chefs coach Gavin Hunt said they could have easily won the match. "We should have won the game quite comfortably, what more do you want me to say? That's it. I thought we did well," Hunt told SuperSport TV. "The chances they cleared off the line, I don't know how many they cleared off the line, so we did well you know. That's it. I can't fault the players."I thought the second goal was poor from our side, there's only one winner here, we should have won the game."
