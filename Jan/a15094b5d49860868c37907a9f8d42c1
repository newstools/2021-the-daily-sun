KAIZER Chiefs young guns Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Happy Mashiane inspired Amakhosi to a 2-1 win over Cape Town City in a DStv Premiership encounter. This was Amakhosi's first back-to-back wins of the season following a poor start of the season which saw the club at some point sitting in position 14 on the log, which was the worst in the club history. Following on from their midweek win over AmaZulu, the Amakhosi got the better of the Citizens to climb to log to position eight. This was their third win of the season and without a doubt it has relived coach Gavin Hunt as his start at the club has not been a fruitful one. Ngcobo was the first to find the back of the net, putting Amakhosi in the lead just after seven minutes of the game following good work by Philani Zulu down the left flank ended with Ngcobo scoring. Things got even better for the Amakhosi on 19 minutes when they doubled their advantage through Mashinane's happy feet. City looked to work themselves back into contention and, to their credit, were patient in their passing play through the remainder of the first half. They created a good chance on 39 minutes when a free kick delivery found the head of Thamsanqa Mkhize, but his glancing effort flashed wide of the far post. The two sides went to the break with Amakhosi leading 2-0. The Citizens came back stronger and were more dominant team in the second half. They threw everything they had at Chiefs and were rewarded on 83rd minutes when Fagrie Lakay pulled one back to make it 2-1. City almost levelled in injury time when Craig Martin had space on the right of the penalty area but saw his low shot shave the outside of the far post, leaving Chiefs to take home a full haul of points. The teams will return to DStv Premiership action this coming midweek, with Chiefs at home to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila on Tuesday while City visiting Black Leopards on Wednesday.
