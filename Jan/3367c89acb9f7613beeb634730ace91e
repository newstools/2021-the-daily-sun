FAMILY and friends paid their last respects to Sibonokuhle Ndesana yesterday. The 19-year-old from Browns Farm, Philippi in Cape Town was killed, allegedly by her boyfriend. The incident happend on Christmas Day. Sibonokuhle left home on the fateful day to visit her boyfriend and her body was found in his room the following day. Her aunt Phakama Ndesana said the boyfriend’s family helped pay for the funeral. “We are grateful for what they did but I hope their son is arrested soon. He must pay for what he did to Sibonokuhle,” she said. Phakama said the reason so many women were being killed by their partners was that the law was not applied to them. “They know nothing will happen to them. Women are being killed every day but we never hear about the harsh sentences.” Sibonokuhle’s friend, Lunathi Matiwane, (21) said she was like a sister to her. “I still can’t believe she was killed by someone who was supposed to protect her.” Lunathi said until the government came up with a plan to deal with killers, women would continue living in fear. “I was shocked when I heard he was let go because the cops said there was no evidence,” she said. Resident Sonwabise Matu (24) said women had showed their anger but the murders continue. “We even marched to Parliament but it didn’t help. The government is failing us. We have to fight back,” she said. Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said the boyfriend was released because there wasn’t enough evidence. “He was not brought before the court. Once more evidence has been gathered an arrest could be made,” he said.
