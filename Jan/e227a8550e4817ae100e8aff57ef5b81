The trial of two Kruger National Park rangers has been postponed for further investigations. The accused, Lucky Mkansi and Joel Sihlangu, appeared before the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga on Thursday 29 January. They both said they intend to plead not guilty to three counts of conspiracy to commit crime and possession of rhino horn. The crime reportedly happened at the crocodile bridge section at Kruger in Mpumalanga between 25 and 29 December 2018. Environmental crime investigator Lindiwe Khosa told the court her colleague arrived at her office with accused number two, Sihlangu. “My colleagues informed me that the accused wanted to talk to me about the incident that took place from 25 to 29 December but I was not aware of the alleged crime at the time,” said Khosa. “He introduced himself and told me that between the 25th and 29th they were on duty at the crocodile bridge section of the park. He told me he was then approached by accused one, Lucky Mkansi, who tried to convince him about a deal to bring poachers into the park to hunt for rhinos.” Khosa told the court Sihlangu told her that at first he didn’t agree as he feared losing his job but Mkansi was allegedly persuasive so he changed his mind. “He said Mkansi was on a call with poachers and they used a state vehicle to fetch the poachers to enter the park. “I then took the accused to our commander where he confessed and I was told to interview other the field ranger, Mkansi, who was taken to the commander for confession,” said Khosa. Prosecutor Lot Mgiba has asked the matter to be postponed for more state witnesses to be called. Magistrate Majaji Ngobeni postponed the matter until 2 March 2021.
