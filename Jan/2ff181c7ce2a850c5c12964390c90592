Two people were locked inside a car and burnt to death, allegedly for stock theft in Mputi locality in Bhaziya in the Eastern Cape. It is alleged the two men were driving a bakkie towing trailer loaded with cattle which were allegedly bought at Xhongora location and being taken to Ngcobo on Sunday 3 January. According to the local chief’s spokesman Sipho Joyi, the two were found in possession of four cattle which were allegedly stolen. The men’s bakkie experienced a problem in the Mputi locality as the trailer fell off the vehicle and the cattle escaped, running all over the veld. While they were checking the cattle and loading them back on to the trailer, a resident spotted them and accused them of stock theft and later alarmed the entire community. The angry Mputi residents trapped the two in their own bakkie and burnt them beyond recognition. Joyi told Daily Sun stock theft is an everyday topic in the village. “The stock theft rate is increasing daily here and it’s very concerning. Residents are now fed up,” said Joyi. In a video, the angry residents are seen turning away a police vehicle which was there to calm down the situation. Eastern Cape police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni said two cases of murder and malicious damage to property have been opened and are currently under investigation and no arrests have been made. Meanwhile, the Eastern Cape provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga has issued a strong warning against anyone who takes the law into their own hands. She urged residents to report crimes to the police.
