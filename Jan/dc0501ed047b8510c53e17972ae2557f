LIMPOPO Education MEC Polly Boshielo is happy with the progress at matric marking centres. She made her first monitoring visit to the centre at Northern Academy Primary School in Polokwane on Monday. The MEC was scheduled to visit other centres throughout the week to check that Covid-19 regulations were being followed. “It is great that all our markers are adhering to regulations. “It’s our wish to complete our tasks without recording any cases or deaths,” she said. The MEC said the centre at the school was the largest in the province. “More than 80 markers and assistants are stationed at the centre, and that gives the department the huge task of ensuring that everything goes smoothly. “These are tough times and we are all called upon to do our part in managing the spread of the virus. We encourage our markers to stay focused and ensure we emerge from this process safe and sound, having done a credible job.” Boshielo said marking was divided into two sessions. “The first batch of scripts was attended to by 1 127 markers in December. The second started on 6 January and ends on the 18th,” she said. She said all markers were taken through health protocols as part of their orientation. “These include steps to be followed in the event of a suspected or confirmed positive case.” Boshielo said marking was observed by unions and the Provincial Education Labour Relations Council at all 24 centres in the province. “These union representatives also form part of daily centre progress meetings to aid the smooth running of the process,” she added.
