In the final hours of 2020 all the computers at the Sapphire Secondary School in Vanderbijlpark were stolen. The school received a donation from MTN and Huawei for a computer laboratory in September. From photos of the scene, it appears that the thieves gained access to the computer laboratory by making a hole in the wall underneath a window. Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi, tweeted about the break-in on Friday. His spokesperson, Steve Mabona, confirmed the break in to News24 and said that all the computers were stolen and that these were the computers that were donated in September. Mabona said 42 computers were stolen, and the break in happened before midnight. This project was recently launched by MEC @Lesufi in collaboration with @MTNza sadly criminals, stole these equipments, sad indeed. @educationgp @GautengHealth #GGT2030 pic.twitter.com/aUUj3IdUes When South Africa entered its first lockdown in March last year, there was a spate of schools break ins.
