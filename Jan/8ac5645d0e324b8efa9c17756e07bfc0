UNDER current lockdown regulations public gatherings are not allowed, leaving the entertainment industry in a difficult situation. Award-winning musician Sjava, whose real name is Jabulani Hadebe, told Daily Sun after gigs dried up he went back home to Bergville, KZN. “I decided to go back home until things return to some kind of normal because at this stage, I’m not being booked and I’m suffering, just like every other artist,” he said. “I’ll return to Jozi when things start getting better, when I can be booked again.” The Eweni singer said he hoped government would open night clubs so artists could get bookings. “I have to be honest. This has hit me hard in the pocket. Bills are piling up and there is nothing I can do about it. Going home was really the only option for me.” Sjava, who stars in eHostela, said he had an album out, but relied on gigs. “A big part of any artist’s income are bookings and gigs, so not working for this long has really affected me financially,” he said. “I don’t know when this will all end, but I feel like food is being taken out of my mouth as an artist.” The entertainer told the SunTeam he hoped for good news in February, when the president addresses the nation. “I hope artists will at least get to work. We couldn’t do anything during the festive season. “If we had at least worked during the festive season we’d be okay financially, but we’re not,” he said.
