THE intensity of the Okae Molao operations is yielding positive results. About 650 suspects were bust for various crimes on Wednesday and Thursday. Speaking to Daily Sun, Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela said he was happy their efforts succeeded. He said he wanted to emphasise that the operations weren’t only meant for the festive season, hence the continuation. “We know criminals thought they would have a breather since the festive has passed, but that’s not the case. “We still need order in our communities,” said Mawela. He said he was happy with the 113 gender-based violence arrests. “We heard the complaints of women saying they are only paid attention to during the 16 Days of Activism. So now we want to reassure them that their tears weren’t shed in vain.” Mawela said women and children were a priority and they’d continue working hard to create safe spaces for them. “Overall, I’m happy with today’s road block. We impounded four vehicles whose number plates did not match their license discs. We’ve also arrested a man whose gun appears to be a duplicate on our system. Our biggest concern was that he carried live ammunition and has no license,” said Mawela. He said they would continue with their clean-up operations, making sure criminals didn’t find comfort on the streets.
