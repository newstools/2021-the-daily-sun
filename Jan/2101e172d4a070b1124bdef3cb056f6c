“UMQOMBOTHI is for our ancestors. Amadlozi are thirsty and
angry because they are not drinking umqombothi.” These were the words of traditional healers who have pleaded
with President Cyril Ramaphosa to allow the production of traditional beer. The sangomas told Daily Sun their ancestors had been
pleading for umqombothi since December. Sangoma Thabitha “Mahambayedwa”
Sibanyoni from Ga-Motla in North West said the ancestors were angry and didn’t
want excuses any more. She said they had lost communication with the ancestors
over this. “We don’t even know our future as sangomas because we can’t
communicate with our ancestors in an effective way,” she said.  Sangoma Kgothatso “Ubabamahlabezulu” Sibanyoni (21) said she
didn’t dream any more because her ancestors were angry. She said people didn’t
understand that sangomas couldn’t heal people when the ancestors were angry. Traditional healer Misheck Nkambule from Mamelodi, Tshwane,
said traditional beer also kept communities united. Archbishop and Prophet Jan Sibanyoni of the Christian Church
of God said: “I don’t see why traditional healers are not allowed to make umqombothi
as they are not doing it for business.” Madala Samson Jankie Seopa (67) from Ga-Motla said he loved
umqombothi.  “This is our traditional beer and it’s difficult to live
without it. To me, it’s like pap,” he said. Sangoma Matshaya Tutu (39) from Philippi in Cape Town said
the booze ban made it impossible to perform some rituals. “All the ancestors want is their job to be done. They don’t
know anything about the lockdown. We had to beg them for a grace period,” he
said. He said it was disrespectful to set a date with the
ancestors for rituals and to keep postponing it. “What makes it bad is that when the president addresses us
again, we don’t know what he will say. It’s frustrating for us sangomas. Other
doctors are allowed to work but we are not given respect,” he said.
