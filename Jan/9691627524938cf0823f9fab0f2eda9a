WHAT started as an attempted robbery at a petrol station in Braamfischer, Soweto, ended in a shoot-out that left four dead on Friday. After cops responded to the attempted robbery, they chased the suspects to Rockville where a shoot-out ensued. Colonel Athlenda Mathe said a team, made up of members of the crime intelligence and national intervention units, responded to intelligence that an attack on a cash van was being planned. The team noticed two suspicious-looking vehicles following a cash-in-transit car to the station, where security officials were set to collect money from ATMs. “Upon noticing the police the two vehicles, with a group of armed robbers, made an about-turn, resulting in a high-speed chase,” she said. “Hot on their heels, the team followed the cars to an identified address in the area, where a shoot-out ensued.” Mathe said four suspects were shot dead while others fled the scene. Two rifles and a pistol were recovered. Mathe said it couldn’t be ruled out that the suspects were linked to other robberies in and around Gauteng. “Members of the public who may have seen or know the whereabouts of these suspects are urged to contact their nearest police station or the CrimeStop number on 08600 10111,” she said. National police commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, commended the cops. “We’re hoping to apprehend the remaining suspects with the implementation of the 72-hour activation plan to mobilise all resources,” said Sitole.
