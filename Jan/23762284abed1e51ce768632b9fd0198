STRUGGLING Baroka coach Matsimela Thoka has vowed he has a plan to upset DStv Premiership champions and log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns at Peter Mokaba Stadium, Polokwane tomorrow afternoon (3pm). Baroka come into this clash without a win in their last three league matches, losing two and drawing one, while the Tshwane giants are still to taste a league defeat this season. The 10 times PSL champions and 2016 African Champions League champions have won six and drawn three in the current Premiership campaign. And the under pressure Thoka is positive that despite his side’s poor recent form, Bakgaga will be the first team to beat the Brazilians. “Sundowns are champions and everyone knows that they have a quality team and that is why they are leading,” said Thoka. “But at Baroka we are not scared of any big teams. “In fact, every time we play against a big team we produce our best performances and we beat them. “ I have seen an attitude I have not seen from the boys for a while ahead of this game. “The atmosphere is fantastic at training and everyone is motivated to play Downs and want to be in the team. It will be a tough game, but we just have to be smart to beat Sundowns.” But truth is, Thoka’s defence needs to be at their best if they are to stop Downs midfielder Themba Zwane, who has been a nightmare to PSL defenders this season and has netted seven goals so far. Asked about his future with Baroka, Thoka, who took over the helm from the sacked Dylan Kerr at the beginning of the season, said: “I am happy at Baroka and I have the full support from the chairman Khurishi Mphahlele and the team. “So my focus is on my team and the coming game.”
