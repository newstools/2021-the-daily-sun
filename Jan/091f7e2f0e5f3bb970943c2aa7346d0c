AFTER a tough 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, lockdown and a temporary halt on sporting activities, two Eastern Cape boxing personalities Lonki Witbooi and Thembelani Gopheni hope for a better New Year. The two East London boxing figures are praying the number of infections decrease so that they can see more boxing action. All the boxing tournaments scheduled for Eastern Cape last year were cancelled due to the high numbers of infections in the province. Witbooi, an up-and-coming boxing manager, handles the affairs of fighters such as the World Boxing Organisation (WBO) intercontinental junior bantamweight Yanga Sigqibo, SA junior featherweight contender Mhlanganisi Sogcwayi, and Sikho Moshani. “Boxing was badly affected last year due to the rising numbers of infections. “So my hope this year is that the numbers of infections will go down so that we resume with boxing so that boxers can make a living, as it’s their sole source of income. It’s really tough,” said Witbooi. According to Witbooi, the pandemic has derailed the plans of their star fighter Sigqibo. They thought he would have been given a chance to fight for the WBO world title by last December and in 2021 focus on defending it and unifying the division. But It was not to be due to Covid 19. Gopher said: “The majority of boxers depend on it to put food on the table. The coronavirus outbreak destabilised everything. “There were no boxing tournaments both professional and amateur and that was sad for our sport,” he said.
