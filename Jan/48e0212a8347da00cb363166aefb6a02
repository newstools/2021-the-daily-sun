A manhunt for two suspects has been launched by Mpumalanga cops after they escaped from police custody. Cops described the two prisoners Sabelo Nkosi (24) and Njabulo Nsibande (27) as dangerous. The duo is said to have escaped in the Gert Sibande District near Ermelo Correctional Centre. They were being transported from Breyten Magistrates Court to the correctional facility. Nkosi and Nsibande were initially arrested after they reportedly committed various offences in December 2016.  “These offences include murder, attempted murder, two counts of rape as well as two counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, and were both on trial for the said charges. The escapees appeared before the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court, which was sitting at Breyten on Monday, 25 January 2021,” said police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi. He urged members of the public, including the families of the suspects, to assist with information that may lead to their rearrest. Anyone with information on their whereabouts is urged to contact Detective Sergeant Mmabatho Mafate on 072 610 5768 from Ermelo family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit or call the CrimeStop on 08600 10111. An internal investigation, looking into how these suspects escaped, is underway.
