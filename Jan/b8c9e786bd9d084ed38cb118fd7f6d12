THEIR sister had been missing for so long, her family was trying to get used to the idea that she was probably dead. But then a smart rubbish collector and SunPower stepped in! Rubbish collector Olga Mbalati (36) said she picked up the Daily Sun from the dumping site in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni and kept it safe. “It had the picture of a missing woman,” she said. “I don’t know if that is what made me keep the paper.” She said when she saw Amanda Gcasamba (31) she knew it was her. “I didn’t want to call the family so I decided to involve the police,” she said.  On New Year’s Eve Busiswa (45) got a surprise when her sister, who is autistic, walked into their yard in Emkhathini in Tembisa, accompanied by police. “Police asked if I knew her, and I said yes. My sister was so filthy. She had not bathed in months,’ said Busiswa. She said police told her they got a call from a woman who recognised her from a Daily Sun she had picked up from a dump site. Busiswa said she gave up hope of finding her sister alive after she disappeared last year in March before lockdown. A missing person’S CASE was opened at Rabasotho police station. Busiswa said her daughter fetched Amanda from school as it was not far from home. “When my daughter arrived home alone and when asked where my sister was, she said she wasn’t at school.” Buyiswa tried everything in her power to find her but with no luck. Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha confirmed a missing person’s case was opened at Rabasotho Police Station and said the family should come to the police station to close the case.
