THE PORT Elizabeth High Court has ordered Nelson Mandela Bay speaker, Buyelwa Mafaya, to call a council meeting within seven days to elect a mayor. This is despite the city’s coalition partners and Co-operative Governance MEC Xolile Nqatha stricking an out-of-court settlement. Nqatha wanted the court to nullify Nqaba Bhanga’s election as mayor. Bhanga was elected mayor at a chaotic special council meeting in December. During that meeting Mafaya was manhandled and forcibly taken out of the meeting, allegedly by men believed to be municipal bodyguards. Patriotic Alliance councillor, Marlon Daniels, was elected acting speaker in order to elect Bhanga as mayor. Mafaya adjourned the meeting while in hospital after the alleged kidnapping. On Tuesday, acting judge Denzil Potgieter ordered Mafaya to convene a council meeting within seven days of the court order, and that the council agenda include the election of a mayor. Potgieter also ordered Mafaya to deliver notice of the meeting to all councillors within 48 hours of the court order and make sure the mayor is elected. Bhanga’s acting spokesman, Councillor Morne Steyn, said: “The court order makes a provision for the current government to remain in office until a new mayor is elected. “We’re confident our coalition is stable and we’ll be able to re-elect the current mayor to continue with the progress we’ve been doing since we took over. “We decided to take the out-of-court settlement because we wanted to save ratepayers money and put citizens of this Metro first. We all came to the agreement to put this matter to bed and avoid lengthy legal processes,” he said.
