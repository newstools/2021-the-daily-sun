Metrorail in Cape Town’s set to resume train services on the central line after they were shut down at the end of 2019. The Metrorail regional manager Raymond Maseko and MEC of Transport in Western Cape Bonginkosi Madikizela visited the central line on Wednesday 27 JANUARY to check on the progress. Maseko said: “This line is going to be operational very soon. We have done a lot of infrastructure rehabilitation just to introduce the trains from Cape Town up to Langa. “I can commit that within the first two weeks of February, you will see a train here.” He said the technical team has been doing technical tests. He said the safety regulator still has to be satisfied that the line is ready to be reopened. Maseko, however, said the line that normally caters for commuters from kasis such as Nyanga, Khayelitsha and Philippi will only operate between Cape Town and Langa. Public Transport Voice spokesman Dalton Ndongeni said it is good that something is being done but it will not change much because people who live far from town are the ones who need trains the most. “People who stay in Khayelitsha who previously used trains are struggling because they are forking lots of money for transport, yet their salaries do not increase. “Metrorail must do something to ensure train services are restored in all these areas,” said Ndongeni. Masuku said the Pinelands line that goes from the Cape Flats to areas such as Athlone, Hazendal, Crawford and Ottery will also open in two weeks time. “Both these lines are going to come back in the second week of February,” said Maseko. Gladys Bepe (48) from Langa said the return of trains is good news. “We were forking out between R30 to 40 for transport every day. With trains, I used to buy a monthly ticket for R150 and it helped me to save money. I’m happy that trains are coming back,” she said. Madikizela said they have made R10 million available to assist Prasa with vegetation control along the railway lines.
