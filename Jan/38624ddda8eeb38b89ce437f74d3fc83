MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi has heaped praise on midfielder Mothobi Mvala, who has emerged as one of the key players for the Tshwane giants this season. The former Highlands Park captain might have found it difficult to break into the star-studded Downs team but when his chance eventually came, he grabbed it with both hands. He has now played six matches in all competition for the Brazilians, finding the back of the net on three occasions. The 26-year-old was largely expected to find it tough to get a look in at Sundowns when he joined from Highlands because of the quality the Tshwane giants have, especially in midfield. But his work ethic seems to have put him in the good books of the technical team, who have put a lot of trust in his abilities in recent matches. He was again called upon to protect the defence in the DStv Premiership Tshwane derby against SuperSport United which ended goalless. Mngqithi had nothing but praise for Mvala after the match. “Mothobi is a fighter,” said Mngqithi. “When you are going to war in a match against a rival such as SuperSport, Orlando Pirates or a Champions League fixture against a team like Jwaneng Galaxy, then you need someone like him. You have to add some strength. His aerial ability also comes in handy for the team. “He has been very good, scoring goals for the team and his game has improved. “His passing game has also improved a lot. He has forced himself into the team. His attitude and level of professionalism is very encouraging. He has quickly become one of the leaders in the team. “Those who are doing well, like Mothobi, need to continue playing until they break down somewhere because when you keep changing unnecessarily you end up killing the confidence of players.”
