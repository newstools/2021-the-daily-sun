JACKIE looked out the window, and there it was. . . a goat covered in traditional cloths and colours! It was dressed in multi-coloured ukuthwasa clothing! Jackie Mbanyele (39) from Sefene Village, in Botlokwa outside Polokwane, found the goat in his yard on Thursday last week. “It was dressed in the four different colours normally worn by amathwasa,” said Jackie. “The red and white were tied around its body, the black and white were lying on the veranda. PYTHON EATS PREGNANT DOG! “I was shocked and called my wife to witness what I saw. I used the back door so that the goat wouldn’t run away. “But when I approached the goat it didn’t run away. Instead it moved around the cloths on the ground and it was chewing something.” Jackie said he called his dad who lives in the same village, and who advised him to call the cops. The cops told them to let it go. “He said if we kill it we might have killed a human disguised as an animal. Community members surrounded my yard to see the goat in ukuthwasa clothes.” His dad said this may be a creature controlled by evil beings, couldn’t return to its masters, and was trapped. Before the goat was released in the presence of cops, Jackie splashed it with holy water.  “I opened the gate, but it jumped over the 1,5-metre fence and ran for about 100 metres. The community chased it and burned it.” Jim Mphelo (61) said he’s not used to this.” Ngaka Rarang Mogale from Thabaneng Village, in Ditatju outside Polokwane, told the People’s Paper: “It’s pure evil powers hidden under the goat and cloth. Jackie must protect his home. Otherwise the event will keep on happening.” Another independent healer said the killing of the goat activates a curse. Inspector Alfred Dlamini of the SPCA said: “This is cruelty to animals. In future they must call the SPCA. We’re here to educate.”
