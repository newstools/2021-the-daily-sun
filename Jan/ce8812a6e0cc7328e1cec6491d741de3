BAPTISM usually symbolises rebirth, but it turned ugly for a pastor and a congregant who drowned during a baptism ceremony in Moganwe Spruit in Atteridgville, Tshwane, on Sunday. According to police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo, the two men drowned during an apparent baptism ceremony. He said the members of the Tshwane water police rescue unit were called to the scene at about 2pm on Sunday after a man and a pastor had drowned. “It’s reported that the deceased were performing rituals when they drowned,” said Masondo. He said according to preliminary reports, a church member allegedly slipped during the ceremony and went underwater. “An inquest docket was opened by the Atteridgeville police,” he said. Their deaths got people talking on social media. Tshepo Matsetse said: “The results of not obeying level 3 rules.” Leonardo Zwane said: “The river snake doesn’t want to be interrupted, during mating. Vebi Nogwaza Gasela: said “Respect your government because it was put there by God. If you don’t follow the instructions from the government, you’re basically disrespectful to God.” Alfredo Sibanda: “No church activities are allowed during lockdown. So sad that emergency services had to deal with corona patients and stupid people.”
