IT doesn't rain but pours for Gavin Hunt at Kaizer Chiefs. On his first season with the club, the Amakhosi mentor has found the going tough with the club being ban by Caf from signing players for two transfer periods. That has resulted to dismal displays as they are in a embarrassing 14th spot in the DStv Premiership with seven points gathered from four draws and one win, while they lost the other four matches. As if that was not enough, the club have now announced that Zimbabwean international Khama Billiat will be out for two months after cracking a leg bone. "Khama Billiat has a cracked leg bone and will be out for 2 months. We wish him a speedy recovery," the club said in a brief statement. The club will also be without another striker, Leonardo Castro on Wednesday when they visit AmaZulu in a league match. Castro has an abdominal strain and there is no indication as to when he will be back on the pitch. However, the heartwarming news is that right back Reeve Frosler is back on the pitch running after a long spell on the side lines due to an injury. "Reeve Frosler is now running on the pitch. We will update you on his progress," the club stated.
