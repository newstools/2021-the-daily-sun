A FUNERAL parlour owner has begged people to follow Covid-19 regulations. Speaking to Daily Sun, Asaza Funeral Services founder Leonard Ncumbese said he’s had a staggering amount of claims this month. “I wanted to give up. It’s too much. There are so many claims and it will only be by God’s grace that I manage to continue,” he said. “It’s more than I can afford. Things have changed because of Covid-19. People are dying.” According to him, he rarely had 30 claims a month before Covid-19 started, but these had risen to more than 100 a week. “I was forced to cut my staff because I can’t keep them anymore. What am I going to give them if they continue working?” he said. Even coffin makers had run out of stock! “We’re getting calls from hospitals at about 2am to come and take the bodies,” he said. “When we tell them we’ll come in the morning we’re told there’s no space. If we all behave we can conquer it.” According to him, more rural people are dying because they think Covid-19 only infects the rich and educated. “I don’t know where they get that. This virus kills everyone,” said Ncumbese. Resident Masixole Ndzwana (45) said the country will soon reach a stage where people will just be thrown in a hole. “What happened in Italy will happen here. There are people who still think there’s no corona,” said Masixole. He didn’t blame funeral parlours for failing to pay everyone. “Where do we want them to get the coffins. Why can’t we do what’s expected of us as residents? Why is it so difficult for people to stay at home or wear a mask?”
