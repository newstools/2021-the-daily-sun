GOLD bars worth R61 million have been seized at OR Tambo International Airport. Three suspected smugglers are expected to appear before the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court on charges of dealing with precious metal and contravention of the Customs Act after gold, weighing 73,5kg, was found in their hand luggage at the airport. Police spokeswoman Colonel Athlenda Mathe said they acted on information provided by security officials at the airport after a scanner identified irregular images. “A team consisting of the SAPS, SARS, customs officials plus the departments of health and home affairs caught the trio. “They had flown in from Madagascar, and were going to Dubai via Ethiopia,” she said. Mathe said upon the questioning of the suspects and inspection of their hand luggage, officials discovered the gold bars and some foreign currency. “Both the bars and foreign currency have been seized for further investigation. The suspects have been detained and the matter has been taken over by the SAPS Organised Crime Unit for investigations.” Investigations by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, with the assistance of Interpol with authorities from various countries, were also underway to determine the legitimacy of the certification papers as provided by the trio and the country of origin where the gold was mined. “Investigations will also focus on which country the gold bars were heading for.”
