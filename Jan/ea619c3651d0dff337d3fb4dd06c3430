THE Sun City Resort has experienced a rapid increase in Covid-19 cases. This led to the North West EFF asking the health department to investigate the alleged disregard of Covid-19 regulations at the resort. Provincial EFF spokesman Jerry Matebesi said: “It has come to our attention that many employees continue to test positive for Covid-19, and the resort is not doing anything to remedy this. “We hereby call on the ANC government to prioritise the lives of our black people that continue to be on the forefront of the sacrificial line for profit.” A worker at Sun City said they feared for their lives. “Most of our colleagues are not reporting for work. Most of us are scared. It’s scary to be on the same shift as a colleague and later hear that they have tested positive,” said the employee. “Management never bothers to inform us or conduct contact tracing. We have lost two workers to this deadly virus. However, the resort never closed to sanitise. Cases increase every day, but it’s business as usual here.” Sun City general manager Brett Hoppé said since re-opening after the hard lockdown, cleaning processes had been intensified. “If a positive case is reported, the infected area is immediately sealed and sanitised. Between June and December, a total of 51 positive cases were reported. “There have been no fatalities as yet at the resort, but we have experienced two connected to the resort. One was a staff member and the other was employed by a cleaning company contracted to Sun City,” he said. “We have a track-and-trace team in place. This team works closely with the North West health department’s tracing officers at our local hospital.” Health department spokesman Tebogo Lekgetwane didn’t respond to e-mails, calls or WhatsApp messages.
