IPID is investigating a discharge of a firearm case after a video showing such an incident went viral. The video of the incident – which occurred on Monday, 25 January in Milnerton, Cape Town – shows Metro cops shooting at a car. Ipid spokeswoman Ndileka Cola said it appeared they were chasing a stolen car that had collided with theirs. “The cops allegedly fired shots at the tyres of the vehicle, which sped off into a basement parking area. The suspect was arrested,” said Cola. The city’s executive director for safety and security, Richard Bosman, said the driver went through a red light. When cops tried to stop him he drove into their vehicle, causing damage. “He sped off. “When officers caught up with him and instructed him to exit his car, he refused. “They then shot at his tyres.” He said cops undergo training for such situations, and the video showed they shot at the tyres to limit attempts to flee. Failure to do that could have resulted in injury or death of innocent bystanders. The City’s Metro police spokeswoman, Ruth Solomons said rumours that the officers searched the house of the driver and found drugs, is fake.
