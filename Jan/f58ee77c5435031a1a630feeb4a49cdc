THE Mhala Magistrates Court has issued a warrant of arrest against a teacher after he pulled a no-show on Friday 29 January. The 56-year-old teacher was bust in August last year at his home in Clare Village in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. This came after he allegedly stole 43 sheets of zinc valued at R35000 meant for developing a new shopping mall. The mall’s being built by businesswoman Pretty Baloyi in the nearby Ludlow Village. His lawyer Advocate Makhosonke Mashego told the court he had just been informed the teacher was sick and couldn’t come to court. “Your worship, I got a report from his wife who is present before court that my client is not feeling well. He became sick on Wednesday,” said Mashego. Magistrate Robert Mokone said: “A warrant of arrest has been authorised and handed over against the accused.” The teacher was out on R1000 bail. Magistrate Mokone postponed the matter until 12 February.
