IN A YouTube video, North West Premier Job Mokgoro has spoken about his recovery from Covid-19. He told the public it is important to stick to regulations. Explaining how he got to take the test, Mokgoro said after having mild flu for two weeks, he went to see a doctor, who referred him for Covid-19 tests in July last year. When the result was positive, he was then hospitalised. “The hospital wrapped my whole body in plastic,” he said. “Having to be wrapped like a lifeless person was really shocking.” He said the work pressure nurses were feeling was concerning. “But they had a positive attitude and took care of me very well,” he said. “I did a lot of self-reflection in hospital. “I realised that as a leader having gone through this experience, I got a better understanding of what we are dealing with.” Mokgoro spoke about the importance of people to get educated about Covid-19. “If people understood how the virus worked, they will be in a better position to understand that it is inappropriate to stigmatise those who have tested positive,” he said. “Wearing a mask reduces the spread of infectious droplets, especially when someone speaks, coughs or sneezes. “Social distancing is crucial for preventing the spread. Let us wash our hands at all times and sanitise. We should continue adhering to the regulations.”
