KASI businesswoman Ntomboxolo “Ntosh” Nonxuba keeps her hair natural to inspire young black women. “We need to teach our kids that their hair is enough and that they are enough, and don’t need anything foreign on their bodies,” she said. Ntosh said women have preferences regarding their hair, but they needed to look beyond their looks. “Why do we have kids who grow up with low self-esteem? It is because mothers have shown the child that when she sleeps at night she is one person and the next day she is somebody else,” she said. “When a mother shows her child that she doesn’t like her hair, then the child will dislike her own hair.” She said her own five-year-old daughter refused braids after her aunt wanted to take her to a saloon. “Some people wear other people’s hair. I don’t know how we got to that, but that doesn’t work for me. Ntosh was recently awarded the Entrepreneur of the Year in the Western Cape. “When a girl sees me, she can see that I’m black and I don’t have long hair, yet I drive a nice car and I own a business,” she said. “If you start making money and change your looks, it means you’re discriminating against yourself.” She said it was a bold statement that both former Miss South Africa Zozi Tunzi and current Miss SA, Shudufhadzo Musida have short hair. “Stop wasting your money by buying other people’s hair,” said Ntosh.
