THE Mpumalanga Education Department has increased the number of marking centres to 19 to ensure social distancing and to accommodate the increased number of papers. Mpumalanga Education MEC Bonakele Majuba told Daily Sun he appreciates the work of staff members who will be involved in the task and urged everyone to exercise extra care and adhere to the Covid-19 health and safety regulations. He said all marking officials will be expected to follow Covid-19 precautionary protocols all the time by wearing masks, sanitising and washing their hands and maintaining social distancing. He said so far all systems are in place to ensure a smooth marking process which was scheduled to commence on Monday and finish on 22 January. “The marking personnel have been trained with the exception of some markers who will receive orientation for two days when they arrive at marking centres,” he said. “As we are to embark on this important task, all measures to secure the integrity of the examination must be adhered to. It is also very important to observe the Covid-19 protocol at all times,” he said. “Everyone will be fully screened upon arrival at marking centres which is expected to be daily routine until the last day of marking.” He wished everyone the best and said they guaranteed the full support of the department to ensure the safety of every member of the marking personnel and upholding the integrity of the examinations.
