MAMELODI Sundowns are looking at maintaining their unbeaten run in the 202-21 DStv Premiership. On Tuesday evening Sundowns host Bloemfontein Celtic in a league match at Lucas Moripe Stadium (5pm). Sundowns will be looking to maintain their number one spot at the top of the table. The DStv Premiership reigning champions are one of three teams who are yet to taste a defeat since the beginning of the season. They have accumulated a tally of 25 points from 11 matches. “It is refreshing to know that we are going into this game without having lost a match, it allows us to go out and get more wins and we want to continue with the good run that we are having,” Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana said. The last time Sundowns lost a match was against Siwelele in the MTN8 quarter-finals last year. Kekana is aware that playing against coach John Maduka’s side will not be a walk in a park, but they are well prepared for the clash. He said: “Playing against Celtic is not going to be easy or smooth as they play an awkward system. “The boys have worked hard in the past two days in preparations for the game. We are playing at home and the objective is simple and that is to win and get the three points that the team requires. He concluded: “The team looks ready and refreshed and we are looking forward to the match and hopefully, we get the win and continue being unbeaten.” Celtic are coming to this encounter having not won in their last six matches of all competitions. They are occupying the 11th spot on the Premiership standings with just 10 points from 11 matches. A win for them will go a long as it could take them into the top eight.
