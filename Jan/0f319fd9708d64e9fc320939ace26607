A man who was arrested for dealing in drugs has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Wiseman Shongwe (31) appeared before the Secunda Regional Court in Mpumalanga on Thursday 28 January. According to Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, in August 2016 nine drug syndicate members were arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation unit in Secunda during a project driven investigation. The “Project 24” Operation was targeting the manufacturing and dealing in drugs around Secunda. “The eight other suspects admitted guilt on the open trial and were sentenced in 2018 to a total of 144 years combined imprisonment,” she said. Sekgotodi said Shongwe, however, opted to go for trial and appeared several times in the same court while he remained in custody since his arrest in 2016. “He was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 15 years direct imprisonment on each of the three counts of dealing in drugs. The first two of the three sentences are said to run concurrently and the judge ordered that the accused serve an effective minimum of 20 years direct imprisonment,” said Sekgotodi. The provincial head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Major General Zodwa Mokoena welcomed the sentence and applauded the team for the great work. “I hope this will serve as deterrent to those who are still committing such crimes,” said Mokoena.
