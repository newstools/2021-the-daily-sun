FORMER Uzalo actor Kay Sibiya has joined Generations: The Legacy. He’ll be playing the role of Siyanda, Jack Mabaso’s younger brother. According to an insider, he didn’t get a free pass to join the show and underwent a vigorous audition process. “There were three guys vying for this role and, after a long audition process, he emerged victorious. Producers were happy with his consistency,” said the source. The show’s casting director, Russel Savadier, said Kay was the first name that came to mind when the role was written.

He was still trying to wrap his mind around it. “I’m excited and nervous at the same time. I grew up with the show and now being part of the family is out of this world. It’s surreal,” he said. Kay said he looks forward to playing a new character that will challenge him and show his versatility as an actor. “It’s going to be an amazing experience, one I look forward to exploring,” he said. Kay, who hits the small screen this week, made his name playing the role of a pastor on Uzalo. He later appeared on Mzansi Magic’s The Queen.
