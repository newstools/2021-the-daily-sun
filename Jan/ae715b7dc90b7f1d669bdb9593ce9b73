A FAMILY in Dlamini, Soweto is fearing for their lives. This after gunmen attacked them on Saturday, 16 January, killing seven-year-old Bongani Korasi. Mum Irene (37) told Daily Sun she was at work when the attack took place. She said she didn’t know why the men attacked them. A relative who was in the shack during the attack, said the men attacked them at about 2.30am. Another relative who’s fighting for his life in hospital, tried to stop the men from entering the shack, but they were too strong for him.  “My relative then took a golf stick and beat one of the men.” She said the men fired two shots while she hit one of them with a steel rod. “He tried to shoot me, but missed. The men never said what they were looking for. They just came in and started beating us up. “They fired several shots from outside as they were leaving, which hit my little brother and injured others.” The relative said that this wasn’t the first time, as they were also attacked in October. The family feared the men would come back. Gauteng SAPS spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said police have launched a search for unknown suspects while investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting. “A case of murder and attempted murder is being investigated. The motive is yet to be determined,” said Peters. Police appeal to anyone in the community with information about the suspects to report to Moroka SAPS or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
