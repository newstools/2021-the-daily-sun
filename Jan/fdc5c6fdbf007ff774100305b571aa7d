On Friday 29 January, cops foiled an attempt by a group of suspects who were planning to commit a crime in Lombardy East near Alexandra in Joburg. According to Captain Mavela Masondo, initial evidence suggested the suspects were in the middle of plotting to commit an aggravated crime before they were disturbed by the police. “We recovered two AK-47 rifles with loaded magazines, an R-1 rifle with two loaded magazines, and two loaded pistols at a house in Lombardy East. “Inside the yard were 10 vehicles and an eleventh vehicle outside. These cars are suspected to be used as getaway cars during the commission of a crime,” Masondo said. He said cops were patrolling the area when they observed a suspicious white Toyota Quest with three occupants.  “The members then noticed a firearm on one of the occupants,” he said. Masondo said cops then approached the car and searched the man. “An unconfirmed number of armed men are reported to have emerged from a nearby house and a shoot-out between the police and the suspects ensued,” he said. Masondo said a manhunt was launched after they arrested one suspect while others fled on foot and others in two vehicles. The provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela hailed the cops who were vigilant during their patrol. “This is an indication that police in the province are on high alert to protect the properties and lives of the citizens,” said Mawela.
