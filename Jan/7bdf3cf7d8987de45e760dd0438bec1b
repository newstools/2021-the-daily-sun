PATRICE Motsepe has overcome the final hurdle in his bid for Caf presidency. Motsepe is among the four candidates, including Ahmed Yahya of Mauritania, Augustin Senghor, the president of the Senegal FA, and Ivory Coast FA president Jacques Anouma, who have been declared eligible to contest the positions of Caf president and Fifa vice-president by the Fifa Review Committee, Fifa has said in a letter addressed to the Mamelodi Sundowns supremo. “We refer to our correspondence dated 12 January 2021 regarding the subject matter. In this regard, we kindly inform you that the Review Committee has declared you eligible for the position of Caf President and Fifa vice-president,” read the Fifa letter. Together with Yahya, Motsepe's eligibility had been subject to further checks by the Caf Governance Committee. “Their candidatures were deemed admissible. However, the committee considered that further checks are necessary before a final decision. "To this end, a hearing of these candidates will be organised in Cairo on 28 January 2021,” read the Caf statement regarding the candidature of Motsepe and Yahya. The other two candidates, Augustin Senghor, the president of the Senegal FA, and Ivory Coast FA president Jacques Anouma, faced no further eligibility checks. But the correspondence from Fifa paves the way for the South African businessman to run for Caf presidency. Safa, who nominated Motsepe for the position, also confirmed the latest developments. Motsepe has been on a campaign trail, traversing the continent in an effort to garner support. The election will take place in Rabat, Morocco, on 12March.
