SIX shacks and two houses burnt to ashes in Delft, leaving 17 people homeless. The fire in the Cape Town kasi erupted on Thursday morning 28 January. Speaking to Daily Sun, Bianca Daniels (19) said they couldn’t save anything from the fire. “We lost everything, including our dog. We couldn’t take anything out. The dog burnt inside our house,” said Bianca. According to her, the fire started in a Wendy house next door. “We are still shocked. We have no idea what happened and we have so many questions on what caused the fire,” she said. “Our neighbour doesn’t know what happened but the fire started there and affected our home. It was so strong. You could swear it was sent to destroy our things.” Bianca said she was worried because they live with two family members who are pregnant. “My sister and my sister-in-law are both pregnant and one of them is nine-months pregnant and can give birth any time. But there are no clothes for the baby. They all got burnt inside the house,” she said. She pleaded with SunReaders to assist them with anything as they’re only left with what they’re wearing. One of her neighbours said they tried to assist them but they failed to save their belongings. “It is so sad to lose everything all at once like this,” said the resident. The city’s Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said they received an emergency call at 10.38am to a Wendy’s house that was alight in Verdi Crescent. “Fire crews from Mitchells Plain and Belhar were on scene. He said the fire was contained and extinguished at 11.47am. “A total of two formal dwellings and six informal structures were destroyed leaving, 17 persons displaced. No injuries were reported,” said Carelse.
