AN unknown person at the Ditsobotla Municipality chambers in North West broke up the council meeting with pepper spray yesterday, where reinstatement of axed mayor Daniel Buthelezi was to be discussed. Minutes after the meeting started, a man, who many said was unfamiliar, sprayed the room with pepper spray without a word. Councillors had to leave the chambers and the speaker adjourned the meeting. Last week, North West High Court ordered for Buthelezi to be reinstated immediately after he was voted out in a motion of no confidence at a council sitting in December. “We did not get a chance to continue with the meeting as it was interrupted by people who sprayed us with pepper spray,” said EFF councillor Themba Sonakile. He said the interruption may have come from people in support of Buthelezi. “ANC members are divided. There are those who want Buthelezi and those who want Patrick Moreo.” Municipal spokesman Pius Batsile said: “An unknown person used pepper spray during a council meeting, which forced the speaker to adjourn the sitting.”
