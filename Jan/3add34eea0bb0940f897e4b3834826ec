IT has been reliably learnt by SunSport that former Bidvest Wits defender, Buhle Mkhwanazi, is taking Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) to court. It is alleged Mkhwanazi is not getting paid by the club while he still has an existing contract ever since Wits sold their DStv Premiership status to TTM boss Masala Mulaudzi during the off season. However, he’s fed up and has since hauled the club to court hoping to get his dues paid before the end of the week. “Mkhwanazi is taking the club to court. He was hoping a settlement might be struck by the end of this week,” said our insider. Neither Mkhwanazi nor his agent Paul Mitchell were available for comment. But TTM official Livhuwani Madzuhe said he cannot comment because it’s a sensitive matter. “The matter is between the management and the player,” said Madzuhe. The stumbling block appears to be the fact Mkhwanazi was one of the highest earners at Wits and the club can’t afford his salary. This is why TTM couldn’t keep coach Gavin Hunt (Kaizer Chiefs), Sifiso Hlanti and Kgaogelo Sekgota (now both at Swallows), Thabang Monare, Deon Hotto, Terrence Dzvukamanja (all at Orlando Pirates), because these players were said to be high earners at Wits last year. Ever since TTM bought Wits’ status, controversy has plagued them. There were reports that players would not show up for the match against Kaizer Chiefs on Tuesday, as they were alleged to be on the verge of going on strike over unpaid salaries. The Soweto giants beat them 3-0. SunSport reported a few weeks ago that TTM players weren’t paid their December salaries and the players were set to boycott the club’s first match of 2021 against Stellenbosch FC. TTM lie second bottom with nine points from 12 games. They have not won in the last eight games, losing the last three where they have failed to score.
