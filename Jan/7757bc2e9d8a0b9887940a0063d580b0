THEIR discomfort started following videos of a struggling soldier named Mabena. The videos went viral on social media two years ago, resulting in anyone considered “stupid” being called Mabena. Just when the clan thought that had died down, the SABC aired ads encouraging the public to always wear a mask and quit acting like Mabenas. It seems this was the final straw for the Mabena clan, who demonstrated outside the SABC yesterday. They wanted the public broadcaster to immediately stop airing the ads. Carrying placards, they chanted that the surname should be respected. One placard read: “Change the stereotype. I am Mabena! Stop the insult.” Another read: “Direct discrimination to us and our kingdom. Such behaviour will not be tolerated.” Mandla Mabena Kamakerana told Daily Sun the mockery of their surname was degrading. “The advert perpetuates a wrong narrative and stereotype. We’re not mamparas because of our surname. “We decided to stand up and say enough is enough. “We can’t allow this to continue because it will affect our children. They’ll be teased and mocked in schools because of their surname.” Prince Nkosana Mabena said they wanted the ads to be pulled, an apology, as well as compensation. “This is an insult to our kingdom and our king,” he said. Ngqabutho Mabena said: “We wouldn’t have agreed even if it was another African surname. “The ad is insulting and derogatory. The SABC should portray pan Africanism and educate the African child to be proud. Children will think being Mabena isn’t a great thing.” Solidarity Fund behavioural change pillar executive head, Wendy Tlou, said: “Both parties have agreed to a face-to-face socially distanced meeting on Monday, 11th January. “We had a respectful, open and honest conversation with the prince, Nkosana Mabena, and assured him there was no ill-intent. “The campaign urges citizens not to behave like a mampara, ibhari, a Mabena, moemish as well as a moegoe.”
