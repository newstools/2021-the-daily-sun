The DStv Premiership’s weekend action saw a first defeat of the season for Golden Arrows, while Mamelodi Sundowns, SuperSport United and Swallows FC are in a three-way tie at the top of the log. Saturday’s top-of-the-table clash between Mamelodi Sundowns and Swallows FC ended in a dramatic 1-1 draw. The Brazilians looked set to end the Birds’ unbeaten run thanks to Kermit Erasmus’ goal late in the first half, but an equaliser from Musa Nyatama deep in injury time at the end of the game kept the teams level on 27 points at the top of the table. On Sunday, they were joined by SuperSport United, who slipped in between first-placed Downs and third-placed Swallows thanks to a 2-0 away win over basement-dwellers Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila – with goals from Bradley Grobler and Sipho Mbule. Sunday’s other game witnessed a first loss for Golden Arrows, who were out-gunned 4-2 by hosts Cape Town City. Goals from Craig Martin, Taariq Fielies, Mduduzi Mdantsane and Fagrie Lakay saw the Citizens push into fourth, five points off the pace set by the leading trio. The weekend also saw Kaizer Chiefs’ winning run come to an end, as they were held 0-0 at a plucky Stellenbosch FC, while Orlando Pirates claimed a 1-0 victory at Maritzburg United courtesy of a strike from Deon Hotto. AmaZulu picked up a first away win of the season, defeating Baroka FC 2-0 thanks to strikes from Bonginkosi Ntuli and Siphelele Magubane, while Chippa United continued their revival with an emphatic 3-0 triumph at Black Leopards – Andile Mbenyane, Mokhele Maloisane and Kurt Lentjies netted for the Chilli Boys. The DStv Premiership will continue with four midweek matches on 26-27 January, with South Africa’s four Caf club representatives this season all in action: Orlando Pirates, Bloemfontein Celtic, Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs.
