PASTOR Boy Mkhomolo has been sentenced to 18 years behind bars for raping an 11-year-old relative. The 62-year-old from Allandale Village, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, pleaded guilty before Magistrate Elmarie Theron in the Mhala Regional Court on Tuesday, 19 January. The court heard the crime was committed in 2018 after the pastor left home with the victim. He threatened her with a panga before raping her. The victim later told teachers at the school about the incident and was taken to a clinic. Nurses confirmed she had been raped and the pastor was arrested. The two were allegedly bust pumping diesel at Clenco Mini in Ogies. Provincial Hawks spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi said the two were arrested last week after they were allegedly caught red-handed stealing diesel. “It is alleged that an employee of Clenco Mine colluded with a diesel truck driver to steal the diesel from the pipelines. “He used the tag of one of the mine tankers parked at a workshop,” she said. “A probe by the Hawks team revealed that the owner of the truck is a person of interest in another diesel theft case. “When the arrest happened, 11 425 litres of diesel worth R142 000 had already been pumped into the tanker.”
