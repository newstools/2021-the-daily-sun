COMMUNITY leader Nontuthuzelo Arosi (51), who died two weeks ago, was buried at Welmoed Cemetery in Kuilsriver in the morning on Sunday, 3 January. Philippi residents were shocked when Nontuthuzelo died in Cala, Eastern Cape, following a visit to her family. Earlier on Sunday, a group of women dressed in ANC Women’s League uniforms took to the streets, singing and dancing, ahead of her burial. The family had a short service at Ruth First Hall, where few people were allowed due to Covid-19 regulations. Daughter Neliswa Arosi (34) was devastated after losing her mum, who was only sick for one day.  “I still can’t believe she’s no more, and the reality is sinking in today because we’re burying her. She was everything to me and my life will never be the same again,” she said. Arosi in the past served in the local Sanco branch as deputy chairwoman. She also served as deputy SACP branch chairwoman. At the time of her death, she was ANCWL branch secretary in ward 80. ANC chairman, Nkululeko Mgolobane, said: “She was a committed leader who served her kasi with distinction and will be missed. She left a gap that can’t be replaced.” Resident Lungile Siwa (53) said Nontuthuzelo was a go-to leader when they had problems ekasi. “Things will never the same without this leader. She’d do everything to ensure things went the right way. She was driven by wanting wellbeing for her people,” said Lungile.
