I’m distressed by the immigration situation at Beitbridge Border post in the Limpopo River in Limpopo Province. Foreigners continue to cross the full and treacherous crocodile-infested Limpopo River along the borderline between Zimbabwe and South Africa. This is despite an incident in which three people are said to have drowned recently. Now that the river is full, some foreigners have come up with plans to continue crossing and putting their lives in danger. The river is very dangerous, but these people don’t care. The Zimbabwean government needs to intervene and tell the Zimbabweans to stop risking their lives. I know it’s tough back home because people are struggling, but this is not how you do it. The Zimbabwean government must step up and make things better for the citizens of that country. Letter  by Norman Maake Tembisa
