AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy wants to add more pressure onto Kaizer Chiefs at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium when they meet in their DStv PSL clash tomorrow (3pm). Chiefs are going through a rough patch this season. They lost 2-0 at home to Maritzburg United at the weekend and can expect no sympathy from McCarthy’s Usuthu. Amakhosi are in 14th position with only seven points from nine fixtures, and are dangerously close to the relegation zone. But McCarthy is more worried about his side dropping two points in their 1-1 draw against Bloemfontein Celtic on Sunday, as he felt they should have won the game. McCarthy took some positives and one of them was his side’s fight back after Celtic had taken the lead. The former Cape Town City coach was also impressed with the team’s intensity and the way they went about their business. He has demanded a repeat of that against struggling Chiefs.v“Yes, we dropped points but now we focus on the midweek game against Chiefs,” said McCarthy. “Against Chiefs, we’ll try and do exactly the same as we did against Celtic, but we have to work hard and put the ball in the back of the net.” McCarthy was without six of his players against Celtic due to Covid-19 and also injury issues. Siphiwe Tshabalala, Makhehleni Makhaula and Sibusiso Mabiliso all returned positive Covid-19 tests. Bongi Ntuli was absent as McCarthy was cautious not to throw him back in because he has been out for a long time with a foot injury. Siphesihle Maduna, a fine youngster who was nominated for Young Player of the Season last term, got injured in training with a recurring foot injury. Siphelele Mthembu strained his hamstring and it is not clear whether he’ll be fit for face Amakhosi. This also leaves a question mark on whether Tshabalala will be fit to face his former club.
