THE Ndesana family from Langa in Cape Town wants justice for their daughter. Sibonokuhle (19), who was last seen on 25 December, was allegedly killed by her boyfriend. Her aunt, Pakama Ndesana (37) said: “We last saw her on 25 December when she was visiting her friends in Philippi’s Browns Farm. We were shocked when we got the news that she is no more.” From what they heard from friends, Sibonikuhle had apparently fought with her boyfriend. According to her, the boyfriend’s mother told them she heard the couple fighting but when she asked them to open the door, the boyfriend told her they are fine. “The suspect’s mother told us she kicked the door down to gain entry, and that’s when she found her body.” She said they lost an angel who wanted to change her family’s situation. “She finished her matric last year but couldn’t further her studies because her mother had lost her job. But she wanted to go back to school so that she can take care of her mother,” said Pakama. She said when they visited the mortuary to identify Sibonokuhle’s body, there was blood coming out of her nose. “We don’t know what to think because she didn’t have any stab wounds. It’s clear he hit her against something because she had a cut in the back of her head,” she said. Resident Olwethu Mlungwana (43) said there is something wrong in the area. “Young girls have been losing their lives in Browns Farm. “In fact, they are being killed by their boyfriends,” said Mlungwana. Colonel Andre Traut said the murder of a 19-year-old woman is under investigation following an incident in Nyanga. “A suspect was arrested the next day however due to a lack of evidence, he was not brought before the court. Once more evidence has been gathered, an arrest could be made,” said Traut.
