SWALLOWS FC DStv Diski Challenge coach Simon Tshowa says they are satisfied with the youngsters’ performance since the start of the season. The Diski Challenge kicked off first week of December and the teams went into Christmas recess having played three matches each. In those games, Swallows, who are new in the Diski Challenge, managed to collect six points with two wins and one defeat. Tshowa said it might be too early but for a team that started training four days before playing their first match, he’s quite pleased with his charges. He said: “Swallow is a new baby but with the three games, it gave us a glimpse. We can see where we are going. I’m pleased with the way these youngsters took this challenge and showed their hungry spirit. So, I believe there’s more to come from them. “We have 17- and 18-year-olds in this team.” Having not had enough time to prepare for the 2020-21 campaign, Tshowa said the first five games will be more like pre-season training and they are still studying their opponents in the league. In their last match, Swallows suffered a 2-0 defeat against Black Leopards. This was after a promising start where they registered maximum points beating Baroka FC 3-1 and TS Galaxy 2-0 respectively. Tshowa said: The defeat we suffered in our last game was more like a wake-up call. As you can see, we’re dealing with young players (17- and 18-year-olds), who easily get carried away. “We needed that defeat for them to not relax and think they’re better than other teams.” The Dube Birds will host new kids on the block Tsakhuma Tsa Madzivhandila (TTM) at the Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday (10am). Tshowa is also aware of the danger posed by TTM as they are still in search of their first win of the season. “It’ll be a tricky encounter but we’ll have to fight and get maximum points as we’re not looking to finish the season below position eight,” said the coach.
