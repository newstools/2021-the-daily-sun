A SHOOTING incident at the solid waste depot leaves one
employee dead. The City’s Divisional Head for Waste Management Services
Mandisa Phosa said this incident took place earlier this morning. “One of the
city’s male official was shot dead by unknown people, at the entrance gate,
while on duty,” said Phosa. Phosa told Daily Sun that workers are deeply affected by
this incident and they weren’t able to execute waste removal services today. “The government pathology team took long to collect the body of the deceased. Seeing the body lying on the ground at the entrance of the facility had a bad
psychological impact on our employees,” she said. “The city has arranged psychological therapy for the workers
to cope with the situation, “ said Phosa. She also assured workers that the city of Ekurhuleni is working with law enforcement
agencies to investigate this matter and they won’t rest till the perpetrators
are behind bars. She said this has affected the waste removal services in
Springs and Kwa-Thema. “Therefore, we are pleading with residents of Springs,
Kwa-Thema and surrounding areas to take out their 240L wheelie bins on
Wednesday morning by 7:00,” said Phosa. The city of Ekurhuleni has also sent heartfelt condolences
to the family of the deceased, colleagues and friends.
