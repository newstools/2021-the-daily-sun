HE was a loving stepfather who treated his girlfriend’s son as his own. But this didn’t stop the biological father from hacking him with a garden spade and killing him instantly on New Year’s Eve. Residents from Snake Park in Nigel grabbed the father to revenge the stepdad’s death and beat him with anything they could lay their hands on until he was unconscious. When cops arrived, the angry residents threatened to attack them but the man was rescued. He is fighting for his life in hospital and he is under police guard. The mother of the boy said her boyfriend, Sipho Ncongwane (44), came on New Year’s Eve to wish them a happy new year. “Because he was bit drunk, he decided to go and sleep at his own place,” she said. I POKE AND THEY FAINT! She said as he was leaving, her son followed him and a few minutes later the stepdad came back to ask for permission so her son could sleep at his place. But as they planned to leave, the biological father saw them and started threatening the stepdad. Sipho was attacked from behind by the father with a garden spade. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said the victim was hacked several times in the upper body until he died. “The 38-year-old suspect was apprehended and assaulted by a mob until he became unconscious.” Ramphora said the dead man was taken to Heidelberg government mortuary and the suspect is under police guard at the hospital. A murder case was opened at Nigel Police Station.
