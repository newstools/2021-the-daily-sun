AFTER the successful first season of Family Feud South Africa, season 2 entries are open. Hosted by American celebrity and funny man Steve Harvey, the wildly popular reality series is looking for families of five to enter before 17 January for a chance to compete on the show. Broadcasting exclusively on e.tv, the 26-episode series broadcasts to millions of South Africans each week! Harvey has been hosting the American version of Family Feud with enormous success since 2010.

Virginia Hollis, the co-founder G2 Connection, the company handling all brand immersion for the show, said this season is promising to be better than ever. “We’re anticipating a bigger season and an even bigger following in 2021,” said Hollis. “With KFC as headline sponsor and many opportunities for other brands to get on board, Family Feud South Africa is promising to maintain its number one slot in that 6pm time bracket. Steve Harvey’s introduction to South Africa’s many cultures and idiosyncrasies last year resulted in some hilarious on-set moments and we’re expecting more of the same this year as Mr Harvey gets to know South Africa and it’s incredible people even better,” she said.
