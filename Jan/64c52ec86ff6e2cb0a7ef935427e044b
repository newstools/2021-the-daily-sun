FORMER Black Leopards coach Dylan Kerr has spoken out following his departure from the Limpopo outfit. Kerr’s departure was announced by Lidoda Duvha on Monday, ending a short second spell at the club. Kerr has hinted at what could have led to his departure, saying he felt ‘betrayed’ but promised that he would ‘rise again.’ "I’m not big on religion but I do pray every day before training with my players and today I feel exactly like Jesus did..... Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus' twelve apostles, betrayed his master to the authorities. This act led to the crucifixion and death of Jesus. I will also rise,” Kerr wrote on social media. Although Kerr did not reveal who might have betrayed him, SunSport has learnt the reason the Englishman left Lidoda Duvha is that he didn’t have a good working relationship with his assistant coach Lehlohonolo Seema. Seema was appointed to assist Kerr alongside Morgan Shivambu last month .A source told SunSport that the two coaches nearly went physical in the dressing room after an argument following their 3-0 Premiership defeat to Chippa United at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. “Kerr was never happy when the club appointed Seema as his assistant, as he was happy to work with Morgan Shivambu and Mongezi Bobe instead,” said our source. “Their strained relationship escalated on Saturday after the defeat to Chippa. The two coaches had a serious argument and they had to be separated by team officials in the dressing room. “Even at training they never got along. After the heated argument, Kerr felt it will be best for him and the club to part ways.” Our mole said Kerr accused Seema of giving him wrong information about Chippa, a club that the Lesotho-born mentor used to coach before moving to Thohoyandou.
