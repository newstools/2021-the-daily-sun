THE South African Football Association (SAFA) have issued an apology to the Premier Soccer League (PSL) for their inability to provide eight teams to participate in this season’s Nedbank Cup as per norm. This is due to the recent suspension of all amateur football by Safa as a result of the rise in Covid-19 cases in the country. As a result, the PSL were left short with eight teams for Thursday night’s last 32 draw. The league has decided that the best way forward is to reinstall the eight GladAfrica Championship knocked out in the qualification competition to the Ke Yona Cup. The last 32 draw will now include the 16 DStv Premiership teams and 16 Glad Africa championship teams. “SAFA has wished the PSL “good luck” for the competition," read a statement from the PSL. “The PSL has discussed the matter with Nedbank and agreed that the only appropriate way to deal with the matter is to restore the eight GladAfrica championship teams recently knocked out in the qualification competition to the Nedbank Cup. “The 2020/21 Nedbank Cup will consequently proceed with 32 teams, being 16 DStv Premiership teams and 16 Glad Africa championship teams. “All of these participating teams will be a part of this evening’s draw.”
