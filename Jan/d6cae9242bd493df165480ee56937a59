Singer, songwriter and record producer Desmond “Dezz Muso” Jiyane (36) wants to leave a life-long legacy. Despite his late entry into the industry, the artist from Emalahleni in Mpumalanga has wasted no time in getting his music recognised. Dezz Muso recently released a single titled Sebenza, featuring DJ One Mile. “The song was created with the purpose of motivating people. It speaks about going out there and working hard for yourself and your family to achieve all that you desire. “The record is an upbeat house track with a beautiful combination of instruments, which will undoubtedly get you moving and in the right mood.” ALSO READ:LASIZWE: LIFE HAS BEEN ROUGH!
