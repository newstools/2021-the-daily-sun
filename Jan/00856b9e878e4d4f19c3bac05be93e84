It was the late American songstress Aliyah who said age is nothing but a number. The context then was that love has no age, but this notion seems to also apply to sex. A lot is often said about age and sex. Some would say that the younger it is, the longer it strokes or the older it is, the more experience entails. Either way, according to sexologists. There are age groups that are more sexual than others and according to recent research: People between the ages of 31-45 have the most sex. According to experts, men continue to have a strong sex drive through these years, though testosterone starts to slowly decrease around age 35. With women, this time of life may be when her sex drive is strongest. One study showed that women between 27 and 45 had more frequent and more intense sexual fantasies than younger or older women. So, it seems sex much like wine ages beautifully over time.
