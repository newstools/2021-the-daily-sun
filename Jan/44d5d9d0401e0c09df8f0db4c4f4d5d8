PEACE doesn’t seem to be the word that will soon be associated with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). SunSport has learnt that TTM have only 15 players in their camp ahead of today's match against Stellenbosch FC at Danie Craven Stadium (5pm). The reason is that the club did not pay some players their December salaries when the season went for a short break. On top of that, the club is said to have yet to receive the Covid-19 tests from these 15 players in camp. “TTM only have 15 players in the camp. The others are not in the team because they weren’t paid their December salaries,” said an insider. “Also the club has yet to receive the Covid-19 tests. They may be a situation where TTM may have 10 players for today’s game.” However, the club coach Joel Masutha has denied this. “You’ll see our team sheet with 20 players. Everything is in order,” said Masutha. “The rules are clear; you have to submit your Covid-19 test 24 hours before you play the match. The PSL has received them and everything is in order. We have 20 players and what you are asking me there’s no such thing.” TTM, who bought the DStv Premiership status of Bidvest Wits at the end of last season, have been embroiled in plenty of shenanigans on and off the field.
