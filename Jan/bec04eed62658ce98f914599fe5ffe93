JACOB Zuma’s ex-fiancee, Nonkanyiso Conco, wants everyone to know who she really is. That’s why she’s joined   The Real Housewives of Durban, which is about to hit the the small screen. The new reality show – also featuring Ayanda Ncwane, Kgomotso Ndungane, Sorisha Naaido, Nonku Williams and Anne-Tonni Lodick – starts on I Magic on 29 January. Nonkanyiso, a businesswoman, said viewers would officially get to meet LaConco, which is what her friends call her. “The media has created its own image of who Nonkanyiso Conco is, and this show will afford viewers the opportunity to experience her,” she said. “A true African gem who strongly believes in her culture and tradition. “A reminder to all women that a woman, with her mind set on things, will always be a step closer to succeeding, no matter the circumstances or climate around her.” LaConco advised viewers to get to know the format of the show to better enjoy it. “Real Housewives brings a new perspective and definition to what a housewife is in the modern day,” she said. “The show is about a group of different women on their own paths, brought together to share their lives with an audience.” Ayanda, widow of late gospel singer Sfiso Ncwane, said people would get to see a different side of her. “Viewers can expect a more fun side of Ayanda, as opposed to the serious lady who always talks business and the Bible,” she said. The businesswoman said she wanted to inspire other wives. “I want them to know it’s crucial to remain visible in a marriage,” she said. “Never dump your dreams at the door of your marriage, because a wife who’s lost herself and her dreams in a marriage eventually become unsatisfied. “When the husband departs, the wife must continue living and not struggle to start from scratch again.”
