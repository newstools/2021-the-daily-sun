A lot is often said about sex and how long it should last. From stimulating quickies to longer rounds and strokes, the duration of sex has always been a quality control measure. The Guinness Book of Records has recorded a lot of sex related records globally, including the longest sex ever had. For instance, Masanobu Soto from Japan made his country proud by masturbating for nine hours and 58 minutes. He beat the previous world record, which was also his, by 28 minutes. In 1966, doctors from the Center for Marital and Sexual Studies in California said that a woman enjoyed 134 orgasms over the course of an hour. Then, the big one was in 2004 when American porn actress Lisa Sparks held the record for highest frequency of sex. She won a sex marathon where she poked 919 men in 24 hours. Each sexual intercourse lasted an average of 45 seconds. Does reading the above record make us sexually unfit?
