TAKING pictures of yourself in uniform as a member of the South African Police Service and posting it on social media is considered a serious misconduct. According to the National Instruction 5 of 2017 media communication in the South African Police, no member may have a profile picture of themselves in uniform. This came to light following social media users poking fun of pictures of young cop. While commenting on a picture that had been making the rounds on Facebook, one user asked: “Are the SAPS recruiting children now?” While some questioned their age, some questioned if they would be able to tackle thugs. Facebook user Zandile Zandie commented on one picture captioned Paw Patrol, writing: “South Africa is not serious about fighting crime.” Another user, Ser Mo, wrote: “Those teens will never arrest anyone in Mamelodi.” Shiraaj van Harte wrote: “How are they supposed to keep a suspect down to be arrested? Our overweight officers are already getting beaten up.” On the other hand, some users were rather disgusted by the comments. They hailed the officers and SAPS for hiring young people who would be able to work hard and not get easily tired when doing their job. Sylvie Nadar wrote: “Congrats young men, we salute you for your great courage & accomplishment. Go out there and prove your worth to our beloved country South Africa.” Zezethu Bala wrote: “These young men will actually catch you when they chase you. I’m certain.” Aisha Cassiem wrote: “These young men could have chosen drugs and gangsterism, but they chose to serve in the police. Stop discouraging them.”
