Dear MizzB Iâ€™VE been in a relationship with my boyfriend for three years. Last month I tested positive for Covid-19 and my boyfriend has since been distant. He hardly checks up on me. Does he still love me? Dear Sister Fear is a powerful tool that we face and tackle in different ways. Covid-19 is a virus that has scared a lot of people. Your boyfriend is probably afraid to be close to you because you are infected. If you do reach out to him you will find out what is the real reason for him to be so distant. Support can be shown to people during and after quarantine without being there physically. Communication at all times will help keep the fire burning.
