WESTERN Cape boxing has lost their two boxing jewels Abdul-Aziz “Arabian Knights” Kunert and Ishmael Kadri to the Gauteng province. The two boxing sensations from the Cape Flats have moved to Joburg in a bid to take their boxing careers to new heights. Kunert, unbeaten in 10 outings and Kadri who is yet to fight in the paid ranks, have joined the star-dubbed Colin Nathan’s Hot Box gym. The Joburg-based stable is home to some world-class Mzansi fighters such as IBF flyweight champion Moruti Mthalane, former two-weight world champion Hekkie Budler, IBF contender Azinga Fuzile and the former IBO champion, Simphiwe Khonco. The pair have joined the long list of fighters around the country and on the African continent who migrated to Gauteng in a quest to take their careers to the next level. Kunert said he has left his Cape Town mentor Emil Brice. “Yes, I’m moving to Gauteng, and Colin is my new trainer and manager now. “I have reached out to Colin for advice and asked if he can guide me and he agreed. I felt that my career was stagnant and things weren’t happening. “There are many things that led to my decision to join the Hot Box team but one that really pushed me is the confusion for the SA featherweight championship,” said Kunert. It was announced that the youngster would fight for national featherweight title against fellow Western Cape opponent Thembani Mbangatha early this year, but the Covid-19 pandemic knocked out those plans. In a new twist, Mbangatha was approved to meet Asanda Gingqi for the same crown. Nathan, the reigning Boxing South Africa (BSA) Trainer of the Year, has vowed to help him get his SA title shot. “Kunert wants the SA title shot and he deserves it. That’s   what we’re going to aim for.”
