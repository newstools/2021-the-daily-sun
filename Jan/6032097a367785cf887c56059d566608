A TRIP to buy chickens almost ended tragically for three men. This after three thugs pointed guns at them and took them to the bush. They then told them not to scream. But one of the victims coughed loudly and paid a heavy price for it as he was stabbed with a screwdriver in the legs. The thugs, who wore balaclavas, then searched the men and took more than R13 000, which the men had in their pockets. One of the victims, William Ndlazi (34), told Daily Sun they were on their way to stock chickens in Zuurbekom, Westonaria on Friday, 15 January. He said they were driving in a Nissan bakkie when they were suddenly stopped by a big rock in the middle of the gravel road. They got out of the van to remove the rock, but were suddenly confronted by the thugs, who ordered them to go into the bush. William said he had R3 500 in his pocket when the thugs robbed them. “We saw three men pointing guns at us and there was nothing we could do,” he said. “My mistake was to cough and they thought I was bringing attention to them. They stabbed me with a screwdriver,’ he said. William said the road led to the mine and mine security patrolled the area. “They thought I was trying to alert the security.” Another victim, Alberto Chisakama (33), said thugs took his last R5 000. “My heart is sore. I’ve been saving the money only to lose it just like that.” The third victim, Daniel Khoza (51), said the thugs took R4 669 from him. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Linkie Lefakane said a case of armed robbery was opened and cops were looking for the suspects.
