BAROKA coach Matsimela Thoka is appealing to his players to start the New Year on a high note to avoid putting themselves under unnecessary pressure. Baroka’s good form, which they displayed in the start of the 2020/21 season, took a nosedive as they struggled in December and dropped down to seventh on the log. Thoka said they need to get back to winning ways when they face TS Galaxy in their first DStv Premiership match of 2021 at Mbombela Stadium on Tuesday at 5pm. Bakgaga are coming into this clash having suffered two consecutive defeats to Bloemfontein Celtic and SuperSport United. “This is a must win for us,” said Thoka “We ended last season bad and we cannot afford to continue with that form. We have been preparing for this clash since the end of last season. We never went for Christmas break as we were busy working on our mistakes and fitness. We are fit and we are looking forward to this clash.” However, Thoka admitted that it won’t be an easy game as the Mpumalanga-based side will be motivated as they have a new coach. Galaxy sacked Dan Malesela in December and appointed assistant coach Zipho Dlangalala on an interim basis and he will be on the bench tonight. Struggling Galaxy are coming to this clash without a win in six straight league games, having lost three and drawn three. The last time the PSL rookies won a league match was in October when they beat AmaZulu 1-0. “It’s not easy to play against a team that has new coach as you will not know what type of football they will play,” said Thoka. “We know Galaxy which was coached by Malesela but we don’t know about the new coach. We are expecting a tough game but we have to do all we can to get good results as it has been long since we tasted victory.”
