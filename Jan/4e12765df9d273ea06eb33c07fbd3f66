Up-and-coming musician Siphesihle Zulu, featured by maskandi heavyweights in their hit songs, is ready to face the music world alone. Siphesihle from Empangeni in KZN has already made a name for herself in the music scene after she was featured by Khuzani “King Khuba” Mpungose in two songs – Utsotsi and Ubhuti Wabantu – in 2019 and 2020, respectively. She was also featured in the controversial song of maskandi legends Izingane Zoma, Iphenti Lami, released last month. She was the first female artist to be featured by Izingane Zoma since they were formed in 1993. ALSO READ:ACTOR NAY MAPS SUFFERS ANOTHER BLOW Siphesihle said she’s working on new songs. She said her craziness in studio will determine whether she’ll release an EP or an album. She learned a lot from working with Khuzani and Izingane Zoma. “They taught me to be myself to impress my audience,” she told SunBuzz. “I was so scared when Khuzani asked me to work with him. “When we were in studio, he told me not to panic and be myself.” Siphesihle said it had always been her biggest dream to work with Izingane Zoma. “I felt like I was dreaming when I was called to record a song with the group,” she said. “I was scared because I know Izingane Zoma are perfectionists when it comes to music. “They took me as their child and showed me the way. They told me to sing my style. “I love their music so much I’d readily join them if they asked me to.” Siphesihle was discovered by Khuzani in 2019 when videos of her singing and dancing went viral on social media.
