THE Cosafa of Southern African Football Associations
(Cosafa) has resolved to throw its weight behind Patrice Motsepe in the Caf
presidency race. The decision followed a meeting of the region’s football
governing body executive committee led by president Phillip Chinyangwa. Motsepe is one of the four candidates, namely; Jacques
Anouma of Ivory Coast‚ Mauritania’s Ahmed Yahya and Augustin Senghor of
Senegal, who will be vying for the highest position in Caf in the election in
March. According to Chinyangwa, Cosafa will be voting as a bloc,
guaranteeing the South African businessman a total of 14 votes which will be
crucial in his bid to succeed Ahmad Ahmad as the eighth Caf president as is the
biggest voting bloc. “I can safely confirm that the Cosafa Exco has endorsed the
candidature of Patrice Motsepe such that the bloc should support him since he
is the only candidate from our region. We trust that most of Cosafa members are happy with him. We
know that he is a capable man, who will no doubt get unanimous support
throughout Africa. “We are now fully-fledged on the campaign for his
candidature to succeed president Ahmad Ahmad. We trust it will be a successful
mission. “Motsepe comes in as a success story of many many years,
from business to sports administration and many other things. He is a qualified
lawyer by profession and a successful businessman. Let's all rally behind him for the successful Caf elections
in March.”
