THE marking of the matric examinations got off to a bad start. Some markers pulled out, citing fear of Covid-19, while more than 230 tested positive. But the Department of Basic Education believed they were still on track to finish the marking before the end of the month. Briefing the media yesterday, the department’s director-general Mathanzima Mweli said he was confident with the progress made. This after a meeting was held over the weekend with key partners. “It is because of this commitment from colleagues in the marking centres that we feel we are still on schedule to complete marking as scheduled on 22 January,” he said. He said the markers who withdrew were replaced, and confirmed that marking had started in all provinces. “A total of 2 703 markers, out of 46 024, have withdrawn from the 181 marking centres.” Mweli said about 238 across the country tested positive for coronavirus, with one death reported. He said this was because there was anxiety and fear among markers and their families. “The majority of the infections were reported in the Eastern Cape, where most of the markers reported they recently attended weddings, funerals or family ceremonies.”
