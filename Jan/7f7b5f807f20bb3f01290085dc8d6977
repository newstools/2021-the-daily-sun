MARITZBURG United coach Ernst Middendorp says it was good to win for the first time and “get connected with other teams” after his side defeated a Covid-19 wracked Bloemfontein Celtic 2-1 at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday. Middendorp said this was the great first step towards climbing up on the log table as they have been bottom since this season started. The win sees Maritzburg move off the bottom to number 15 though they have played a game more than Black Leopards, who now occupy the bottom of the table. However, Middendorp was ecstatic to see his side finally get over the line to end a 14-game winless streak since beating now relegated Polokwane City in March before the season was suspended due to Covid-19 pandemic. When it resumed in August, the team, along with Rise and Shine and Golden Arrows, finished the season in a bio bubble without winning a single match. With that continuing in the new season, Maritzburg decided to part ways with Eric Tinkler and brought in the former Kaizer Chiefs coach. Middendorp is the messiah of the Team of Choice every time they have their backs against the wall. He found them in similar position in the 2015-16 season and saved them in the last game of that season. “The entire institution of Maritzburg United has been waiting for it. It was three points needed at the beginning of the year,” said Middendorp, whose club signed Clayton Daniels. “It is good to get connected to the rest of the pack. But each and every player can do more in particular in the second half. The game was not managed in the way I wanted it.” What aided Maritzburg to get the first win of the season was that five players, who tested positive for Covid-19 and missed the previous game against Stellenbosch FC, were back in the side. One of those was Thabiso Kutumela, who scored a brace against Celtic.
