Eating food and drinking water are basic necessities of life. Whenever these activities are terminated abruptly, people stop existing. We breathe foul air in the Joburg CBD because people defaecate and urinate everywhere. We also breathe bad air in places like Hillbrow and Doornfontein. There are no good public toilets. The existing ones are always closed or opened for a limited time. Since lockdown started in March last year, most public toilets are closed. Taxi ranks, petrol stations and some shopping centres charge between R2 and R3 for relieving yourself. In a poverty-stricken country where unemployment has reached unprecedented levels, where should people get money to pay to pee? It all boils down to an uncaring government. What angers me the most is that some ranks have no toilet facilities at all, but the adjacent shopping centres charge commuters who hold key purchasing power. Where are their moral scruples? Additionally, the inequalities of our country are laid bare. In remote upmarket areas, shopping centres charge no fee, but in densely populated down-market areas, a fee is demanded. To arrest and charge people for public indecency would be violating their human rights. The government should take full responsibility to render this essential service, lest we degenerate into a cesspool of poopland.
