Multi-award winning poet Mbali “MaGcwabe” Mkhize was trained by Afro jazz singer and cultural expert, Mbuso Khoza. MaGcwabe, who’s originally from Esikhaleni in northern KZN, collaborated on and recorded Isandlwana with Mbuso. The song honours Zulu heroes who fought in 1879 at the Battle of Isandlwana, the first major encounter in the Anglo-Zulu War between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. The two are preparing to release a six-track EP, which has a bit of poetry and traditional music. MaGcwabe, who’s been a poet for seven years, told SunBuzz she thought she was a master poet until she started working with Mbuso. He taught her many things. “I nearly cried during the recording because he was strict, correcting a lot of things about my poetry,” she said. “The experience was great, although it took us the whole day to record one song. “I realise now that I needed Mbuso as a mentor. My career is blossoming.

She wa honoured with special Best Poet award at the Satmas last year. Of late, she recites praise poems while Mbuso sings amahubo. “I feel humbled to be working with such a legendary musician and learning history and music,” she said. “I’ve learnt to recite my poems while someone sings next to me.” She’s written praise poems about the late Princess Magogo Buthelezi, mother of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and about Ukhozi FM. “Although we still have to record both songs, I’ve already performed the one about Princess Magogo at the Bat Centre and the Durban Playhouse. I received a warm welcome.” To give up-and-coming poets a platform to showcase their talents, she’s hosted the annual Poetic Night with MaGcwabe twice.
