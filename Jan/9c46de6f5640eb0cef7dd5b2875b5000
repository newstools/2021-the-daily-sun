A GOOD friend will stand by you in good and bad times. And he will try to save you from getting arrested by following you to the police station when you are bust. But a man ended up joining his friend in police cells after the cops discovered that the car he was driving was stolen. Captain Solomon Sibiya of Kagiso Police Station in Mogale City said the first suspect (27) was found selling designer clothes at the corner of Impala Road and David Webster Street in Tshepisong on Monday, 18 January. “Members of Gauteng traffic were posted at the Kagiso policing precinct when they spotted the suspect’s vehicle facing oncoming traffic. It was surrounded by a group of people,” he said. People started fleeing in different directions as the traffic police approached. “The officers stopped next to the suspect’s vehicle and noticed new designer clothing items in the back seat,” he said. Sibiya said when the police asked him to produce proof of purchase, the suspect couldn’t. He was charged with possession of suspected stolen items. As the police were still busy with the detention process, the suspect’s friend arrived and tried to plead for his freedom. Police immediately conducted investigations into his vehicle.  Sibiya said the friend was also arrested and charged with possession of a stolen vehicle. The two suspects will appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court soon. Police are also investigating to determine if the first suspect could be linked to a robbery that took place at the Westgate Shopping Centre last week.
