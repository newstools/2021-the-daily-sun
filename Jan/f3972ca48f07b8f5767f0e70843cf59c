BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic will have to await a decision from the Confederations of African Football (CAF) regarding the status of the Caf Confederations Cup second leg fixture against Nigerian side Rivers United. The match was pencilled in for Wednesday in Port Harcourt. However, Celtic haven’t travelled to Nigeria, owing to strict Covid-19 protocols in Nigeria. According to the procedure in Nigeria, visitors from high risk countries must be quarantined for seven days upon arrival in the country. South Africa is regarded as one of the high-risk countries whose visitors are required to undergo this process. And the Nigerian authorities have insisted that Celtic would not be given preferential treatment with regards to their strict regulations. Celtic have since written to both the Nigerian FA and government, through Safa, requesting for this requirement to be waived. But their request has been turned down by the Nigerian government, forcing Safa to seek further guidance from Caf. CAF have replied to the football association, saying they will investigate the matter and decide on the way forward. “In view of the letter received from the Nigerian Football Federation last night, (Tuesday, 5 January 2021) stating that the South African delegation cannot be exempted from the required quarantine, we would like to inform you that the match shall not take place as scheduled,” read the correspondence from Caf. “We hereby inform you that the case will be submitted to the competent body within CAF to decide on the appropriate course of action to follow. The decision shall be communicated in due time.”
