A FORMER Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality spokesman has been sent to jail for four years after breaching the conditions of his suspended sentence for fraud. In May 2018 Roland Williams was sentenced to three years of correctional supervision by the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court and his sentence was suspended four years. He was fined R30 000 and was instructed to repay Santam the R96 000 he defrauded the company. He was to pay through monthly instalments of R3500 from 3 May 2018 to 31 May 2020. Williams had earlier pleaded guilty for false claiming more than R115 000 from Santam for an accident that never happened. NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakazi said: “Williams had deliberately caused extensive damage to his BMW in order to claim from Santam. Williams was experiencing engine problems with his car. “Santam submitted an affidavit to the state reporting William had defaulted. He last made payment in October 2019 as a result still owed them R 40 000,” she said. “He was then rearrested in November 2020 by the Hawks at his home in Port Elizabeth. Williams then paid the outstanding R40 000 a few days after his arrest. “Williams’ attorney then immediately submitted an application for leave to appeal which senior state prosecutor Advocate Lise Keech opposed.” “Magistrate Lionel Lindoor dismissed Williams’ application and sent him to jail for four years,” said Ngcakazi.
