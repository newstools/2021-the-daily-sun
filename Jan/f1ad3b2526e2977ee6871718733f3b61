AS covid-19 numbers sky rocket on a daily basis in Mzansi. The EFF President Julius Malema has announced that umjolo (dating) is suspended in a bid to flatten the curve. Malema made this unexpected announcement during the EFF’s virtual media briefing on Thursday where he spoke on the party’s stance on the shocking high infections and covid-19 deaths. He said as some people in the country are placing the ‘no visitors allowed’ signage at their gates, even those who are dating should refrain from visiting each other. “You don’t know where your boyfriend or girlfriend has been. It is only us, the married ones we are safe because we know each other’s whereabouts. The put stay at home." "No mjojo, mjolo is suspended until after corona because we don’t know where you have been," he said. Malema also called for party members to refrain from attending funerals as opt for attending them through virtual platforms, unless they are close relatives with the deceased.
