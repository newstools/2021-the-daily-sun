WHEN 16-year-old Matimu Timbane from Giyani in Limpopo went missing last week Tuesday, a 21-year-old man was initially arrested for her disappearance and charged with kidnapping. Now the man faces a murder charge after the same girl who was allegedly last seen with him at a tavern at Mavalani Village on a Christmas Day was found killed and dumped in the Nsami River. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they started searching for both the suspect and the girl after the girl’s family reported her missing.  “The suspect was then traced by the police and arrested in Joburg on 5 January 2021. He appeared in the Giyani Magistrate Court yesterday, facing a charge of kidnapping. His case was remanded to 13 January 2021 for further police investigations. “After the family positively identified the deceased, the accused will now face an additional charge of murder when he again appears in court on 13 January. “Investigations into how the victim was murdered are still unfolding.” Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has praised the investigating team for arresting the suspect. “This arrest attests to our resolve as police that there will be no limits when hunting down perpetrators of heinous crimes such as this. I must however urge our communities, especially parents and guardians, to speedily report missing persons to the police and not wait for some days before doing so,” he said.
