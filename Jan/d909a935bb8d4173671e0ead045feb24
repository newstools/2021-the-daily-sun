If South Africa was to get rid of corrupt leaders, poverty and unemployment rates would go down. Everything is cut down and we’re told there’s no money, yet we see those close to corrupt leaders flashing cash and expensive cars. Fact is, poverty and unemployment figures will skyrocket if the ruling party doesn’t hold its corrupt leaders accountable. Our leaders are there to fill their own pockets and enrich those close to them. The ANC now needs to be at the forefront of holding its leaders to account for corruption and maladministration. Failing to do so will not only undermine Mandela’s proud legacy, but will also damage Mzansi’s prospects of solving its most pressing problems: poverty, unemployment and inequality. We need a new vision for this country. If people don’t work together, we’re in for major civil unrest. For the country to genuinely change, the ruling party will have to change. God help South Africa. Letter Slight Ramphaka, Florida
