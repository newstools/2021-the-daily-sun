TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach Joel Masutha says he is not concerned about losing his job as his focus is on his team. The DStv Premiership rookies have now gone four straight league matches without a win after suffering a 2-0 defeat to Stellenbosch FC at Danie Craven Stadium on Tuesday. The last time TTM tasted victory was last November when they beat their Limpopo rivals Baroka FC 1-0 at Thohoyandou Stadium. Now there have been talks that Vhadau Vha Damani boss Masala Mulaudzi might sack the former Black Leopards coach if his side lose their next league game against Cape Town City in Thohoyandou on Saturday (5pm). But Masutha yesterday said he is not worried about his job, as he and his lads are now focusing on their next league game against The Citizens. “I have been in coaching for a while and I understand how things work,” said Masutha. “When you decide that you want to be a coach you should be ready for the pressure this job can bring. “There are ups and downs in coaching and you should have a strong heart. As for me, I don’t worry about losing the job as I only focus on my job and to bring this team back to winning ways. We have a crucial game on Saturday and we need to be fully focused and work on building the players’ confidence. Hopefully, we will get a positive result at home and move up on the log.” On their 2-0 defeat to Stellies, Masutha said: “I think we should have won that game, but we missed many scoring chances. We even got a penalty in the first half and Thabo Rakhale missed it. I think we should have scored four or more goals in the first half. But in the second half we were tired and got punished. We hope to be better on Saturday.”
