THIEVES have left hip hop sensation- turned-farmer Mo’Molemi with a massive headache. Mo’Molemi, whose real name is Motlapele Morule, has been forced to temporarily shut down the farmers’ market he opened in Mahikeng, North West, in October due to crime. “Since we opened our doors last year, we’ve had two break-ins and an attempted one,” he said. “The alarming thing is that they managed to disable the alarm system and the security company didn’t pick it up.” Mo’Molemi had already lost R20 000 to theft. “They stole our processing equipment, some stock, a vacuum sealer, wrapping machine, gazebo and cash register.” Mo’Molemi now plans to only do business online. “It has become a liability to continue in the current space. The location is ideal but I’m running at a loss due to crime. “Although this has been a huge setback, it has not discouraged me because I have a great client base that knows what I have to offer. I’ve taken my business online until I find a suitable space.” ALSO READ |ZODWA TAKES THE CORONA TEST He reported the crimes but nothing was done. “After every incident I called the police first. They always attend to us and leave us hopeful but never give results. “I’m not happy with their work in terms of investigating and catching the criminals. It seems they do the paperwork but not the real work.” Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said investigations are under way, but no arrests have been made yet.
