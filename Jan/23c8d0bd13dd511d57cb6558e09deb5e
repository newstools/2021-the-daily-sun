A MATRIC exam marker has succumbed to Covid-19 in the Eastern Cape. The marker was stationed at the Aliwal North matric exam marking centre. This was confirmed by Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Lubabalo Mabuyane and MEC of Education Fundile Gade during a visit to the Nyanga exam marking centre in Ngcobo on Friday (15 January). They both sent their condolences to the colleagues and family members of the marker. Mabuyane said: “Covid-19 is a challenge. We are sending our condolences to all families who have lost their loved ones due to Covid-19. Even today we woke up to the shocking news of the passing of some prominent business people in the province ­­- in Butterworth and Alice,” he said. He said he understands that teachers are risking their lives every day and they appreciate the hard work they put in.  He said of the 7 768 markers who were sent to marking centres across the province, around 292 have tested positive for Covid-19  - making it 3,8%. MEC Gade said the 3,8% in terms of infections during the marking process is an indication of what can be expected come the reopening of schools in the province. “We are going to make this a benchmark for our school readiness,” said Gade. Both Mabuyane and Gade applauded exam markers stationed at various centres across the province for their great job so far. Speaking about the Nyanga exam marking centre, Gade said they are happy with the report they have received from the centre manager and the staff. “We are also happy with the marking process itself as they are wrapping up in the space of four to five days to come,” he said. About 133 exam markers are stationed at Nyanga. And according to the Nyanga exam marking centre manager Nompumelelo Mkhutshulwa, 11 people have tested positive for Covid-19. The 11 who’ve tested positive include three markers, four examination assistants and four kitchen staff members.
