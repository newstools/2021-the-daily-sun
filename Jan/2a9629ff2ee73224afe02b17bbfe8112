I’m not here to play but to deliver. “This will be a token of my appreciation to those who’ve supported uThando and made it as big as it was. “Without their support we wouldn’t have reached milestones.” The singer, who studied music at the National School of the Arts, said her big break has taught her a lot. “I’ve been in the music game for about six years, but I believe uThando was my big break,” said Souflul G. “It has changed my life and opened more doors for me. I got to learn more about the industry and got a better understanding of it. “I learned a lot about self-discipline, and I want to launch my own brand of sunglasses as I have created a name for myself.” Buyisa is available on all digital platforms.
