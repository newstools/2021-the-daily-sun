HE was a soldier who died with his boots on. That is how the late Transport MEC Bheki Ntuli (63) from Mtubatuba, KZN, was described. He was also described as a humble, loyal and kind servant of the people. Ntuli died yesterday in a Durban hospital due to Covid-19 complications. The news of his death left the provincial government saddened. In a statement released by Premier Sihle Zikalala on behalf of the provincial government, he said: “We are deeply shocked and extremely hurt by this.” Affectionately known by his clan name Mphemba, he was appointed to the position of MEC in September 2019. “He is a soldier who died with his boots on. He was a team player who always led from the front, including when fighting Covid-19. He was often at the coalface of this epic battle since the first case was confirmed,” said the premier. Zikalala said as MEC, Ntuli always tackled his tasks and responsibilities with energy in spite of their complex and sensitive nature. He had started to implement programmes aimed at reversing the tide of gender-based violence and taxi violence. “He previously served as a shop steward in the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa, and was involved in the formation of ANC structures in the then northern Natal region,” Zikalala said. “Mphemba got a lot of respect as a peacemaker at the height of political violence between ANC and IFP in northern Natal,” said the premier. “He served for more than 20 years as a member and leader of the ANC sub-committee on peace and stability.” Ntuli also served as the chairman of the Council of the University of Zululand, and held a number of tertiary qualifications. KZN DA leader Zwakele Mncwango sent heartfelt condolences to Ntuli’s family.
