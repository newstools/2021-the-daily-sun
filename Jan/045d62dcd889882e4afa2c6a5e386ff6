AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy says his “patience is running out” and players should look at themselves in the mirror after they dropped more points in their 1-1 DStv Premiership draw against SuperSport United the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday. McCarthy said he’ll speak to his chairman Sandile Zungu to add more firepower into the squad because what is happening is frustrating him. AmaZulu head to Limpopo to face tricky Baroka FC at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday(5pm), where McCarthy will be looking for a better outcome as his side have not won in the last four games. “Same old, same old,” said the former Porto (2003-2006), Blackburn Rovers (2006–2010) and West Ham United (2010–2011) striker. “You play well, you dominate games, you create clear cut chances and players just take things for granted,” said McCarthy, who is seeking his second league win against Bakgaga. “You can’t dominate every game, but since I walked through the door I have nothing to show for it. It is a bit frustrating. “My patience is running out. When you throw points away like this and no one wants to take accountability, your job becomes very difficult. Against Bloemfontein Celtic (1-1 draw) it was the same situation. Kaizer Chiefs, we lost the game 1-0 it was the same. Maritzburg (0-0) on last Sunday it was exactly the same situation.” With the January transfer window having opened on Monday, McCarthy said he’ll sit down with his chairman Zungu to bolster his squad. McCarthy took over the club that dominated the off season transfer window, but the former Cape Town City coach said it was not enough and the squad need strengthening. “Now that the transfer window is open, I’m sure my chairman does see that we need to add to the squad. Yes, the squad is good but there’s a missing piece in the puzzle. “Hopefully, we’ll able to go into the transfer market and bring in someone who wants to win games for us,” added McCarthy.
