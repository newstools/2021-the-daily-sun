AS Tropical Cyclone Eloise made its way in some parts of Limpopo since last night, main roads in the Mopani district were badly affected and motorists were advised to drive with caution. This after three trees fell onto the road surface on the R71 in Magoebaskloof and R528 in George’s Valley outside Tzaneen due to the heavy rains and strong winds. A bridge on the R36, next to Khutjwana Village outside Tzaneen, was also flooded and not safe for motorists. Limpopo transport spokesman Matome Moremi-Taueatsoala said there were heavy rains across the province, particularly in the Mopani district. He encouraged motorists to drive with caution.  “Before driving in these wet conditions, drivers need to ensure their tyres are in good condition, with the lights and indicators working perfectly. Further more, avoid speeding as most roads are flooded,” he said. As the heavy rain and storms were expected to end midweek, the Limpopo Department of Social Development activated psychosocial support teams to provide assistance.  Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale said in response to the imminent natural disaster, her department was ready to provide social relief of distress, including food parcels, blankets and other basic amenities to displaced families. “We’ve also started mobilising the private sector to come on board to ensure that we beef up our state of readiness of cooked meals, particularly in the Vhembe and Mopani districts,” she said.
