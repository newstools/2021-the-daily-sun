SUSPECTS are behind bars for bribery and for the contravention of the disaster management act regulations. The JMPD spokesman, Xolani Fihla told Daily Sun that JMPD undercover officers spotted two suspicious vehicles, Toyota Tazz and a bakkie and stopped it. He said the vehicles and occupants were searched and while searching, officers found alcohol loaded in both vehicles. "The occupants were questioned, and they led officers to a liquor outlet at Fox Street between Hans and Gus Streets in Jeppestown where they had bought the alcohol," said Fihla. Fihla said officers noticed vehicles lined up outside the liquor outlet and it is suspected that they were also there to buy alcohol. "All those vehicles fled the scene. Officers approached the manager and informed him of what had occurred," he said. The manager called his son to the scene and when the son arrived, he offered members of SAPS Tactical Reaction a R40 000 bribe. "They were both apprehended immediately," said Fihla. He said five suspects were arrested and detained at Jeppe SAPS. "Four suspects were arrested for the contravention of the Disaster Management Act by selling, dispensing and transporting liquor," he said. "One suspect was arrested for bribery, and alcohol worth approximately R1 000 000 was seized and booked in Jeppe SAPS," he added.
