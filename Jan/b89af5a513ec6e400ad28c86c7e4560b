GOLDEN Arrows on-form winger Velemseni Ndwandwe says their brilliant run this season is because all the players are hungry to achieve success and to show their skills. The 24-year-old is in the best form of his career right now. He has scored four goals in 11 DStv Premiership appearances for Abafana Bes’Thende to help the Durban-based club remain unbeaten this campaign. They are one of three unbeaten teams in the Premiership alongside leaders Mamelodi Sundowns and second-placed Swallows FC. “We are a family,” said Ndwandwe. “We approach every game to get a positive result. It is either one point or three points, but not to lose.” Kaizer Chiefs, Swallows, Sundowns and SuperSport United all went home from Durban without gaining maximum points against Arrows this season, under rookie coach Mandla Ncikazi. Another big test lies ahead as they visit Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday. Ndwandwe said Pirates will suffer the same fate as other teams have this season. “We have not lost to any of the three top teams we have played so far,” boasted Ndwandwe. “Pirates are a different side, but we don’t doubt ourselves against them. In the games that we have played, we missed chances. If we had put those chances away, we would have been talking something different.” Ndwandwe scored the only goal in Arrows 1-0 win over Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) at the Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu on Saturday to net his fourth goal this season. Before the game, Ndwandwe was honoured by the club when he was presented with a framed jersey to celebrate his 50th match for the club.
