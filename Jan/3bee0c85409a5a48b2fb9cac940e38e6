THE Department of Basic Education has invited candidates to register for the 2021 supplementary matric exams scheduled for May and June. This is a second opportunity to do so for candidates who registered for the November 2020 exam but may not have satisfied the requirements for a certificate. The exams are scheduled to commence on 5 May 2021. Basic education spokesman, Elijah Mhlanga, said candidates can register for the exams online through http://www.eservices.gov.za/. Alernatively, they can do so at their nearest education district office. Mhlanga said the exams are also open to candidates who couldn’t sit or finish the exam due to medical reasons, a death in the family, or other special reason. According to Mhlanga, the exams form part of the education department’s second chance matric support programme. Support material for pupils is available through the programme. He said further information may be found on the education department’s website. “Candidates not satisfied with their results are able to apply for either a remark or recheck,” Mhlanga told Daily Sun. He said application forms for remarking or rechecking of exam answer scripts are available from schools or exam centres. “The department will continue to work together with provincial education departments to ensure the sustained integrity of the matric exams and to maintain the safety of candidates and officials as the nation continues to respond to Covid-19,” he said. The department would release the 2020 National Senior Certificate exam results to candidates on 23 February 2021. It would continue with the extensive preparation for the conduct, administration and management of the 2021 May and June exams.
