NUMSA members started picketing outside Macsteel offices all over the country on Monday, 18 January. Workers picketed outside Macsteel’s Cape Town offices and demanded that retrenchments stop and 99 retrenched workers be reinstated. Western Cape Numsa secretary, Vuyo Lufele, said the company was using Covid-19 to unfairly let go of workers. “We’re defending jobs of our members. Macsteel couldn’t convince us of the reasons why they’re retrenching,” he said. He said 99 staff had been retrenched, despite 150 agreeing to voluntary retrenchment. “The company is only doing this for profit and to increase packages for management. The strike will continue until the company returns those who’ve been retrenched.” In a statement, Numsa spokeswoman Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said workers in the Eastern and Western Cape, KZN, Gauteng and Mpumalanga would go on strike. “It’s inhumane to retrench workers during a pandemic, especially over Christmas. “Macsteel is using the pandemic to boost profit margins. They retrenched workers and the savings made from job cuts were used to pay managers and executives generous bonuses. “This is what angered our members to go on strike.” Macsteel said it regretted the need for the 99 retrenchments, in its efforts to adapt to worsening economic conditions. It said it announced its intention to retrench staff in June last year and consulted unions and non-unionised parties to minimise implementation of Section 189A retrenchments. “We consulted in accordance with the law to reach consensus on the latest decisions, including possible alternatives. “Our priority has been to protect remaining jobs. We recognise unions’ right to protest and urge those participating to act within the law.”
