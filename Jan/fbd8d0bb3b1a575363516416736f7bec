JUSTIN Shonga has been unveiled as a new Cape Town City player following his departure from Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). SunSport reported that the former Orlando Pirates player was in the Mother City yesterday where he was on the verge of penning a deal with the Citizens. TTM were in the dark as to the whereabouts of the Zambian international. “I am at training and where I am happy,” Shonga told SunSport on Monday. “Can you call me back later and I will tell you everything.” But when SunSport called him later, Shonga did not answer his phone. The 24-year-old, who has been one of the star players for Tshakhuma this season after joining them last October from the Soweto giants, did not return to the Venda-based side after the festive season holiday break. A source told SunSport that Shonga had no desire to play for Vhadau Vha Damani as he claims they owe him money. “Shonga played for Pirates where everything is professional, but things were different at Tshakhuma and that frustrated him and he wanted to leave,” said our source. Tshakhuma have been reported to be struggling financially and rumours are that club boss Mosala Malaudzi is selling the DStv Premiership rookies’ status to a businessman in the North West province. Shonga will be hoping to make his debut for the Citizens when they host Kaizer Chiefs at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday (5pm). Signed. Sealed. Shonga. ??#iamCityFC pic.twitter.com/svODcZ52zy
