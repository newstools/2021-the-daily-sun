Beauty pageant, Miss Gauteng Exclusive, has taken a step towards fighting poverty in Mzansi. As part of their activities this year, the pageant adopted two families, to make their Christmas. One of the co-founders of the pageant, Annwen “MissJ” Jordan told The People’s Paper this project was inspired by a family they met. “We were approached by a social worker who told us about a family that needed help. It’s a family of a single mum, who’s struggling and doesn’t have anything for her babies. We decided to buy food for her family,” said Miss Jay “However, we thought about the future, about how she was going to feed her kids for the coming months. So we got more food in bulk donations to them. Food that’ll last them for six months,” she continued. The second family’s case was different from the first. “The second person we helped is a student with no parents. She didn’t need food, but needed financial assistance for school. She dropped out because she owed fees and we raised funds to pay off her debt. She will now be able to go back to school,” said MissJ. ALSO READ | ESTHER'S PAGEANT DREAM COMES TRUE!

And that touched us, we want people to see how bad poverty is in South Africa and that we should all help one anothe. We will also continue with this project yearly. We’ve seen its impact,” she said. The Top 25 beauty queens will battle it out for the crown on the finale, next year. “The finalists and Miss Gauteng Exclusive will be crowned. However, things are different this time, as everyone in the Top 5 will be crowned. We added a Miss Public Choice and Miss Social Influencer, which will be taken by number 4 and 5,” said MissJ.
