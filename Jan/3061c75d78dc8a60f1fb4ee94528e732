CYCLONE Eloise has been battering parts of Mzansi since Sunday. Mpumalanga Disaster Management general manager Lucky Ngomane told Daily Sun houses and cars were flooded in Mattafin outside Mbombela. Roads in Sabie and Lydenburg were also affected, with strong winds uprooting trees. In Bushbuckridge, about 100 families had to be evacuated to church halls after their roofs were blown off. The storm also damaged electricity poles and streets. Single mum Maria Sibuyi (59) from Cottondale outside Acornhoek, said: “We saw the roof come off and the walls collapsed. “We ran for our lives and are grateful to Councillor Samson Makhubela and his committee for rescuing us.”  In Mkhulu near Hazyview, more than 49 houses were damaged and Councillor Bhunu Malandule’s team rescued families. Bushbuckridge municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said: “The storm had a severe impact. Villages were left without houses. Victims will be accommodated in churches. Social development will provide food parcels.” Sergeant Mkhatshwa (40), who lost everything, said: “I thought it was a helicopter but then my roof came off. I managed to cover one of my children but the other was injured. We had to hide under a table.” Co-operative governance spokesman George Mthethwa said R18 million was set aside to deal with emergencies. Ehlanzeni region was most affected and relief materials were sent to municipalities.
