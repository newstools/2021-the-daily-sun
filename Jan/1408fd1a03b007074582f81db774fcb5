HER love for food touched many lives, and news of her death left Mzansi shattered. Yesterday, shocked South Africans learnt that author and legendary chef Dorah Sitole died from a coronavirus-related illness. According to her family, the former magazine editor died in a Joburg hospital on Sunday after testing positive for the virus two weeks ago. Her son Sbu said at the time of her death, Dorah was being treated in the ICU. He told Daily Sun that before being infected with the virus, his mother was healthy and excited about her latest book Dorah Sitole: 40 Years of Iconic Food, which had just been released. “We’re really sad. My mum was full of life and excited about the launch of her new book. We’ve lost a loving and supportive mother.” Sbu said the family would share details of the funeral with the public soon. Over the years, Dorah won a number of awards including the Galliova Food Writer and Stylist Award, as well as the SA Chef Association’s first Presidential Award in 2007. In 2019, she was named a South African food icon. Tributes soon came pouring in for Mam’ Dorah, as she was affectionately known. Her publisher, Human & Rousseau, described her as an icon who was loved by all who met her. Company CEO Eloise Wessels said: “Dorah was not only an icon of the South African culinary landscape, but also a pioneer in popularising African cooking and cuisine in a broader context. She was a lovely, kind and deeply generous person. We shall miss her terribly.” On Twitter, @KGMoeketsi said: “Want to love more. Life is short. The Dorah Sitole news are devastating.” Actress Rami Chuene said: “Bathong Mam’ Dorah Sitole? No maaan.” Priscilla Maeta said she was shocked. “Rest in peace Mam’ Dorah Sitole. I have known you from True Love’s kitchen sharing your expertise with us. Heaven gained an angel.” Author Sue Nyathi said: “May her soul rest in peace, such sad news.”
