EIGHT Free State markers from different matric marking centres have tested positive for Covid-19. According to the provincial department of education, those cases were reported from seven marking centres and about 60 teachers were withdrawn from the centres. Spokesman Howard Ndaba confirmed that members were found to be positive at Ficksburg High School, Oranje Meisies Skool, Brentpark High School, Rosenhof High School, Brebner High School, Landboudal School and HTS Louis Botha School. He said Ficksburg high grade 12 marking centre had two cases, and there was one case each at another six centres. “These markers have since been released from their centres and are at home for self-quarantine. We are very fortunate, as we’re left with only four days. Having 238 markers across the province and only eight who tested positive simply shows responsibility among our workers. The marking rooms were decontaminated where these markers were used.” The department is working closely with health employees and wellness officials to ensure compliance of Covid-19 protocols and that all centres have been provided with sufficient PEE. The SunTeam learnt that in Boshof, markers were sharing sleeping rooms, which could lead to an increase in cases. Ndaba said: “The process of marking is continuing smoothly. We’re coping so well. We’re confident to complete on the planned date of 21 January.”
