As the world continues to battle with Covid-19, many of us have taken this invaluable down-time to rediscover ourselves. And in the process, we have adopted new habits and hobbies. Part of the new norm is discovering our hidden talents and starting new hobbies to kill time during the hard lock downs. One of the most prominent hobbies that came out of this pandemic was painting. No, I’m not referring to the manual labour that involves changing the colours of your home. But, I’m referring to the Pablo Picasso type of painting that has seen us become artists of note. According to life coaches and psychologists, painting has a lot of therapeutic advantages. Firstly, painting teaches one the art of patience. It takes time for a masterpiece to take shape. Secondly, painting promotes creativity and anything depicted on a canvas is art, right? Lastly, it has everything for everyone. From acrylic colours, oil paints, poster colours to glass paints and pencil colours. It’s a rainbow nation of creativity.
