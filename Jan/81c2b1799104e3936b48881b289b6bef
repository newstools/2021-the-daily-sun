 SWALLOWS FC have started the New Year the same way they finished the last â€“ flying high. The Dube Birds ensured that their impressive start to the season continued when they beat Cape Town City 3-2 at Dobsonville Stadium on Tuesday. As has been the case so often this season, Ruzaigh Gamildien was the star of the show for the DStv Premiership newbies. He bagged yet another brace to join Mamelodi Sundowns ace Themba Zwane at the top of the scoring charts with seven goals. His goals also saw the Birds pull level with the defending champions, Downs, on 21 points at the top of the standings. Gamildien opened the scoring in the 39th minute from the penalty spot before adding the second just two minutes later when he dispatched a Kgaugelo Sekgota cross. Mduduzi Mdantsane also bagged a brace which was just a consolation for City while Junaid Sait scored the third for the Birds. Red cards for Zephania Mbokoma and Tashreeq Morris added some drama to the game.
