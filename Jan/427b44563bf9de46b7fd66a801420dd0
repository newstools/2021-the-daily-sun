Radio and television presenter Unathi Nkayi has scored a presenting gig. The talented media personality has announced that she’ll be hosting this year’s Cape Town International Jazz Festival which will be taking place online. She took to social media to share the good news. “I am honoured to have been asked by the festival to host their 2021 concert series Jazz Fix due to the fact that we cannot gather in Cape Town this year at Africa’s grandest stage,” she said. Earlier this month, the festival organisers announced they’ll be putting the physical event on hold. They said the decision to postpone the jazz festival was not taken lightly but made in the best interest of their valued festivalgoers.
