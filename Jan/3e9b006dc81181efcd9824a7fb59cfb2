RONALD Koeman said on Tuesday he needs more time to instil his ideas after his poor start as Barcelona coach. The pressure is already mounting on Koeman, whose future could become more uncertain when the club’s new president is voted in later this month. Asked when his methods will deliver better performances, Koeman said: “Little by little we are going to see it. “We have tried to take the team forward and to prepare them for the championship, but we have important players out injured and I’ve not been able to change much. I need more time to impose my ideas.” Koeman confirmed midfielder Carles Alena will be allowed to leave, with the 23-year-old expected to join Getafe on loan. But there are not likely to be many arrivals this month at Camp Nou, given the club’s perilous financial situation. “Every coach, every January is thinking about how they can improve their team,” said Koeman. “I’ve made a plan of ins and outs. If it is possible or not depends on the club.” – AFP
