Non-compliance to Covid-19 rules in public transportation is very concerning. There have been reports recently that taxis and bus companies are failing to adhere to Covid-19 safety measures. Thereâ€™s also mainly partial compliance to rules on using masks when travelling on public transport. People who fail to comply are mostly the ones who take the virus to their homes. They end up inadvertently infecting the elderly and those with comorbidity. Letter by Slight Ramphaka Florida
