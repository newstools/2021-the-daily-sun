AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy is determined to take the Durban-based outfit to the same level as that of his previous club, Cape Town City. McCarthy said with the players the club signed during the off season when Sandile Zungu took over the ownership of Usuthu last October, he can deliver more success than he did at City. Zungu flexed his muscles in the transfer market and signed players, among others; Makhehleni Makhaula, Thembela Sikhakhane, Limbikani Mzava, Siphelele Mthembu, Luvuyo Memela, Augustine Mulenga, Siphiwe Tshabalala, Xola Mlambo, Veli Mothwa and Phakamani Mahlambi. The Umlazi-born businessman’s mandate to his coaches is to see the club finish in the top four. McCarthy said he is aiming to do better than that and wants to compete with the big three. McCarthy’s tenure started on a positive note. Usuthu beat Chippa United 3-1 in a DStv Premiership match at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on 20 December. “I thought this post was super ideal for me with a chairman who is ambitious,” said McCarthy. “He wants to achieve things and he’s got to get the right people involved and who’s better than me to take his team forward, bring excitement to the Zulu Kingdom. “I want to put my own imprint on the team. You see the good job Cape Town City is doing now and I had a part to play in that and I think I can do exactly the same here and even more.” During his time at City from July 2017 until he was sacked in November last year, McCarthy took the club to fifth place and reached the MTN8 final in his first season. The following season, McCarthy went a step further when he led the Citizens to triumph in the MTN8 final and finished fourth in the league. “I’m pleased to be here and do my utmost best,” McCarthy added. AmaZulu will kick-off the New Year when they visit Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium on Sunday.
