COW EATS AND KILLS TEACHER! “I steamed three times a day and used eucalyptus oil, along with other home remedies. Within two weeks I was clear.” He was concerned the virus would affect his health in the long run. “I love running and I heard from people I spoke to that I wouldn’t be able to run as long as I used to,” he said. “They said it would leave my lungs damaged. “I’m taking it easy for now, but hopefully I’ll be able to get back to my normal life later.”
