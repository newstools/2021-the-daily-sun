RESIDENTS of Namahadi in the Free State are unhappy that their loved ones are not resting in peace. This is because graves at Dasklip cemetery are being destroyed by water. According to Namahadi Community Forum spokeswoman Thenjiwe Zapi, the community was not pleased. She said there were no proper processes for public participation during the land identification process. “People were told by councillors that the two cemeteries were identified. “We find this disturbing as burial sites are respected. We can’t have a situation where our people have sleepless nights because their loved ones are not safe,” said Zapi. In December, the municipality received a letter from African Church Leaders concerning the cemetery. “Graves are sinking. It seems the ground is too soft. “The place is watery, leading the graves to get bigger. There is no proper infrastructure and parking, and this might lead to accidents,” it read. Mafube Municipality acting municipal manager, Diao Ramabitsa, said they sourced the services of company Ecosphere and Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent, and a report was made available to the families of the dead, undertakers and pastors. “The cemetery will continue as a burial site, and the sandy area has been declared unsuitable for any burial,” he said.
