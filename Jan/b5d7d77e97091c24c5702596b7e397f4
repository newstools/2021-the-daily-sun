FAKE fleet fuel cards have landed two men in jail. The pair appeared in the Emalahleni District Court in Mpumalanga on Monday on a charge of fraud. Kenneth Maoto (35) and Reginaldo Nuvunga (34) were bust in Emalahleni by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team on Friday for alleged fraudulent transactions with counterfeit fleet fuel cards. According to Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, they were arrested by the Vaalbank Detective Services after presenting two counterfeit fleet cards for fuel payment at a local Puma garage. Investigations by the Hawks further linked them to additional similar fraudulent transactions. “They were consequently charged for at least two transactions that occurred at garages in Witbank in January 2021. They were arrested in court following their appearance for their earlier offence,” Sekgotodi said. She added that during the investigations, it was found that they had fraudulently created counterfeit fuel cards for the fleet under two different companies. The fraudulent transactions amount to just over R110 000. The case against the duo was postponed to 3 February 2021 for further investigation while they remain in custody.
