MOJA Love has done it again and introduced another controversial show.  This time, the channel will have a show for makhwaphenis. The channel, known for its controversial shows such as Uyajola 9/9, You Promised To Marry Me and No Excuse To Pay Pap Geld, is calling for people to write to their new show called Umakhwapheni. They released an advert on their social media platforms, calling people who are side dishes and want to confront their partners to write into the show for their chance to confront them. The new show will be hosted by comedian and actor, Mashabela Galane. Most people weren't happy about the new show. They were worried it would destroy people's marriages.
