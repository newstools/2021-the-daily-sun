FORMER North West Public Works MEC Mmule Maluleka has died. Her daughter Koketso said Maluleka died at her home in Mathibestad on Friday. “She died after a long illness. She died on the birth of the ANC to show us that she was a true leader,” she said. North West Legislature speaker Sussana Dantjie said at the time of her death, Maluleka was convinced she’d fully recover when she spoke to her two days before. “She showed no sign of illness. This is a tragic loss for the Legislature and nation as a whole,” she said. “Death has robbed the people of the North West and South Africa of a dedicated servant of the people who selflessly served her nation with distinction and loyalty.” Maluleka died while serving as a media liaison officer in Dantjie’s office. She previously worked as a member of the National Assembly, MEC for public works and chairwoman of the portfolio committee on public works. “She was an accomplished, committed and dedicated servant of the people with a very sharp mind who was ever ready to serve the people and her country,” said Dantjie. Maluleka will be buried in Mathibestad on Tuesday.
