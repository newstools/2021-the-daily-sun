The presiding officers of parliament say the 2021 State of the Nation Address will be held in a different style to ensure it complies with Covid-19 regulations. Speaker of National Assembly Thandi Modise and Amos Masondo, the chairman of the National Council of Provinces, said they are ready to host the president to deliver his Sona. The organisers of Sona have cut out some traditional events and ceremonies that usually accompany the event. Addressing media on Wednesday 27 January, Modise said: “There will be no red carpet and procession of the three arms of the state, or physical participation of junior and civil guard of honour, eminent persons, Imbongi, a military parade that leads the presidential procession onto a saluting dais on the steps of the National Assembly, the guard of honour by the National Ceremonial Guard and the 21-gun salute.” Modise said President Cyril Ramaphosa will be in parliament to deliver the Sona on 11 February at 7pm, but some MPs will be connected virtually. She said no more than 50 MPs, representatives from the judiciary and the executive should be in the physical chamber. The hybrid set up will be used again for the Sona debate that will take place on 16 and 17 February before Ramaphosa gives a response on 18 February. The presiding officers said the set up has enabled parliament to reduce some costs related to organising the Sona event. She said they had budgeted R2,2 million, but they were expecting to use less through the use of technology. “The significant savings expected will be redirected to modernising technological capabilities of parliament to enhance its constitutional functions of public participation, oversight and law-making. Due to the socio-economic hardships facing South Africans, parliament had over the years scaled down on the Sona and drastically cut its budget,” said Modise. The presiding officers said the theme for 2021 Sona is “Following up on our commitments: making your future work better”.
