HIS entire hand was chopped off by a maize mixer machine while on duty at Truda Foods in Komani, Eastern Cape on Tuesday, 19 January. Now the 28-year-old man faces an uncertain future. But Truda Foods COO Steve Edwards blamed negligence for the man’s injury. He said the man bypassed all safety protocol and measures by putting his hand in the part of the machine he wasn’t required to and instructed never to. “The machine in question has two power override switches which were both functioning properly. They were ignored and overridden,” he said. He said the factory paid the man’s private hospital costs.

Independent Komani Residents Association spokesman Zolile Xalisa said the company was constantly informed of unsafe and poor working conditions at the factory. He said 31 incidents happened last year. But Edwards said the 31 injuries applied to any minor or near incidents, as well as including incidents where no injury had occurred. He said about 1 000 staff members worked in shifts and the factory ran 24 hours a day, seven days a week. “By law, we keep a full account of any incident that happens, no matter how small.” KOROBELA LEFT ME SINGLE! But Xalisa said he knew how the man would respond and said: “Their response will always undermine us and shift the blame to the victim because they do not want to take full responsibility for what has happened.” South African Security and Allied Workers Union secretary Xolile Mashukuca said safety measures at the factory were not adhered to. “It was not difficult to predict they’ll deny these injuries were caused by poor health conditions at the factory.” The injured man could not be reached for comment.
