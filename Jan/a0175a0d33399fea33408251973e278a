SUPERSPORT United just doesn’t have the edge to go top of the Premiership standings. Amazulu are a team very much a work in progress. These are but two of the lessons the coaches, Kaitano Tembo and his AmaZulu counterpart, Benni McCarthy, would have sure learned after their team played out a 1-1 DStv Premiership draw at Lucas Moripe Stadium last night. For all their effort, Matsatsantsa lack consistency and that explains the reason they haven’t been able to mount a serious league title challenge. They continue to drop points at home, as seen with their performance yesterday, much to the annoyance of Tembo. McCarthy has all the right energy, commitment the willpower to deliver on Usuthu’s lofty ambitions. But the former Cape Town City coach still needs time for the players to fulfil his philosophy. Siphelele Mthembu rammed in low to give AmaZulu a narrow 1-0 interval advantage, but it could have been more goals from the visitors. Bradley Grobler levelled for United from a penalty spot, taking the penalty after Thamsanqa Gabuza was brought down… rather theatrically by Mario Booysen inside the box in the 75th minute. The equaliser somehow took the wind out of Usuthu’s sails, deflated by the equaliser which. And Grobler could have added the second minutes later, had he been clinical in his finishing. He sent a header narrowly wide, thus failing to snatch a late winner. At the heart of it, all was the unsung Makhehleni Makaula, the industrious midfielder patrolling midfield with class and quality, working effectively in the shadows. McCarthy praised valiant his players but added it is time they started taking responsibility.
