POLICE arrested a 43-year-old man on Thursday, 7 January, after he was found in possession of Ivermectin tablets, used to treat roundworm. The man was bust at King Shaka International Airport in Durban with the tablets, that some people have claimed can help treat Covid-19, despite there being no evidence. Colonel Athlenda Mathe said the tablets had a market value of R100 000. “The man, who had just arrived into the country from Dubai, was found with 2 464 tablets in his hand luggage,” said Mathe. He added that the police could confirm that the medicine was not registered with the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA). “According to SAHPRA, Ivermectin is neither indicated nor approved for use in humans. Furthermore, there is no confirmatory data on Ivermectin available as yet for its use in the management of Covid-19 infections,” Mathe said. The man had already appeared in the Verulam Magistrates Court, charged with possession of unregistered medicine and importation of medicines without a valid permit. “The case has been postponed to Friday, 8 January for a formal bail application,” Mathe added.
