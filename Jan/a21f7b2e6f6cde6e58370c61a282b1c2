MPUMALANGA education MEC Bonakele Majuba has confirmed it has extended the contracts of temporary teachers. Majuba said the contracts which expired on 31 December have been extended until 31 March. “This means that payment of their salaries will be accordingly processed for this January, and the subsequent two months thereafter. This contract extension is in keeping with the presentation made by the department in the Mpumalanga provincial education’s labour relations council chamber meeting of the 8 December,” said Majuba. This comes after thousands of temporary teachers and school assistants hired weren’t paid their December salaries. “No reasons were stipulated. But our permanent colleagues were paid yet we do the same job, They also did not work,” said one of the temporary teachers. Another teacher said: “So our argument is that when we seek for clarification, no one is willing to help us. It also takes the department the longest time to make us permanent. “The last group of teachers to be made permanent was during the year 2018 but since then, nothing has happened. “We are mistreated and taken advantaged of,” said the teacher.
