HAPPY nyaope junkies have found a new way to get a fix. They sell umhlonyane, believed to help cure colds and rumoured to help fight Covid-19. Business is booming! Businessminded addict Themba Mahlangu (32) from Moloto Village, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, told the SunTeam: “This is our way of making a living. “Instead of stealing to satisfy our addiction, we sell this plant. “We go to the bush to collect it and sell it for R20 a bundle. “On a good day I make about R300. I buy drugs and food.” Another 28-year-old junkie from Mandela Village, who didn’t want to be named, said it’s easy to prepare the plant. “You just boil it and drink the water or steam with it. “Now that the country is facing a second wave, we can make even more money,” he said. Resident Nomalanga Masango (44), a big umhlonyane fan, started using it during level 5. “Even though I used it, I still follow regulations to prevent the spread of the virus,” said the woman from Luthuli Village. But Senzo Masombuka (33) said there’s no proof the plant prevent Covid-19. “I don’t believe it. “People must just follow protocols to avoid getting the virus,” said Senzo. “These boys just want to make money and buy drugs.” Sangoma Feleng Magongwa from Dennilton said: “People should also go for testing if they have symptoms. “They must drink the herb whether they’re positive or not. “They should use the correct measurements and be careful not to overdose. “We also cook and sell it, and it can work wonders in defending us against the second wave.” Dr Bob-John Masango said the plant doesn’t treat the virus directly but helps to control it. “However, if people drink too much of it, they risk damaging their lungs. “It does treat the flu if used correctly andkeeps viruses at bay.”
