More than 1200 suspects have been arrested in Gauteng over
the second weekend of the new year during O Kae Molao operations. In a statement, Captain Mavela Masondo said, out of those
arrested 300 people were nabbed for violating the Disaster Management Act. "SAPS together with other law enforcement agencies in
the Province mounted static provincial roadblocks while working hard at
balancing crime prevention. "People of Gauteng should therefore expect more
roadblocks and stop-and-search operations," Masondo said. Meanwhile, more than 900 suspects were arrested in local
municipalities which include Ekurhuleni, Tshwane, Sebokeng and West Rand. "Suspects were arrested for various crimes such as
armed robbery, murder, driving while under the influence of alcohol and
possession of drugs. "Police visibility has been heightened at shopping
malls, bus terminals and taxi ranks to prevent robberies and other serious and
violent crimes," Masondo added. He said all the arrested suspects will appear before
different magistrate courts in Gauteng in due course.
