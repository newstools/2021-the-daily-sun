LERATO Mokoka was left traumatised after her son, who is almost two, was attacked by three dogs on Saturday, 16 January. Her toddler Bokamosa has been fighting for his life at George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, since almost being mauled to death by a pitbull and two mixed breed dogs. The 27-year-old mum from Kekana Gardens in Hammanskraal told Daily Sun the child was at the shops with a family friend when he was attacked. She said the friend put Bokamosa down to buy bread and moments later, the dogs pounced. “He told me the pitbull attacked first and sank its teeth into my baby’s neck. It was biting him over and over until the other dogs joined in,” she said. She said residents managed to chase the dogs away but her son was covered in blood. Luckily, a paramedic who had just knocked off work was passing by and came to the rescue. “An ambulance came and they rushed Bokamoso to Jubilee Hospital,” she said. Lerato said her child was transferred to George Mukhari because he had severe injuries and needed an operation. “My child is fighting for his life right now. The last time I saw him he was in a bad state. I pray he doesn’t die,” she said. “It breaks my heart that I can’t be with him now due to the Covid-19 outbreak, but nurses at the hospital are keeping me updated.” Lerato said she wanted the dogs to be taken away as the owners didn’t know how to take care of them. SPCA spokesman Dewald Wahlstrand advised Lerato to contact them so they could investigate the incident. Cops hadn’t responded to Daily Sun at the time of going to print.
