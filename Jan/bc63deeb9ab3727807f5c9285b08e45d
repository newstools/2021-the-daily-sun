However, he had complications two days before his death. We took him to the hospital where he unfortunately died in the early hours of Sunday morning,” he said. His memorial service was planned for Thursday, 21 January and he would be buried the following day. Both services would be held in Giyani, Limpopo. “Both the ceremonies will be attended by his close family members, but will be broadcast on Facebook and other social media platforms,” he said. Phephenyane was Munghana Lonene FM’s first ever station manager. His son Christian Phephenyane, who’s also the family spokesman, said his father had tested positive for Covid-19. “My father was unwell on Monday and he went to a general practitioner. He was told that there were issues with his kidneys. The doctor then recommended that he be taken to hospital immediately,” he said. “On Monday night, he was admitted to hospital. On Tuesday morning they said he had tested positive for Covid-19, then on Wednesday morning we were told he had died.” He said that his dad had been with Munghana Lonene FM for almost 27 years before he left 15 years ago. The funeral will be held this coming weekend, although the family hadn’t yet decided on the exact date.
