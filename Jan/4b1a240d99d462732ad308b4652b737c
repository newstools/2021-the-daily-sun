Mamelodi Sundowns will face off with Chippa United in a DStv Premiership match at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 3:30 pm CAT. Masandawana bounced back to winning ways in the league when they edged out Black Leopards 2-1 away on Wednesday - snapping their three-match drawing run. The win saw an unbeaten Sundowns side open a three-point lead at the top of the league standings, but joint second-placed SuperSport United and Swallows FC both have a game in hand. Peter Shalulile, the Sundowns striker, has warned that his best form is still yet to come after scoring a brace against Leopards. "When you are a man down you have to work extra hard, we kept on telling ourselves the draw is not good, we should start to win," Shalulile said. "We grind out the result today and we got the three points. Well, you have not seen the best of me yet, I'm still getting on my feet, I'm still learning and when the guys believe in you, you are destined for great things, that's why I'm delivering now." Meanwhile, Chippa have been revitalized as they extended their unbeaten run to three matches in the league when thrashed Leopards 3-0 away last weekend. As a result, the Chilli Boys are placed 11th on the league standings - three points behind eighth-placed Baroka FC, but the former have a game in hand. Ayanda Mtshali, the Chippa goalkeeper, believes that they now understand head coach Dan Malesela’s philosophy after their win over Leopards and he stressed the importance of scoring goals. “We went into the changing room and the coach told us that this is football, the more we create and we don’t score, they will score one goal and it would be difficult for us to come back," Mtshali said. "Usually we create chances but we don’t convert them. The coach gave us the push that we have to score as many goals as possible. We need to score to win games.” -SuperSport
