RHULANI Mokwena has fallen short of slamming Pitso Mosimane for unethical behaviour over the contentious Gaston Sirino transfer saga. The outspoken Mamelodi Sundowns co-coach has advised his master, Mosimane, to close the “Sirino chapter”, just as the club has moved on from the proposed transfer, which failed to materialise. For several months, Sirino was linked with a move to the Egyptian giants as he looked to reunite with former coach, Mosimane, who is now in charge at Al Ahly. Sundowns confirmed there were talks with Al Ahly but they fell through after the clubs failed to agree on a transfer fee. Mosimane drawn on the matter after his utterances that he understood how dejected Sirino must be feeling after the deal collapsed. However, Mokwena was not impressed by his former boss, seen as he expressed irritation over his comments. “The Gaston Sirino chapter must be closed. Even coach Pitso (Mosimane) must close the chapter because Sirino is a Mamelodi Sundowns player,” Mokwena told Power FM listeners. “He signed a four-year contract. He said to us that he is happy to stay and has committed himself to the club. “Just like we don’t speak about players from other teams, I think it is a little bit unethical to continue to have this talk about Gaston. The club has issued a statement on Sirino.” Mosimane is a fan of the diminutive South American attacker and explained Ahly’s overtures on Sirino. But not everyone is happy to read headlines about Sirino, not least Sundowns. “Of course, yes, there was interested from Al Ahly, but like any other club recruiting a player, including Mamelodi Sundowns, there is a responsibility to meet the demands of the other club in relation to the value of the player. “If that doesn’t happen, the deal falls through. It’s the business of football,” added Mokoena. “As this point in time, Gaston is fully committed to Sundowns.”
