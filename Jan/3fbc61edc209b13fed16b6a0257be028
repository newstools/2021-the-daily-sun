Zanele Ronoti (29) from Nyhunyhwini Squatter Camp in Philippi’s Browns Farm in Cape Town lost everything including her unborn baby’s clothes. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said she was taking a bath when she heard people screaming outside on Wednesday 13 January. “At first I thought they were attacking a thug. But I saw a big cloud of smoke, and that’s when my husband went out to see what was happening,” said Zanele. Her husband hurried back, saying they needed to run out before being burnt inside their shack. “I’m nine months pregnant. I can deliver my baby any time from now but my concern is that I don’t have clothes for him. They were all burnt in that fire,” she said. They couldn’t save any of their belongings because the fire was too strong. “We had to run for our lives. If we had tried to take clothes or anything, we were not going to make it out alive. It was so bad that one could swear it was vutha,” she said. Zanele has urged anyone who might have clothes for her baby to please assist her. “I was ready to welcome my child because I had everything but now I’m left with what I am wearing only. “I’m stressed because I am not working and my husband lost his job during the lockdown,” said Zanele. She said she usually sees people getting assisted after their stories are published by the People’s Paper and hopes the same will happen for her. Nandipha Ngunze (45) said they also lost all their belongings but Zanele needed help more than them. “Imagine buying clothes for your child and when it is time to deliver, this happens. Where she will get money to buy new clothes?” said Nandipha. “If we had the means we were going to assist her but we also lost our belongings. I pray that she gets help.” She alleged the fire was started by drug addicts who were smoking. “We last saw them before the fire. They ran away,” she said.
