CAPE Town City striker Mduduzi Mdantsane has warned his teammates to be careful when they face Black Leopards in their DStv Premiership clash at Thohoyandou Stadium this afternoon (5pm). Leopards’ confidence was boosted after their impressive 2-0 win over Soweto giants Orlando Pirates at the same venue at the weekend. Leopards victory over Bucs has helped them inch away from the relegation zone. They are third bottom with nine points, the same tally as Maritzburg United and Chippa United, who are above them on goal difference. Mdantsane reckons City need to be at their best if they are to upset Lidoda Duvha in Thohoyandou. “We watched the Leopards game against Pirates and we have seen that they can be dangerous when playing at home,” said the former Baroka captain. “It will be a tough game, but we are going there aware of what to expect. The good thing is that we played Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) recently and we know that stadium well. “Leopards are a tough side to beat at home, but we have to register our first win of 2021. The fact that they are playing to move from the relegation zone makes them a very difficult side to beat. But we are going there aiming for three points.” City are without a win in three consecutive league matches. They have lost two and drawn the other one. The 26-year-old has been a star player for coach Jan Olde Riekerink’s side this season. So far, Mdantsane has scored seven goals in 11 games to help City occupy sixth spot with 16 points. Mdantsane is only three goals behind current leading goalscorer and SuperSport United striker, Bradley Grobler. “It is not about me, but the team,” explained the Mpumalanga born star. “I will not be happy if I am scoring and the team is losing. I would love to continue with my scoring form, but what is important to me is to see the team doing well.” TODAY’S FIXTURES KICK-OFF: 5pm
