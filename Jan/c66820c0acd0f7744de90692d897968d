WORKING for free, especially during a pandemic, is very painful. This was what school patrollers, demanding their salaries from the Gauteng Education Department, told the SunTeam. They said more than 100 of them had not been paid. They said they started working at various schools in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, in June last year. Mpho Mashaba (30) told Daily Sun he was owed almost R6 400. “We couldn’t even buy food and clothes for our families over the festive season because there was no money,” he said. Mpho said they worked from 7am until 4pm on weekdays. “We have families to take care of and they’re starting to question why we work because we fail to provide for them.” Levi Bodiba (34) said he’d been waiting for his salary since July, but he continued reporting for work at Lebelo Primary School. Ruth Tsebe (40) said she was embarrassed to tell her family she had not been paid for over three months. “We’re appealing to the department to pay us. Life is very difficult during this time of Covid-19.” Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said they’d paid many patrollers, including youth brigades members and bus co-ordinators. “We’re paying them as service providers, what we call vendors in the payment process. We changed the payment system,” he said. Mabona said some payments might have been delayed during the data capturing process. “However, in December, we paid the majority of them. We have given details for the remainder to verify their banking details. There might be something wrong with their accounts,” he said. “Going forward, we should be in a position for payments to go smoothly. We explained the challenge to them when they visited our offices or called us. We’ll continue apologising and don’t see any challenges in the future.”
