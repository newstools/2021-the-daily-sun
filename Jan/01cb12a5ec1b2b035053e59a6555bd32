Carrying something on the head is a common practice in many parts of the world. This act provides an alternative to carrying a burden on the back, shoulders or hands. According to ancient history, people have carried burdens balanced on top of the heads usually to do daily work. Itâ€™s also sometimes used in religious ceremonies or as a feat of skill such with some dances. In the dance context, there are several traditional dances of West African cultures that include balancing an object on the head. Ritual dancing among worshippers of Shango, the god of thunder, sometimes balance a container of fire on their heads while dancing. Such extremes were also experienced during 2020 when South Africans would dance with a bottle of alcohol on their heads. This crazy and infectious act saw it trend across all social media platforms and become popular in dance music videos. Much like the Egbado group of the Yoruba tribe of Nigeria, this became a dance move that saw South Africans balance delicate alcohol bottles like terracotta figures.
