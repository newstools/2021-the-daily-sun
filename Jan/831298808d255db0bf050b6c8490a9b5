COPS bust two men in Langebaan in the Western Cape on Wednesday, 6 January. This while Police Minister Bheki Cele was conducting spot checks on beaches in the area as part of a two-day visit in the Southern Cape and West Coast areas after he received reports of people flouting lockdown regulations. Cele said the Southern Cape was short of cops, with over 800 in isolation, and they asked the army to help. “They will be coming tonight to work with our police because the police themselves have very reduced numbers. More than 300 have been infected around here, 800 of them are in isolation,” he said. Cele said people were complying with the laws, except the two men who were bust on Wednesday. COW KILLS AND EATS TEACHER! “Compliance was much better than the original report except in Langebaan, where there was some form of defiance from surfers. “What is irritating about those people is that they are foreign nationals from Europe. Their beaches are closed, but they come here to do a mess. We had to arrest them,” he said. Cele said he was happy boats and quad bikes were chasing people who are illegally going to the beach. According to Cele, he got a report that people in the area were “stubborn and arrogant and doing as they wished”. He said so far people were getting into the “groove”. “I would really love to be at the beach, but it’s not our choice that we are not on the beach, it is the situation. Everybody must behave. Wash your hands and sanitise,” said Cele.
