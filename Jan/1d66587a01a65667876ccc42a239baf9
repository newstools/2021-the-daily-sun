AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy says his side wasted a golden opportunity to beat struggling Kaizer Chiefs. The Soweto giants were headed into their clash with Usuthu already wobbly and on the ropes. Their league form left a lot to be desired as they ensure their worst start to a season in history. Even so, McCarthy’s Usuthu could not take advantage and add to AmaKhosi’s woes. They were beaten 1-0 by Chiefs thanks to Samir Nurkovic’s striker in the first half. McCarthy was disappointed by his side’s failure to capitalise on Chiefs’ shortcomings. "I am very disappointed I think there we had a tremendous opportunity for us to walk away with three points today,” McCarthy told SuperSport TV "Kaizer Chiefs bounced in a good way, they are giants and when you are playing giants whether they are on top form or nor you have to be clinical. "Teams like this (Chiefs) need one chance to punish you and that is exactly what happened. I am very happy with the performance, the way we pushed them all the way searching for that equaliser. "But we going to continue to work because there are so many positives. We just have to work on scoring goals."
