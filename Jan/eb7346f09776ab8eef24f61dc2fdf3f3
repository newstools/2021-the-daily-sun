THE wearing of masks in public places has become one of the biggest significant tools in curbing the spread of Covid-19. It has come to my attention that people don’t wash hands or sanitise regularly. And they tend to wear filthy masks on a daily basis. A dirty mask is as good as not wearing one because its hazardous to your health. We should wear masks properly to protect both ourselves and others against the transmission of Covid-19. Remember that we breathe in fresh oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Not all the carbon dioxide is able to escape the walls of a dirty mask. There is no way you can avoid touching your mask with even the dirtiest hands. By breathing in the dirty particles, we’re promoting breeding ground for other bacteria to enter our lungs. Can we please wash those cloth masks on a daily basis. Additionally, if you use a surgical mask, please don’t wear it again the the following day. Witbank
