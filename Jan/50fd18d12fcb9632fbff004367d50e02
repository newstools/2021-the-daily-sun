THOUSANDS of residents braved the cold weather to queue outside their municipal offices on Friday, 29 January to raise their grievances over high water and power rates. The people from Buffalo City, Eastern Cape, said those who couldn’t pay had their electricity cut off. Affected areas include Mdantsane, Duncan Village, Scenery Park, Braelyn, Dimbaza, Zwelitsha and Ginsberg. They also collected 4 000 signatures for a petition they said would be handed to the municipality’s petition committee. Mdantsane community leader Avuyike Kobo told Daily Sun it was strange that their rates were so high as no officials had checked their meters since lockdown started in March last year. “We have received abnormal bills. Even residents who are indigents are affected. The municipality does not value us. They think they can just switch off the electricity whenever they feel like it,” he said. Resident Martin Mlungwana said he had received bills for more than R20 000. “I’ve been living in the dark for a week because my power was cut off. When I visit their offices, I am given the runaround.” The petition demanded that Mayor Xola Pakati respond to residents’ grievances by no later than Friday, 5 February. It said if this didn’t happen, residents would be forced to take to the streets. Municipal spokeswoman Bathandwa Diamond told the SunTeam her office had not yet received the petition. “In the past, we received petitions from ward 46 with account numbers and those were dealt with as an individual issue. “Massive petitions go through a process where a committee deals with them. It’s a democratic right to petition, however, it becomes very important to note that accounts are handled individually,” she said.
