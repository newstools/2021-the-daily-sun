Traffic cops in Krugersdorp arrested
three suspects in two separate incidents who were found with a large sum of
money during a joint Okae Molao operation in the West Rand on Thursday. Gauteng Traffic Police Spokesperson Sello
Maremane said the arrests were directly linked to money laundering incidents
that happened this morning during a random stop and search operation conducted
on the R41 road. “In the first incident, a(46) man who was
a passenger in a white Nyathi Taxi was arrested after being found carrying cash
amounting to R34 430,00 suspiciously. “The suspect could not give a clear
explanation as to why he was carrying the cash thus failed to account,”
Maremane said in a statement. In another incident, Maremane said two
men aged between 48 and 54 were found carrying cash amounting to R112,000.00
which they could not account for. “The total cash confiscated by the police
amounts to R146 430.00. The above suspects were arrested for money laundering
and are currently detained at Kagiso police station,” he added. Maramane said the suspects were expected
to appear at the Kagiso Magistrates Court in due course to face charges
relating to money laundering. Meanwhile, Gauteng Provincial
Commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela said they would continue their
operations every Thursday to ensure that wanted suspects are successfully
tracked and apprehended.
