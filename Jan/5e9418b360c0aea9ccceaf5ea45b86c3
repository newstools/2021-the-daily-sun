SURROUNDED by family and friends, gogo Nyatshavhungwa Mudzanani-Nangammbi celebrated her 100th birthday on 1 January. The celebration adhered to lockdown regulations and was held in Duvhuledza Village near Mubumoni, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo. Gogo Nyatshavhungwa said although she walks with a walking stick, she’s still strong and hoping to celebrate more birthdays. She said she was still alive because of the will of God. “I can still speak well, eat and see. I enjoy eating mashonzha (mopane worms), vegetables and fruit. “I don’t eat food cooked with fat and don’t drink alcohol. “I used to walk from village to village as there was no public transport like today. “We ploughed mealie fields and used old methods to grind mealies.” One of gogo’s kids, Mpfunzeni, said gogo raised them under difficult conditions but taught them good morals and encouraged them to take education seriously. Mpfunzeni, a principal at Khubvi Primary School, said he was born in a poor but strict family. “My mother used to brew traditional beer, mahafhe, and paid our school fees with the little money she made. “When I started school my father and mother didn’t work but depended on subsistence farming. When I went to college, the main source of funds was their old age grants. “I was lucky to fund college fees as they were cheap. All you needed was hard work and determination.”
