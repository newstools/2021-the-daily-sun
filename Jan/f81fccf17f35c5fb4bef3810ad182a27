TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila coach Joel Masutha has admitted that there’s immense pressure mounting on them. The Vhembe district-based club has not done well since the beginning of the DStv Premiership and now they found themselves second from the bottom of league table. TTM have only accumulated nine points in 11 league games and are one point ahead of TS Galaxy who are languishing at foot of the table. On Tuesday afternoon, Tshakhuma will be hoping to upset Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs who are slowly gaining momentum having had a terrible start to the 2020-21 Premiership campaign. The match will take place FNB Stadium at 5pm. A win for Chiefs will see them winning their third league match in a row, while a win for Tshakhuma will see them move into the top 10 with 12 points. Masutha has predicted a tough clash, but vows to fight tooth and nail to overcome Amakhosi. Masutha said: “The match against Kaizer Chiefs is going to be a very crucial for us. “Looking at the position we are in, we have not done well at all this year and the pressure is mounting. We need to show up against Chiefs, I was happy with the commitment and performance of the boys against Golden Arrows especially when we were down to 10 man against 11. I think we showed a lot of fight, a lot of will to get the result, unfortunately we did not get it.” He continued: “We have to do it the hard way against rejuvenated Chiefs who have won two games in a row against difficult opponents. We are going to field the strongest team that we have ever played this year. “I think the team is more balanced and tactically we will also be balanced, offensive we will be stronger than in the past games. We feel that we have a strong chance of getting a result against Chiefs.”
