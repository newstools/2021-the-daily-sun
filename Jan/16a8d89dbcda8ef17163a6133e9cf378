Eastern Cape NPA spokesman Luxolo Tyali confirmed that four of the five Walter Sisulu University students who allegedly killed medical student Lwando Mantshontsho were found guilty by the Mthatha High Court. According to Tyali the four –Siphesihle Mafungwa, Yamkela Mxokozeli, Philani Daca and Lwakhe Matakane –were all found guilty on one count of murder, two counts of attempted murder, a count of house breaking and one of malicious damage to property. Mantshontsho, a final year student at the university’s Nelson Mandela Drive campus, was stabbed to death in 2017 after allegedly attending a party. His body was found in pool of blood in his room at Atlanta residence. Mantshontsho, who was originally from Cofimvaba, was found with multiple stab wounds in his upper body. His murder shocked the entire country as people questioned the safety of students staying on campus. Tyali said the fifth accused, Sandile Khango, was only convicted on one count of malicious damage to property. Tyali said: “The four were convicted last week and sentencing procedures are to commence on 19 February.”
