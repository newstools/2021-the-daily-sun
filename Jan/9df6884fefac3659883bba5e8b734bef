THE Mpumalanga Hawks have arrested two suspects aged 17 and 34 for illegally operating a gold refinery laboratory on a farm at Sundra Property on Friday 15 January. According to Hawks spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi, a multi-disciplinary team responded to information received by the Sundra police about a truck that was driving along the neighbouring farms without headlights on. “Upon police arrival at the identified address, the suspects fled the scene and the police gave chase. This resulted in the arrest of two suspects. “A search was later conducted at the premises, which led to the discovery of two illegal refinery laboratories operating on the farm where a group of illegal miners were employed to illegally process the gold.”  Sekgotodi said three phendukas were found in each refinery. “The phendukas were electrically operated and gold bearing materials were also found and confiscated for further investigation. The arrested suspects are expected to appear before the Sundra Magistrates Court on Monday 18 January,” said Sekgotodi.
