AFTER Tshwane readers told the People’s Paper about their disgust at the condition of cemeteries, city workers began clearing the bushes. Daily Sun published an article on Tuesday, 5 January about the horrible state of cemeteries in the city. Residents, who’d gone to their their loved ones’ graves to perform rituals, said cemeteries resembled game farms! At Zandfontein Cemetery, north of Tshwane, tall grass hid even the tallest tombstones. The Rebecca Street and Atteridgeville cemeteries looked as if they were in the bush, with driveways covered in tall grass and small trees.  Mapadi Kgomo (50) of Lotus Gardens said she didn’t like it that stories had to be published before the city could do its job. “We expect the city to deliver services because we pay for them,” Mapadi told the People’s Paper. “It’s not a favour. They’re obligated to clean graveyards. “The roots of trees have made cracks in tombstones, while others have been knocked over by falling branches. “It’s raining and grass and trees are growing, but the city doesn’t seem to know this. “Maybe they focus on the rich parts of city such as Garsfontein.” Resident Kgomotso Senyatsi of Atteridgeville (38) was happy that she could now visit her dear gogo’s grave. “My gogo was well liked ekasi because of her good heart,” she said. “I missed her on Christmas, but when I went to Atteridgeville Cemetery to visit her I turned back after seeing a rabbit. “Thanks to Daily Sun, I’ll now go visit my gogo.”
