With no booze allowed to be sold, residents from Mau Mau in Nyanga now just sit around a five-litre of cold drink mix. They buy the powdered drink mix sachets which they dilute with water and put in the fridge overnight. “We have nothing to drink, we cannot drink water all day so we just decide to drink some cold drink while we are chilling on a weekend, ”said Johannes Rataza (51).The residents told Daily Sun that they used to have booze in their fridges but it ran out within a week after Ramaphosa banned booze. The group of residents said though they are in a group they fear Covid-19 and always wear their masks and maintain social distance. They said their new discovery saves money because when they drink booze they spend around R300 per weekend but with drink mix, they spend only R10. “I cannot be indoors the whole day because I stay alone, I do not even have a TV to keep me entertained. That is why we end up sitting outside just to chit chat. We normally do this with some booze but now we all ran out of stock, so we opted to buy a few cold drinks for ourselves,” added Rataza. The group takes turns to buy the drink mix, to prepare and put it in the fridge overnight. They only need R10 to buy sachets that will be enough for the whole weekend. One sachet costs between R1 and R2. Madala Monwabisi Dondolo (65) said he never thought he would sit down and drink several glasses of cold drink instead of booze. “We are now like school kids who always drink juice at school. I drink booze every  weekend which my son buys for me but now he cannot do so. I hope when Ramaphosa addresses the nation again he will at least allow people to buy and drink booze while they are at their homes. He may keep bars and shebeens closed so that people don't gather, but at least he must allow booze to be sold for home consumption,” Dondolo said.
