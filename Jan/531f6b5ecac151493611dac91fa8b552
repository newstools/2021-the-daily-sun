It came as a shock to us because she was okay,” he said. Dumisani described his sister as a warm and loving person. “She was very loving and a warm person who was down to earth. She’d always relate to people and whenever she was around people, she wouldn’t behave like a superstar that she was. I loved how she would speak her mind now and then, but only when she needed to.” He said she was shooting with Gomora during the festive season, but her episodes have not been aired.
