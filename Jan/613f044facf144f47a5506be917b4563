PERCY Tau is confident Brighton Hove and Albion can take points against Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday after being impressed by the performance at the Etihad on Wednesday when they went down 1-0 to Manchester City. Making his first start and Premier League debut for the club, Tau gave Albion a good outlet down the flank and at one stage left Oleksandr Zinchenko on his backside with a neat piece of skill. Tau said: "It was a difficult game, but we did our best. We tried to create chances, but it was difficult to do that. We have to grow from this. “We want to try and create more chances to score – you want those big chances in games, but we didn't make many of them against Manchester City. “We can take positives out of this though and try and do better on Saturday. It was a good game, we did well and it can only get better, it will only be a matter of time before we starting getting those wins.” The game was Tau's second in an Albion shirt after he came on as a substitute against Newport County on Sunday. The 27-year-old is certain that he will continue to improve the more he becomes accustomed to playing with his new teammates. “I need to adjust to the team and the league. With time I will get better as I understand the way the coach wants me to play more.”
