PARENTS from a school in Doorfontein, Joburg, are concerned about their kids returning to school. This is despite schools remaining closed until next month. A parent said his two kids told him their school opened on Monday, 18 January. “I told them all schools, including private ones, are closed. They told me their teachers said they must come to school without their uniform,” said the worried parent. He said his concern was that kids were being trafficked and they won’t be identifiable should anything go wrong. “Who’s going to take accountability should anything go wrong? Why do they think they can break the rules? I’m angry because it means they don’t care if our kids get sick. All they are interested in is money,” said the parent. He pleaded with the Department of Basic Education to take steps against the school. “They can’t be above the law. My kids insist they want to go to school because they will miss out. They’re worried other kids are going and they aren’t. They should be stopped and resume with schools when government gives the go ahead,” he said. Education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “The details of the school are known to us. We will secretly visit the school to check for compliance.” Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said they couldn’t charge the school. “It’s not a criminal offence on our side. The department will have to take steps gainst the school and possibly shut it down.”
