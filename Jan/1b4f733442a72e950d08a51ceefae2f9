THE Eastern Cape Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa has learnt with shock of the brutal killings of three initiates in Jojweni in Tsomo. The three initiates, from the ages of 19 and 20, were found dead by young boys who’d brought food to the initiation school on Saturday, 2 December. Their bodies had gunshot wounds. The congress’ Eastern Cape chairman, Inkosi Mwelo Nonkonyana, urged community members to work hand in hand with police to help bring those responsible to book. “The other thing we’d like to say is that, as traditional leaders, we’re astonished these initiates were not with amakhankatha (initiation school teachers/assistants). We have said in the past amakhankatha must be with initiates with 24/7,” said Nonkonyana. “We’re also calling on traditional leaders to investigate this matter further to see whether our customs and regulations haven’t been disturbed, but we’re conveying our condolences to the families. “We hope whatever is going to emerge from these investigations will give them closure,” he said. According to provincial traditional affairs spokesman Mamkeli Ngam, two of the initiates are 20 years old while one of them is 19. “At this moment police are still investigating the reason behind the gruesome murders.” Traditional Affairs MEC Xolile Nqatha sent a message of condolences to the initiates’ families. This brings the number of initiates who’ve died this season to 10.
