PEOPLE who exhume bodies of loved ones who died from Covid-19 have been warned! Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane told Daily Sun recently: “There are laws that must be followed if you want to exhume a body. “If the reports circulating on social media are true, we’re calling on people to refrain from doing that and come forward.” Mabuyane was responding to rumours families were exhuming loved ones’ remains to remove the leakproof plastic body bag. Apparently, they believe this suffocates the corpses. The families claim to have had nighmares their dead loved ones were complaining about the body bags. Mabuyane doesn’t buy this. He urged people to comply with rules aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. He warned the exhumations would lead to more Covid-19 infections. According to social media rumours, such incidents happened in Ngcobo. Mabuyane said over 7 000 people had died in the province so far.
