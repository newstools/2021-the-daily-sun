Life coaches often encourage people to have regular meetings with themselves. This includes having a deep self-introspection and more often than not, having a good talking-to with yourself. This act has often been deemed crazy and unusual by people, but according to experts talking aloud to yourself is a sign of intelligence. According to scientists at the Bangor University, speaking out loud to yourself was found to be a trait of higher cognitive function. During the course of the study conducted by the university, 28 participants were given instructions in which they were asked to either read out loud or quietly to themselves. It was found that the participants who read the instructions out loud were more focused and performed the task more efficiently than the ones who read quietly to themselves. Psychologist and author, Dr Paloma Mari-Beffa concludes that the benefits of talking to yourself may come from simply hearing oneself. He further explains that those who talk to themselves tend to achieve more in life.
