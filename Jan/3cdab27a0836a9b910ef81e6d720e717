KAIZER Chiefs defender Daniel Cardoso has been encouraged by their last performance against AmaZulu and believes they have finally turned the corner. Amakhosi eased some pressure on their coach Gavin Hunt with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Usuthu on Wednesday. The Glamour Boys had been undergoing a tough period before that result and they were sitting in an unfamiliar position in the relegation zone. They have had a tough start to the season, their worst in the club’s history. But Cardoso is convinced that is behind them now and better days have arrived. He wants to see the same amount of commitment and fighting spirit in their next match against Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday (5 pm).“It’s another very tough game,” said Cardoso. “It’s not going to be an easy one, we have to collect three points. We have been really good on the road and we hope to continue the performance. “If we can put up another fighting performance as we did against AmaZulu then we should walk away victorious. “That’s what will boost us in the next game in Cape Town, obviously playing back-to-back we have to get our recovery right.” Cardoso thanked the club’s faithful supporters for their unwavering support during tough times. “We hope to get another win for our supporters and thank them for sticking with us and supporting us even when the times were tough,” added Cardoso. “We will come out of what we have been going through, it is just a phase.”
