A MAN (50) who spent Christmas behind bars for allegedly raping a minor briefly appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court on Thursday 21 January. He was expected to make his formal bail application, but his lawyer Advocate Makhosonke Mashego told the court there’s certain information that needed to be verified with him. No protesters were outside the court to support the victim’s family. The victim’s aunt (27) told Daily Sun the accused lured the girl with snacks and raped her at a local valley in Welverdiend Village in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. “The little girl was crying saying she has been raped by him. After he lured her with snacks, he dragged her down the valley in broad daylight before raping her. When finished, he threatened to finish her off if she told anyone. Doctors confirmed she was raped. So he must go and rot in jail,” said the aunt. Welverdiend Community Development Forum secretary Fortune Ndlovu said: “Residents are angry with him. They also handed over a petition to this court opposing his bail. “We believe that should the court grant him bail, there’s a likelihood that such a decision could cause the community to lose confidence in the criminal justice system and ultimately react in anger which could put the life of the accused at risk.” Magistrate Robert Mokone postponed the matter to Monday, 25 January for a formal bail application.
