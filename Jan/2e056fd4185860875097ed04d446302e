FOUR suspects who posed as cops have been arrested for house robbery. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said four armed men went to a house in Lynnville, Emalahleni where they allegedly disguised themselves as police officers. They robbed the victims of their belongings as well as cash. “They went to another house where they found a male victim and his family. It is said the suspects wore police reflector jackets and posed as police members. They forced the door open where they robbed them of their personal belongings as well as cash before fleeing in a Ford Fiesta belonging to one of the suspect’s father, who has passed away.” Mdhluli said the suspects allegedly also broke into another house in Lynnville where the occupants were not home at the time and took items including a cell phone and DVDs. “The police were notified about and cases of house robbery as well as house breaking were opened. A manhunt was launched that led to the arrest of the four suspects. During the arrest, the members confiscated the getaway vehicle,” he said. Police also recovered a toy gun, DVDs, a police reflector jacket as well as a reflector jacket which belongs to a security company. The police believe the items may have been stolen during the robberies. “They’re expected to appear at Emalahleni Magistrate’s Court soon on charges of house robberies and other related charges committed on 29 December in Emalahleni and surrounding areas.”
