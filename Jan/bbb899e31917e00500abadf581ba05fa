THE family of Misheck Mgiba is struggling to understand the cause of their son’s mystery death. Misheck, from Merry Pebble Stream Village outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, was last seen with his friends doing laundry. Later in the evening of Wednesday, 6 January, one of his friends came running to tell the family that he had collapsed and died. His sister-in-law gogo Sophie Masiya told Daily Sun that they saw Misheck in the afternoon walking around with his friend and doing laundry. “But then we were told he had collapsed. We rushed to him outside his house. When we arrived, we called out his name to check if he was okay, but he didn’t respond. We took him to his room to cool him down because it was very hot, but he was already dead,” she said. The death had left the family with many questions. “We didn’t expect him to leave us like this. We’re in pain because there was nothing to indicate that he was ill before. We have to place our trust in God,” gogo Sophie added. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said cops and paramedics were notified about the incident. On arrival at the scene, they found a man inside his house. He was certified dead, and police have opened an inquest docket.
