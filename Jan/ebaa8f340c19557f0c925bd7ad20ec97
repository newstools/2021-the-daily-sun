IT’S no longer business as usual when it comes to funerals. This is because of the high number of people dying from Covid-19. With more people dying, grave diggers and closers now find themselves under pressure. Pitso Maleka, owner of PM Grave Closure, told Daily Sun they now had more work, but in a limited amount of time. He said he had to hire more guys and ensure they did not get sick. “We were usually busy from Thursday, but we are now busy from Monday to Monday. We can have about 20 funerals in a day in different kasis,” he said. Pitso said municipalities even asked them to dig graves as well.  “My teams now have to start working as early as 4.30am to dig graves. “When it’s a Covid-19 funeral, I have to make sure they are wearing PPEs. They have to drink vitamins and get sanitised thrice,” said Pitso. He said he was working at a loss. “I spend most of the money making sure my teams are well equipped and their health is taken care of,” he said. Pitso said some families buried their loved ones on the day they died. “It’s really tough because they might find there’s a shortage of coffins. So it now becomes a matter of as long as the body is buried,” said Pitso. He said although he’s running at a loss, the country faced a bigger problem.  “We are doomed if we don’t help each other during this difficult time. Everyone needs to play an active role to fight this pandemic. It’s a time to be selfless and be more understanding. Some families don’t even have money for burials, so we have to help where we can.”
