 A 54-year-old ANC councillor was arrested for drunken driving. ANC Caucus spokesperson Fiona Abrahams told Daily Sun that the ANC caucus in the City of Cape Town is shocked about the arrest of one of its councillors on New Year’s Eve. “It is alleged that the councillor was arrested for being under the influence of alcohol while driving", said Abrahams. She said as the ANC they take the matter very seriously and believe that the law must take its course and the person brought it to book. "We also believe that the law applies to everyone irrespective of the position you hold in society." Fiona said they will escalate the matter to the ANC REC for further investigation and possible disciplinary action against the councillor concerned. Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the arrest to Daily Sun, he revealed that a 54-year-old man was detained at Bothasig police station on 01 January 2021, after he was arrested for driving his vehicle under the influence of alcohol. “The identity of the person cannot be disclosed until his court appearance”, said Traut. Sinazo Ngalwana a 39-year-old resident said government people are the ones who always break the law. “They like doing that and the worst thing is that nothing will happen to him, they undermined the law and the president”, said Ngalwana. Another resident said until harsh decisions are taken against these officials, nothing will change. “They are supposed to set a good example, but they are doing the opposite of that, he won't be respected by the people he leads because he is a leader that doesn't respect the law", added the resident. Lindile Ncanywa a 30-year-old man said the only people that pay the price when they are caught breaking the law are normal citizens. “He drinks and drives because he knew that nothing would happen to him, our law always fails and it will even now”, added Ncanywa.
