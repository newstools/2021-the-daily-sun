I have noted with shock that a number of kids are being trained as izangoma in recent years. This kind of training has never occurred in previous years. How do you train a six-year-old to be a sangoma? I see this as child abuse, not real sangoma training. A sangoma trainee in the previous years was someone who was much older. They would normally have been shown through some dream and actions before deciding to thwasa. What has a kid seen in life to qualify to be a sangoma? Some gobelas are just happy to make money. This is one of the reasons why some izangoma end up losing respect. Katlehong
