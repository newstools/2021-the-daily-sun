THEY may be stuttering at home, but Kaizer Chiefs seem to be on to something good in the Caf Champions League. Yes, their African Safari is only just beginning as they have only reached the group stages. But Khama Billiat believes they can draw much more than the 1-0 victory against De Agosto in Angola on Tuesday. “The win really gives us confidence going back to the domestic competitions,” said Billiat. Amakhosi host Maritzburg United at FNB Stadium on Saturday (5pm), facing their ex-coach Ernst Middendorp, who is now with the Blue Army. “We really want to go all the way, to push ourselves to the limit and see how far we can go, competing in Africa,” Billiat said. Like his teammates, Billiat has come under fire as Amakhosi fumble from one poor result to another in the league. Amakhosi reached the Champions League group stages for their first time in their history, thanks to Leonardo Castro’s goal. But that is not the end. “We want to be the generation that not only qualifies for the group stages but that goes all the way,” Billiat added. “This club has a very good history. We want to make our chairman proud. “With the efforts the chairman is putting in the team, it’s really important for us to do well, to test ourselves against the rest of the Champions League giants. “It’s a great feeling. We’d like to thank God for reaching the group stages...coming here with a charter, we appreciate it.” The goalscoring problems have continued to afflict the Glamour Boys. But it is a totally different ball game on the continent as games are not only won on performance, but experience. “Worked hard, stuck to the plan and got the result,” added Billiat. “It’s going to be very tough but we are learning to grow and gelling as a team. Normally the coach is on my case, saying my strength is running behind the defenders. I did as told and as Njabulo Blom put me through on the goal, eliminated two defenders to find Castro who scored the goal.”
