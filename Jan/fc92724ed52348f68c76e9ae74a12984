RESIDENTS of Brown’s Farm in Philippi, Cape Town, have applauded the Leap officers who nabbed a 14-year-old boy for being in possession of a fake gun. The officers had been observing the boy, who immediately fled the scene when he saw the officers. He was caught and officers found a firearm without a magazine in his pants. Resident Nomvuyo Mamane (43) said they are tired of being terrorised by kids. “We are glad they are getting arrested but the bad thing is that they come back and do the same crime over again,” Nomvuyo. She said sometimes residents get robbed with fake guns. “We cannot be so sure they’re imitation guns because some thugs also have real guns. Instead of fighting, we just give them what they want,” she said. She told Daily Sun that even Uber drivers are being robbed by these young boys. Another resident said the crime in the kasi will never end because residents hide criminals. “We all know kids who are robbing Uber drivers. When these drivers stopped coming to our area, they started robbing us and even Avanzas. We need to become honest and help cops fight this,” said the resident. Nyanga police spokeswoman Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi confirmed the arrest, saying the 14-year-old was arrested with an imitation gun.
