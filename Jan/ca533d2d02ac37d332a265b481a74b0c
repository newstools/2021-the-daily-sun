South Africa breached the 30 000 mark for Covid-19-related deaths on Monday.  The
 Department of Health reported that, with another 434 deaths reported, 
30 011 lives have been lost as a result of illness associated with the 
virus.  Amid
 talk of a vaccine that could only be available by April, the toll 
continues, with two people people reported to have died in the Free 
State, 36 in Gauteng, 71 in KwaZulu-Natal, seven in Limpopo, 24 in the 
North West and three in the Northern Cape. The positivity rate is at 33.7%. A
 total of 1 113 349 cases have been recorded, and 911 573 people have 
recovered. This is a recovery rate of 81.9%, which has slipped again 
from 82%. The country is in a Level 3 lockdown, which is expected 
to be reviewed by 15 January. This means the traditional holiday 
festivities were mostly put on hold and beaches were closed. It also 
became compulsory to wear a mask in public as the country deals with a 
second surge, with the added complication of a new variant.
