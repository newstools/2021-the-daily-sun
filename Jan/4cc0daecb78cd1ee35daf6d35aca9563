A Cape Town man was bust for selling canned fish meant for school children feeding schemes. The Western Cape Department of Education said it received a tip-off from a member of the public about a shop that was selling pilchards meant for school children. MEC Debbie Schafer said they then reported the matter to the police, who swiftly arrested the suspect. “Yesterday I was informed by a member of the public that canned pilchards, specifically packaged for use in the National School Nutrition Programme (NSNP), were being sold in a shop in Retreat. The cans clearly state that they are packaged specifically for use in the NSNP, and not for resale. They are exclusively for use in our schools, and can only have ended up in the shop by criminal means. We immediately reported this to the SAPS,” said Schafer. She applauded cops for their quick response to the arrest. “I am pleased to report that the SAPS has already made an arrest and recovered 18 cans. I commend the police for their swift action and thank the member of the public for reporting this. I will follow the investigation with great interest to see how it came to be that goods destined for the NSNP ended up in private hands,” she added. Schafer said the arrest would serve as a deterrent to those who steal from schools. “The NSNP is a vital lifeline for our most vulnerable learners. To steal the food is to steal directly from the mouths of children, and it will not be tolerated,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident. “This office can confirm that a 31-year-old man was arrested for the possession of the presumed stolen property at 11.40am yesterday, 21 January. It is alleged that the suspect was found in possession of food items that belonged to a feeding scheme. The suspect is due to appear in the Wynberg Magistrates Court today,” said Van Wyk.
