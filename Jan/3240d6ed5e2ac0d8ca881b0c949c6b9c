He wants nothing to do with them.” But according to TMZ, the couple are receiving marriage counselling. For half of 2020, their marriage was in trouble as the subject of divorce was looming. “We were told Kim was ready to pull the plug on the marriage at some point, but it was when Kanye was going through a serious bipolar episode and he felt it was cruel for her to do it when he was unwell,” TMZ reported. “But no final decision has been made and it’s telling that they’ve been in counselling for a while. “Their issues are neither contentious nor ugly, but they have a lot of differences, from lifestyle to politics. They are, however, fully aligned on parenting.”
