IT’S another Phuza Thursday and the alcohol taps remain closed. While sadness and disappointment continue to brew, many people have taken this time to stay healthy. According to nutritionists, there are certain foods that help keep alcohol cravings in check. Here are some foods that can help keep the booze-cravings away: 1. Fruit Fruit are extremely healthy, to begin with, and the added benefit is that they contain high amounts of water, which will dilute the alcohol. 2. Eggs We say eggs because of the high amount of protein they carry. Basically, any food that is rich in protein will work as it slows alcohol absorption and keeps you feeling full for a long time. 3. Nuts There’s a reason bars serve peanuts with alcohol. Not only do they taste good, but they also have high amounts of fat which are helpful in slowing the absorption of alcohol.
