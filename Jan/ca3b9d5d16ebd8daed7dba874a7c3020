A FACEBOOK post about a modernised indumba had izangoma up in arms recently. Posted by Sangoma Festival, the caption read: “We need to do away with dusty indumba full of mayonnaise bottles.” He posted images of luxury rooms with lavish furniture he suggests should replace the traditional indumba. Lots of izangoma didn’t like the post. Sangoma Festival said: “There are no patterns in this post because such izindumba don’t exist. This post is to spark some thought. How do our ancestors go from creating pyramids and varsities with great architecture to a dusty indumba full of mayonnaise bottles? Today’s izangoma block innovation. “It’s your fault, guys. Then you turn around and blame it on idlozi. Our ancestors used to carve gold with their bare hands. “You want to tell me your ancestors don’t want a sangoma to advertise or talk about yourself and what you do? You’re lying.” Romeo Malepe, the face behind the post, said healers must rebrand. The interior designer didn’t want fellow izangoma to be boxed into thinking it’s okay to store muthi in mayonnaise bottles. Some people agreed with him.
