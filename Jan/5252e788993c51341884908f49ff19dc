A SLAY queen is at your service and is just one phone call away. Refiloe Jawa (26) from Port Elizabeth has a cleaning service business, Slay Queen Holdings. It breaks norms as to what a woman, maid or cleaner should look like and changes the image of what is seen as the typical slay queen. “I saw the gap in the market and I wanted to do something different, daring and jaw dropping,” said Refiloe. She hoped this would encourage other young ladies to get up and hustle. “I’ve had some challenges from men whose intentions are not always based on the services my business offers,” she said. “They take chances, but I’m not about to let them stop me from doing my work.” She’s too focused to let anything come between her and making money. Refiloe wants to expand Slay Queen Services and employ more women. “I’m all about empowering other women, and no man can take advantage of us,” she said. She said her plan is to expand nationwide. She told the People’s Paper she’s single and not looking for love. “Right now I just want to focus on my business and making more money. We’ll see about the rest later,” she said. She said she does a standard two-bedroom flat including laundry, windows, dishes for R450. Daily Sun spoke to people who’ve used Refiloe’s services. Mandla Sibeko (39) said that even though keeping focused is hard in the presence of Refiloe, she’s very professional. “She knows what her job entails and you won’t have to worry about her doing half jobs,” he said. Mbalenhle Mthimunye (33) said she’s a busy woman, and when she saw Refiloe’s post she didn’t hesitate to call her. “I’ve never seen such an enthusiastic cleaner,” said Mbalenhle. “She’s great at her job. I hope she expands her business.”
