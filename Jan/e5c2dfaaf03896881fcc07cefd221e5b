MANY of his colleagues, fellow ministers and journalists remembered late Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu as a hardworking and respectful communicator. People on social media also walked down memory lane as they remembered the many moments the minister, who was human like everybody else, left the country in stitches. He recently brought chaos in parliament after warning his daughter, who was in the gallery, to stay away from EFF members. “Thuli, if you are approached by anyone who is wearing boots and red overalls, run away and never look back,” he said. That was followed by uncontrollable laughter from MPs. It also led to EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi being called to order for trying to greet Mthembu’s daughter from the chamber. Who can ever forget the vibrator incident when the minister had an honest slip of a tongue moment in which he said vibrators instead of ventilators, which are used for Covid-19 patients? This was during an interministerial media briefing on lockdown regulations. However, the minister rectified his mistake and moved on with the business of the day. Another thing that will go down in the history books of South Africa media and politics was the classic chant that he formulated as the ANC boycotted our sister paper City Press in 2012. “Don’t buy City Press, don’t buy,” he chanted as the party showed the dissatisfaction after the paper published the spear drawing, depicting the then president Jacob Zuma naked. Mthembu was also captured in a video, where he is seen calling a young Julius Malema and other student activists to order in what looked like a failed meeting between the students and the leaders.
