KAIZER Chiefs might have made some progress this year but there is still a lot of work to be done. Their 1-1 draw against Baroka FC at FNB Stadium yesterday was yet another reminder of that for Gavin Hunt’s men. Chiefs have had an up and down season so far but generally underwhelming by their lofty standards. Hunt’s charges thought they had finally turned the corner when they went on a three-match winning run. They beat AmaZulu, Cape Town City and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) during their impressive run. But they seem to have run out of steam in recent matches, playing out to two draws against Stellenbosch FC and Bakgaga. Chiefs, though, will be somewhat relieved to have avoided defeat against Baroka. They were staring down the barrel of yet another defeat when Thamsanqa Masiya handed Bakgaga the lead in the 53rd minute. The 24-year-old midfielder ghosted into the penalty area and calmly slotted past Daniel Akpeyi in the Chiefs goal. Amakhosi, as they have had to do on numerous occasions this season, had to chase the match. And they finally clawed their way back into the encounter when substitute Leonardo Castro forced Goodman Mosele to score an own goal. Chiefs, who were determined to get back to winning ways, pushed for the winning goal but it did not come. Amakhosi will have to wait for the return leg for another shot at getting revenge against Baroka. It was Baroka who cost Chiefs the league last season with their 1-1 draw. Manuel Kambala's infamous 65th-minute equaliser earned the Limpopo outfit a share of the spoils in that match and handed Mamelodi Sundowns the title. Chiefs now turn their attention to the Soweto derby against Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (3.30 pm). Bakgaga face Cape Town City at Peter Mokaba on Sunday (3.30 pm).
