If sticks and stones can break your bones, then one can imagine what else can break in the human anatomy. Take the 4-5 for example. Itâ€™s classified as a muscle but the rhetorical question has always been: Can this boneless structure break like any other muscle? According to experts, the 4-5 can also suffer from a fracture. During an erection, the 4-5 is engorged with blood that fills two cylinders which are the corpora cavernosa. If an enlarged 4-5 is bent suddenly or forcibly, the trauma can rupture the outer lining of one of the two cylinders. This can result in a 4-5 fracture. This trauma is most often caused by sexual intercourse, such as when the 4-5 slips out of the punani and is accidentally thrust against the pelvis. Another fracture can also occur due to aggressive masturbation or taqaandan, a cultural practice in Middle Eastern cultures in which the top of an erect 4-5 is forcibly bent to relax an erection. Medical experts warn that a 4-5 fracture requires urgent medical attention.
