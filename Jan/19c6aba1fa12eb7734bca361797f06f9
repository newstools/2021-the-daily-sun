FOR these magoshas, it’s bye-bye bushes and hello bedroom! The ladies, who have been doing business in the bushes in Rooival, Tshwane for many years, have been forced to step up their services to a different level. The magoshas told Daily Sun they were exposed to criminal activities while doing business in the bushes and now they’re renting rooms for R20 to service a client once and they charge R70 for their services. According to them, the rooms are better and safer, especially in these times of rising gender-based violence. A magosha (27) told Daily Sun she’s been in the sex trade for about two years and she was now happy and felt safe satisfying men since they’ve been using rented rooms. “We don’t make a lot of money, but we have to keep on doing it because we don’t have jobs,” she said. “Sometimes we make more, other days less. It’s all about luck.” She said sometimes she would go home with R200, which was the same amount of money she made when she worked as a domestic worker in Pretoria North. She said when her boss moved to Durban in 2017, a friend introduced her to the sex trade. A magosha, only known as Precious, said that men were crazy about her. “In this business the other magoshas use muthi to get clients. But my punani does wonders for me,” she said. “In these rooms we are safe and clients can’t run into the bushes without paying.” Patience from North West said on a busy day, she could have seven clients. “Some clients give us extra money for a good service. We treat our clients very well so that they keep coming back.”
