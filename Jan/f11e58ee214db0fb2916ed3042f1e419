Black Coffee, who had Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi as host of the conference, said he worked with artists he’d always wanted to work with. “This time around I worked with artists I’ve always wanted to work with, but they were either busy or had other commitments. I’m glad to finally have been able to work with them,” said the 44-year-old, whose real name is Nkosinathi Maphumulo. Subconsciously, scheduled for worldwide release on 5 February, will be available on all streaming services and digital downloading platforms. A post shared by Black Coffee (@realblackcoffee)
