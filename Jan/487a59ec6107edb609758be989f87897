THE rapists didn’t use guns and knives to control their victims. They threw a net over the women to restrict their movements and dragged them into the bushes to rape them. A woman from Kagiso was their latest victim. The woman had just had an argument with her boyfriend, who lives at Boiketlo Hostel, on Monday and decided to go to her sister, who lives near the hostel. According to her sister, as the victim approached the gate leading to her sister’s room, she noticed the suspect and his accomplice standing next to the gate. “They had a net, which they suddenly threw over her,” said her sister. Captain Solomon Sibiya said the men dragged her into the bushes, where they took turns raping her. “The victim kept screaming for help during the ordeal, and hostel residents came to her rescue,” Sibiya told the People’s Paper. “The two suspects escaped and disappeared into the darkness.” The woman was taken to hospital for treatment and a case of rape was opened. Sibiya urged anyone with information that might lead to arrests and convictions to call investigating officer, Sergeant Gadebe at 011 696 9000/9065/9059. They can also call the CrimeStop telephone number, 08600 10111.
