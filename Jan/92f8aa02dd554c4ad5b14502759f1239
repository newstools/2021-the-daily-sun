ALTHOUGH the Arosi family did bury their mum last weekend, they’re unhappy with how the undertaker treated them. A community leader in Philippi in Cape Town, Nontuthuzelo Arosi (51) was buried at the Welmoed Cemetery. Her family said they received horrible service from a trusted undertaker. Nontuthuzelo’s daughter, Neliswa, said the undertaker brought the corpse to their home and just took off without saying a word. The driver was nowhere to be found when they wanted the corpse to be taken to church. The family had to use a relative’s Toyota Avanza instead of a hearse! As if that wasn’t enough, there was no tent or chairs when they arrived at the cemetery. Later on, they discovered the grave was small and not deep enough when they lowered the coffin. The average depth of a grave, according to by-laws, is 1,8m. “This is not the kind of burial I expected for my mother. This undertaker made it seem like we were burying her on credit,” said Neliswa.  She feared the coffin would get stolen. “This is supposed to be my mother’s final resting place, and the family isn’t satisfied,” she said. When Daily Sun  phoned Undertaker Luleka Bebeza, she said she was in the Eastern Cape and that her son and employee were handling the matter. “I don’t know why the driver was late, but he said the family didn’t relay the time they wanted to go to church when he delivered the body,” she said. Luleka said she’d told the family it wasn’t possible to provide chairs and a tent during Covid-19. On the size of the grave, her employee had told her everything was in order. “We’re related, which is why they didn’t take any random undertaker. I wouldn’t treat family like that.” Gravediggers told Daily Sun the undertaker was supposed to inform the family the grave wasn’t going to be deep enough as the area was waterlogged.
