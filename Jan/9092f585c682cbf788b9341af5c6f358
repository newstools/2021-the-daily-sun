We were in studio one day and Bluelle had a great beat. “I sang my song, Angfuni Macala, which I’d been working on for a while. We recorded the song in under 20 minutes. Just like that, my debut single was recorded,” said T Leeroi. Angfuni Macala was released last Friday. “Angfuni Macala is a song about me going to a club and meeting this beautiful girl. It’s actually a true story. “I fell in love with the girl, but she was with a gangster. Sadly, our relationship didn’t work out but inspired me to write about it.” He’s working on more singles and an EP. “I’m working on a single. I haven’t decided on the name or date, but it’s coming soon. I’ve got an EP coming and it’s coming with a new sound that Mzansi hasn’t heard before,” said Leeroi.
