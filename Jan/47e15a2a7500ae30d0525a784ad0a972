The 
National Energy Regulator of SA has allowed Eskom to collect an 
additional R6 billion of allowable revenue, in what could potentially 
see it implement tariff increases of up to 10.95% from April. In 
an announcement on Thursday, the regulator stated that the additional 
revenue would be recouped by Eskom over the 2021/22 financial year. 
Nhlanhla Gumede, who is responsible for Electricity Regulation at Nersa,
 stated that the figure still required approval. Nersa's 
decision is based on Eskom's Multi-Year Price Determination regulatory 
clearing account applications for the three financial years 2014/2015, 
2015/2016 and 2016/2017, and the firm's supplementary revenue 
application for 2018/2019. Gumede said the implication of the 
decision would be a tariff increase of between 8.12% and 10.95% if it 
were all liquidated in the 2022 financial year. Nersa said there 
seemed to be a correlation between tariff increases and a decrease in 
electricity demand."As Eskom tariffs have been increasing, the demand 
for electricity has been declining... this could be due to substitution 
or other reasons," said Gumede. Eskom had originally applied for 
R66.6 billion terms of the Regulatory Clearing Account, but Nersa 
allowed it R34.69 billion, prompting a court challenge by Eskom. In June
 2020, the High Court ordered the regulator to review the decision. The
 power utility said in statement it will have to assess whether the 
decision is in line with the High Court judgement and order. Fin24
