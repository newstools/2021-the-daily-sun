CAF Presidential candidate Patrice Motsepe this week took his campaign to Cameroon where he spent  week talking to various African FA Presidents. Most of the continent’s 54 FA Presidents are in Cameroon to attend the Chan 2021 and Motsepe and his team have been busy articulating their vision to take Africa football to the next level. Motsepe has emerged as among the frontrunners for the CAF Presidency and has so far taken his campaign to most parts of the continent. Motsepe, a mining magnate and reportedly South Africa’s third-richest person, had his candidacy for the role approved and supported by the South Africa Football Association (Safa) in November last year. Other federations to have backed Motsepe include Botswana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Sierra Leone according to the reports. Last week, Motsepe spent most of his time in West Africa where he went to Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea Conakry, Togo, Ivory Coast and Benin among others. There he met and had fruitful engagements with those countries’ FA Presidents. He launched his campaign among COSAFA Member Associations and in coming weeks will be consolidating his campaign within COSAFA before heading to CECAFA. The CAF Presidential Elections will take place in Morocco on 12 March 2021
