People should consider budgeting and saving for rainy days. Debt is the enemy of success and people should try to avoid it by all means. The impact of last year is still being felt and will be present for the foreseeable future. January should be the month that people start budgeting and not complaining about not having money. Start pushing yourself by being hard on yourself and cutting unnecessary things you don’t need. Unlike what you might believe, budgeting is not all about restricting what you spend money on and cutting out all the fun in you. Keep doing your budget every month to track your spending. Don’t wait for next month because before you know it, it will be Easter holidays. A strict budget helps you gain control of your finances. ) Rachel Molema Theresa Mews
