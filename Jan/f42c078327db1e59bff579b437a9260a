DIFFERENCE Tiwane (34) will learn his fate on Monday, 25 January when the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court delivers its verdict on his bail application. Tiwane is facing two counts of murder in connection with the deaths of mineworker Rose Vilakazi (33) and her daughter Accurate (19). Tiwane’s lawyer, Vusi Segodi, said: “There’s no direct evidence against my client. He didn’t run away from police until they arrested him at his home at nearby Lillydale. “So it’s my humble submission to at least grant him bail with conditions attached: that he must not interfere with witnesses and avail himself to this court.” Investigating officer, Detective-Sergeant Sbusiso Sibuyi, opposed bail, saying: “Police have a strong case against the accused, and that’s why I’m opposing his bail. The witnesses in this matter won’t be safe. “Even the accused won’t be safe because the community is angry at him and protesting. They threaten to take the law into their own hands if he’s released. “The accused gave a false address in his affidavit in Rustenburg. Police found him with blood-stained clothes which have been sent for DNA tests.” Prosecutor Mavis Mashimbyi said two of his kids’ mums said he doesn’t support them. The third said he pays maintenance. Magistrate Nhlanhla Malomane postponed the matter.
