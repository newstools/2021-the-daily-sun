MARITZBURG United coach Ernst Middendorp says Judas Moseamedi will play a crucial role for his side this season and he will take advantage of his quality. The former Kaizer Chiefs coach said Moseamedi is a key part of his plans and he’ll play plenty of games because he’s an important player. Moseamedi showed his importance in the side as the 26-year-old scored twice when Maritzburg defeated Kaizer Chiefs 2-0 in a DStv Premiership clash at FNB Stadium on Saturday. It was second league win of the season for Team of Choice after beating Bloemfontein Celtic in the previous game. Now they have moved out of the relegation zone. It was Moseamedi’s second brace this season. He scored twice against Stellenbosch FC in the last game of 2020 before the December break. “When I came here on 26 November, I had a very clear short conversation him and told him a player of his quality must be a starter,” said Middendorp. “Since I came in he has started all matches and he is getting better and better. He’s one of my crucial players, not only on Saturday, but he was crucial in the past matches. I hope he can continue progressing.” This was Moseamedi’s second brace against Chiefs. The first came in the Telkom Knockout semi-final last year at Mbombela Stadium. Middendorp also showered defender Clayton Daniels with praise. He said he has filled the leadership role in defence after the departure of goalkeeper Richard Ofori to Orlando Pirates at the start of the season. Daniels was recently signed after he left SuperSport United. In two games Daniels has played for the club, Maritzburg has won both. “We had no leadership (before Daniels joined us), we had nobody to give guidance to other players,” said Middendorp who worked with Daniels previously at Celtic. “We all know that Ofori was the central guy last year. He was very vocal, impressive, significant, and the guy who demonstrated his leadership at the back.”
