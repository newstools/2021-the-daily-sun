MINISTER of Sports Nathi Mthethwa has promised to engage the
SA Football Association (Safa) in his quest to find a resolution that will see
PSL club bosses consider staff when selling statuses. It has been a burning issue in the country with club
statuses being sold and staff left on the lurch and unemployed, which includes
players. Mthethwa wants to ensure players and staff are prioritized
when new owners come on board. The latest case in point is the selling of Tshakhuma Tsha
Madzivhandila (TTM) from Masala Mulaudzi to Abram Sello this week. Mulaudzi bought Bidvest Wits' status five months ago and
frustrated players by letting most of them go, while some are still owed money
from the previous club. Now TTM are swimming in a pool of debts resulting from the
exchange of hands between Wits and Mulaudzi. On Monday, Mulaudzi met with the players and Sello to
explain to them that the club have been sold, according to our sources at a
reported R50 million. But some of the players that spoke to Daily Sun on condition
of anonymity, they are in the dark about their future since the club has been
sold. Others like Oupa Manyisa and Joseph Molangoane have taken
the club to the PSL’s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) seeking compensation
through the intervention of the league. The duo are owed salaries while former coach Vladislav Heric
is also demanding R5m for "unfair dismissal". Much as Mthethwa said his Ministry has "no business to
meddle in private affairs" in the market economy like that in South
Africa, but he is concerned by those getting raw deals. "What concerns me is that when it affects staff,
players and so on. When such transactions are concluded without really taking
on board the plight of players and staff. We are raising that to the mother
board of football in South Africa to say it’s a matter that needs to be looked
into and ensure there is stability particularly from the key stake holders,”
Mthethwa told eNCA on Thursday.
