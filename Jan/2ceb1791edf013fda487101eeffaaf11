PITSO Mosimane has thrown his weight behind Patrice
Motsepe for the Caf presidency. Coaches are often reluctant to be drawn on football
politics, but Mosimane has broken with convention, declaring his support for
his former boss. Mosimane, now coach of Al Ahly, spent seven successful
years at Mamelodi Sundowns where he worked with club president, Motsepe, to
re-establish the Tshwane giants as a force locally and on the continent. Now he wants to see Motsepe occupy the most powerful
position in African football. The reknown businessman and philanthropist is one the
four candidates vying for the position, including Ahmed Yahya of Mauritania,
Augustin Senghor, the president of the Senegal FA, and Ivory Coast FA president
Jacques Anouma. “I’m pro Cosafa. The president of Sundowns has done well
for me and I have rewarded him well with the work. I have a very good
relationship with him,” Mosimane told the Safja virtual press briefing on
Wednesday. “There is no doubt that he is the right person. I believe
he should get the chance. Why not? “Maybe we need a businessperson more than not a football
person. Motsepe hasn’t been in the Caf committees. But as he always says, he
surrounds himself with the right people. I believe he can do it. “People not only look at him as a businessman but as
Sundowns president. Sundowns is recognised on the continent. I’m happy I
contributed to the Mamelodi Sundowns that everybody talks about. The gulf knows
it, Africa knows it.” Despite several trips Motsepe has made to Cairo, Mosimane
said the two haven’t had a chance to meet. “I haven’t seen him, but I can help him where I can help.
I don’t exactly know if I can help. I don’t deal with Caf presidents. I’m not a
campaigner. But I’d put in a good name for him. He’s got my tick next to his
name. “Let’s have a South African president in Caf. This will
open other things.”
