DOZENS of taxis in Polokwane, Limpopo were fumigated on Wednesday, 20 January after ranks were identified as Covid-19 super-spreaders. The deep-cleaning campaing was overseen by Transport MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya. “We’re here to remind you that our department recognises you as frontline workers. We know that you need our support,” he said. “With the sanitisers being given to you, we say clean your taxis. You might have transported people who’d contracted the virus.” The MEC was joined by Capricorn district mayor, John Mpe, who encouraged taximen and commuters to practise social distancing and wear their masks.  Frans Kgasago, speaking on behalf of the Mankweng Taxi Association, thanked the department. He told Daily Sun: “We assure our commuters their safety is our concern. We promise that with these sanitisers, we’ll clean our taxis regularly.” Commuter Maggie Malatjie (42) was convinced taxi ranks would be safer after a large number of sanitisers were given to drivers. “The beginning of this month was very scary after four taxi bosses died of the virus,” Malatjie told the People’s Paper. “We hope that our drivers will follow the rules and regulations to help us fight this killer disease.”
