KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt says the return to action from injury of his top striker Samir Nurkovic is a massive welcomed boost. Nurkovic showed why Amakhosi missed him since the start of the DStv Premiership season when he netted the only goal in the 1-0 win over AmaZulu at Jonsson Kings Park on Wednesday. The 28-year-old Serbian missed the start of the season due to a groin injury that needed surgery. He netted 14 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions last season, and has been hugely missed by the Soweto giants. The victory against Usuthu was Chiefs’ second league win of the season as the Glamour Boys have struggled to find their form this term under Hunt. The win also saw Chiefs preserve their unbeaten away record against AmaZulu in the PSL era. Hunt said he didn’t want to play Nurkovic for the entire 90 minutes, but he had no choice because he has no fully fit strikers due Covid-19 and injuries. “I thought Samir was fantastic,” said Hunt of his burly striker. “If you have a guy like Samir playing every week, he will help you. You look at what he did in last season’s first 10 games, he was brilliant.” Hunt also admitted that defensively they have let themselves down this season by conceding so many goals. “We should have won more games but the table doesn’t lie so we have been poor defensively,” lamented Hunt whose win over Usuthu saw them move to 10th on the table. Chiefs will aim to build on this win when they face Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday (5pm). “We play two away games in Cape Town (Stellenbosch FC on 23 January) they are very good at home,” said Hunt. “It won’t be easy. Hopefully it will be cooler (in Cape Town) because on Wednesday (in Durban) it was a really hot day.”
