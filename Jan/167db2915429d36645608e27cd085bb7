NOKO Matlou believes South African women’s football would be far had the SA Football Association (Safa) taken women's sport "serious". “We would be far if they took women's football serious, because we have the talent and everything in South Africa compared to other teams who are struggling in Europe," said the Banyana Banyana veteran. Matlou is one of the senior players who have been present since making her national team debut in 2006. The 35-year-old signed her first-ever professional contract with Spanish side Eibar last year. Looking at Mzansi’s women's football and some clubs overseas, Matlou feels South Africa should be competing among the best European countries "because we've got everything". In an interview with South African Football Journalists' Association's (Safja) on Thursday, Matlou said: “It starts with our association." She went on: “If our association can stand for us as women and say we want to do this and that for women, Banyana were going to improve when going to global competitions. “But even us as players we have to fight with our association even though we know we can’t win the fight, but at least if they can meet us halfway it will be better for women's football to improve.” Matlou is proving that age is just a number in Spain. She made two appearances for Eibar and played 90 minutes in both matches. She made her Primera División debut on 6 January when her side defeated Logrono 2-0 at home. Matlou also revealed that before joining the Spanish side, she got an offer from China but couldn’t go there because of the Coronavirus which was at its peak in the Asian country last year March. “I got a contract in February to go to China, but because of coronavirus and other delays, I could not make it there. Then this offer came, I was so happy to final go play overseas. It was emotional because many people had written to me off because of my age.”
