ORLANDO Pirates left-back Innocent Maela could be condemned to the bench for longer than he foresees. Maela warmed the bench when Pirates drew goalless with Golden Arrows at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday. His relegation from the starting line-up came after he scored an own goal in their 2-0 defeat to Black Leopards in Thohoyandou on Sunday. Even though Maela might be expecting his punishment to end soon, Bongani Sam gave Bucs coach Josef Zinnbauer every reason to believe that he made the right decision to bring him on board as he grabbed the opportunity with both hands. The German born mentor was satisfied with Sam’s contribution on the night as he gave Abafana Bes’thende defence a tough time on the left flank while adding stability on Bucs rear-guard. “Happy (Jele) made a positive contribution. Sam created good scoring opportunities with his crosses, running into the opposition final third. There was no problem for us in defence today,” explained Zinnbauer. Although, Pirates have picked up just one win in their last five league games, Zinnbauer is not pressing any panic button. He is confident that his charges will narrow the eight points gap between them and leaders Mamelodi Sundowns who are tied with Swallows FC on 26 points. The Soweto giants occupy sixth spot on the league table with 18 points from 12 matches. Pirates meet Maritzburg at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday (5pm) “It’s a lot of small things that caused our ups and down on the league. Our focus is on our game on Saturday. Our performance was much better and points are coming,” concluded Zinnbauer.
