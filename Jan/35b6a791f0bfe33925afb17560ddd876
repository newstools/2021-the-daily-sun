To say our weather patterns are on the extreme side of things would be putting it mildly. According to the South African Weather Service, Mzansi is currently experiencing a massive heatwave which is ravishing the country. From the inlands to the coastal areas, this heat has become unbearable and an immediate remedy is required to deal with these weather patterns. Here are some creative ways to help you deal with this heat: 1. Eat Spicy Foods As crazy as it may sound, eating spicy foods raises your body temperature, which can make you sweat. This in turn can help you cool off faster. 2. Make A Cold Water Bottle You know how you can use hot water bottles to keep warm in the winter? Well, you can do the same thing in the summer. 3. Take Cold Baths Instead of taking that cold shower, try taking a cold bath which experts say is more effective.
