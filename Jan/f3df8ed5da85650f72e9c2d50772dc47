TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula is concerned over the number of pedestrians killed on Western Cape roads since the beginning of the festive season. Mbalula and Transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela visited Paarl today. Mbalula was happy with how motorists were adhering to level 3 regulations. “So far, so good. We’re encouraged that the response is positive. People are wearing their masks and carrying all the necessary documents. “Ever since we arrived, law and order on the roads has been encouraging.” The minister, however, raised concern over the death of pedestrians. “Of the 25 people who died on our roads from 1 December to 20 December, 11 are pedestrians,” he said. “We urge pedestrians to always remain vigilant to avoid getting involved in accidents.” Madikizela attributed compliance on Western Cape roads to dedicated traffic cops. “Looking at the figures from 21 December, I’m really encouraged by the number of roadblocks. We had 274 roadblockss, which shows our traffic officers are in full force,” he said. But the issue of pedestrians getting involved in accidents had been going on for a long time. “We’re seeing a number of people complying, not only with the rules of the road but also regarding Covid-19 regulations,” said Madikizela.
