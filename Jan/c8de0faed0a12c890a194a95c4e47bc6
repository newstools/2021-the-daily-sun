On Monday NUMSA took to the streets to demand that 99 workers who were retrenched from Macsteel in December be given their jobs back. The union called off its strike after it reached an agreement with the steel producing company that the retrenched workers can return to work on Monday 25 January. Its secretary-general Irvin Jim said they are happy that the workers have got their jobs back. “We are pleased to say that Macsteel has agreed that all employees who were retrenched must report to their offices on Monday the 25th of January in order to discuss their placement in vacant positions available.  “Management has given its full assurance that it will endeavour to place every employee who was retrenched into a new position,” said Jim. The agreement is that workers before the end of February. These employees must also be placed into positions which most closely match their previous positions. “As far as is reasonably possible, Macsteel will ensure that they do not earn less than what they earned before retrenchment,” said Jim. Jim said the union will nominate two individuals to actively participate in the placement process. “Macsteel has given an undertaking that it will provide all the relevant information pertaining to this process,” said Jim. Macsteel confirmed that the deadlock between the company and workers has been resolved. “Macsteel welcomes the return to work of its employees this morning as the impasse between unionised and non-unionised workers is resolved. The company reached a mutual consensus with the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa late yesterday. Macsteel regrets the need for these retrenchments but remains committed to adapting to changing economic conditions and protecting remaining jobs,” Macsteel said.
