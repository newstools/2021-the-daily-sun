RAIN caused havoc over the weekend and even left a hospital flooded. Videos circulating on social media show water flowing down the stairs and seeping into rooms through the cracks under doors at Leratong Hospital in Mogale City, Gauteng. Another video showed a brick wall collapsing while in a third one, a woman could be heard shouting: “The hospital is flooding! 2021, guys, we are dying here in Leratong. This is ward 14, guys!” Hospital CEO Keke Moloi said the incident happened at night and the water had been cleared by Sunday 3 December. She said the X-ray area, casualty, wards on the ground floor and front line areas were affected. “Fortunately, no patient was affected by the incident. We have managed to stabilise the situation and the hospital has been opened for services,” she said.  Meanwhile on Sunday, residents of Protea Glen in Soweto were forced on to the streets after their houses were damaged by flooding. They barricaded roads with burning tyres. Councillor Phelelani Sindani told Daily Sun he was engaging with the municipality to attend to the poor drainage system in the area. He said at least 15 houses in extension 29 were affected. Magdalene Vilakazi from Protea Glen said she was woken by her leaking roof. “I live alone and I had no idea what to do. I just sat in a corner and watched my roof collapse, destroying everything,” she said. Pinki Mokoena (35) from Lenasia in Joburg said she was sleeping with her eight-month-old baby when they were woken by the roof falling in.  “My roof is gone and everything in my house was destroyed,” she said. Jane Nkonyane (27), also from Lenasia, said she was saved by her ancestors when the same thing happened to her roof. Joburg EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said flash floods were reported in some parts of Lenasia and Protea Glen. “The swift water rescue unit was on site to assist affected households. The team remains on high alert,” he said.
