SANGOMA Mavuso Gqola has been helping his kasi for several years and people know and trust him. The popular sangoma, who is wheelchair-bound, told Daily Sun he was now preparing to run as an independent candidate in the local government elections this year. “I’m a businessperson. I was not into politics, but people changed my mind and they want me to lead them. “I was approached by community members who told me they did not see their councillors during these difficult times, but I’m always available. They said they wanted me to be their leader, so I thought about it and decided why not,” said Mavuso. He also believes the ancestors used people to uplift him from being a sangoma to a leader. “Ancestors sometimes speak through people. They want me to be a leader and I cannot turn them down,” he told the People’s Paper. Mavuso said he did not want to join a political party because of the toxic political situation in Mzansi. “People kill each other for positions. I don’t want to be part of that mess,” he said. He said he was ready to stand as a councillor if people elected him. Asked whether politics would interfere with his sangoma duties, Mavuso. said it was a matter of planning well. “What is needed is to be time conscious and organised. It is manageable,” he said. Bheki Nthulana (41) from Burundi squatter camp said he was one of the people who begged Mavuso to be their councillor. “We hardly see our councillor. Ask anyone around here if they know their councillor. You should ask them if they know Mavuso, the answer you get tells you who is the leader of this kasi. “Mavuso makes sure people get food, even kids get school uniforms from him,” said Bheki.
