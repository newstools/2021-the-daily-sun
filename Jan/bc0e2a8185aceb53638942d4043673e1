DEEP house DJ, Koketso Destroyer, is excited about showing Mzansi his production skills. The 22-year-old, whose real name is Koketso Rabekane, will release his first project this year. From Mokopane in Limpopo, Koketso is a self-taught producer who can’t wait to finally drop his own music. Speaking to SunBuzz, Koketso said: “I’ve been DJing for a while and I knew I’d eventually start producing. I decided to do this myself because when you ask people for help they give excuses. I’m happy to have taught myself.” The artist admitted it hasn’t been easy. ALSO READ: MY FRIEND DITCHED ME FOR MAKHADZI He said: “Using YouTube tutorials and apps has been difficult. But I finally managed and can’t wait to release my first project.” The musician, a second-year Public Relations student at Rosebank College, said it was his friends who motivated him to get into production. “People around me have been pushing me to get into production because they saw how passionate I was about music and DJing. “I didn’t think I was ready then, but that was a great decision.” His debut EP will be titled To The World. “This name literally describes me introducing myself to the industry. I’m making music that will also take me internationally,” he said.
