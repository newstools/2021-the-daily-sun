There’s nothing wrong with the consumption of alcohol if consumed responsibly. But in Mzansi, it causes many problems. We just seem to have a very big problem with the bottle. Many road accidents used to overwhelm the hospital trauma units before the president announced the adjusted lockdown level three, and many family and financial problems are caused by the abuse of alcohol. But since the sale of alcohol was banned before New Year’s Eve, there have been lesser trauma cases at hospitals and fewer road crashes. This proves that alcohol is the root cause. It’s about time we deal with this problem. I understand that the alcohol industry contributes to our economy, but it is of no use if it’s killing us.
