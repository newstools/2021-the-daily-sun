SuperSport United mean business this season.At least that’s what it seems like so far. The Tshwane outfit bagged another win as they defeated struggling Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila 2-0 at Thohoyandou Stadium. SuperSport’s main man, Bradley Grobler, was on the scoresheet once more alongside Sipho Mbule. Grobler, the league top scorer, bagged his 12th goal of the season and seems determined to take home the golden boot at the end of the season. The result saw Matsatsantsa A Pitori climb over Swallows FC into second place in the DStv Premiership standings. They are level with defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns as well as the Dube Birds on 27 points from 13 matches. Their superior goal difference sees them occupy second spot ahead of the Birds. Meanwhile, TTM’s struggles seem to be worsening with every match. The Limpopo outfit are winless in their last nine matches and the table tells a sorry tale for them. They are rooted to the foot of the table having only managed to pick up nine points from 13 outings.
