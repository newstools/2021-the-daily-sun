IN sharp contrast to previous years, the streets of Hillbrow in Joburg were deserted on New Year’s Eve. In the past, people threw things, including fridges, from upper storey windows. This year people heeded the call and were off the streets by 9pm. However, the call by Police Minister Bheki Cele – that people should be in bed at that time – was shown the middle finger as they partied the night away on their balconies. Fireworks lit the night sky, but locals seemed to realise the value of their furniture and appliances and threw nothing onto the street. Addressing police after patrolling the streets, Gauteng provincial commissioner, Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, said: “Here in Hillbrow, to me it’s mission accomplished. Peace and harmony. So far, we’ve achievsed that – people enjoying themselves without violence.” He said there were no street fights.  “We hope people will carry on like this into the future so we don’t have fatalities and injuries,” he said. Some cops even took a photo with the commissioner. Mawela said there were no challenges year before last, either. “There was no lockdown, but people were just jovial in the streets and having a good time.” He said the secret to success in areas such as Hillbrow was continuous engagement with the community through the CPF. “Thus far, we’ve made 94 arrests in other areas in Gauteng, mostly for contravening disaster management regulations. “We’ve had nine arrests for drinking and driving and one suspect was arrested for an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. “For now, I think, we’ve achieved our objective.”
