Swallows FC maintained their unbeaten run in the DStv Premiership when they held Mamelodi Sundowns to a 1-1 draw at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Musa Nyatama's last-minutes header saw the two sides sharing a point and remain top of the Premiership table. Both Sundowns and Swallows have 27 points each after 13 matches, they are separated by goal difference with Sundowns at the number one spot.Kermit Erasmus was the first to found the back of the net to put the defending champions Sundowns ahead just before half time following their dominance in the first stanza of the match. Swallows displays improved in the second half as the likes of Ruzaigh Gamildien and captain Lebohang Mokoena troubled Sundowns defence but could not get an early goal. The Dube Birds never gave up on their attempts to level the matters and their prayers were answered in the last minutes of the match. George Maluleka gave away a free-kick on the edge of the box and Swallows made no mistake as Kagiso Malinga stepped up and his powerful free-kick was saved by Dennis Onyango who gave the ball into the path of Musa Nyatama. Nyatama made no mistake as he punished Downs with a header to earn his side a point in the top of the table clash. Swallows determination and never give up mentality proved to be working for them as this was not their first match where they secured a point in with a last-minute gasp. They did the same against Orlando Pirates earlier this month, they found the equaliser in second-half stoppage time to play to a 1-1 draw. They remain undefeated in the top flight since they gained automatic promotion from GladAfrica Championship.
