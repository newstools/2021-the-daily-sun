Two suspects who were allegedly caught red-handed busy stealing diesel at Clenco Mini in Ogies will remain in police custody until Wednesday 20 January. The suspects aged (33) and (42) appeared before the Ogies Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on Friday 15 January. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi, the two suspects were arrested by members of Protea Coin Security. They were bust on Wednesday night (13 January) while allegedly stealing diesel from the pipelines at Clenco Mine in Ogies. “It is alleged that an employee of Clenco Mine colluded with the diesel truck driver to steal the diesel from the pipelines using the tag of one of the mine tankers which was parked in the workshop. “A preliminary probe by the Hawks team allegedly revealed that the owner of the truck is a person of interest in another diesel theft related case. During the arrest, 11 425 litres of diesel was already pumped into the tanker with an estimated value of R142 000. “Their case is postponed to Wednesday 20 January for a formal bail application. The suspects will remain in custody while the investigation continues,” said Sekgotodi
