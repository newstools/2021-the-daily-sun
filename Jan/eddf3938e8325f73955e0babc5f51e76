KAIZER Chiefs striker Samir Nurkovic has heaped praise on young Nkosingiphile Ngcobo. Ngcobo has been a breath of fresh air for Amakhosi this season despite the club having a terrible start to the new season. On Tuesday Ngcobo scored his second goal in a row for Amakhosi when they thumped Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila 3-0 at FNB Stadium. Nurkovic provided an assist for Ngcobo when he latched onto a throw-in from the right before guiding the ball across the edge of the TTM box into the direction of the youngster who made no mistake to put Amakhosi on the lead. "It was a nice run from the little star," Nurkovic told SuperSport TV after the game. “The little star is the future of Kaizer Chiefs. I saw him and I just flicked it on, and after that, he did the rest. Amazing what he did there." Nurkovic has made a huge impact since returning from long-term injury this month, scoring one goal and creating two assists in his last three outings, while also offering a physical presence as the target man. “After three tough months for me of surgery and recovery, I am happy to be on the field again and to help the boys as much as possible,” the Serbian said. “I’m trying to help as much as possible the team to victories. Obviously, I’m upfront to score goals and to assist goals and to help them."
