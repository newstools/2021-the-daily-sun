BRANDON Truter has received widespread praise for his outstanding job with Swallows FC. The Birds have punched above their weight since they returned to the elite league. Among Truter’s praise singers is Manqoba Mngqithi. But the Mamelodi Sundowns co-coach insists Truter’s side benefitted from an off-side goal in their latest match. The Brazilians looked to be home and dry with a 1-0 lead, but Musa Nyatama headed in a last-minute equaliser on Saturday. “I honestly think it was a very big offside, I have not seen it, but in my mind, I’m saying are they benefitting? Because even against Pirates there was a blatant penalty. Even today (Saturday) it was a blatant the offside which I think the linesman was in line with,” said Mngqithi. “But in football, you must accept these things but it looks like they are benefitting, I just want to see more because they’ve got a lot of penalties on their side.” However, Mngqithi has described Swallows as a well-coached team, lavishing Truter with praise. “The good thing about them is that they’re a good team. They are playing some very good football although today they played in some patches. They’re coached very well, and Brandon Truter has done a tremendous job. They’re a good team. We were unfortunate not to win this one, I believe we did everything in our power to win.”
