SONGBIRD Simphiwe Dana is head over heels in love with her fiancee Pumeza Matshikiza, who popped the question last month. The singer has become the latest female celebrity to reveal that she’s getting married to another woman. In November last year, the star shocked her fans when she took the bold step of coming out as lesbian. At the time, she shared that she had kept this secret for far too long and felt that it was the right time to reveal who she really was.
