SUPERSPORT United striker Bradley Grobler has described the feat of breaking the late Abram Raselemane’s record as ‘an honour.’ The reserved yet lethal striker became Matsatsantsa A Pitori’s all-time top goalscorer with 58 goals on Wednesday. His goal along with that of strike partner Thamsanqa Gabuza handed SuperSport a 2-1 DStv Premiership win over Bloemfontein Celtic at Lucas Moripe Stadium. United coach Kaitano Tembo will once again put his hopes on Grobler and his strike partner Gabuza when they face leaders Mamelodi Sundowns in a top of the table clash at the Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (3 pm). Grobler has played a key role in SuperSport’s impressive start to the season which now sees them occupy second place in the Premiership table. United climbed above Swallows FC into second place with 22 points from 10 matches. They are now just two points adrift of defending champions Sundowns. Their impressive run has seen them win five of their last six matches and they seem to be finding the consistency needed to challenge for the title. Their main man, Grobler, has been responsible for 10 of the 19 goals United have scored so far this season. He is also currently the league’s top goalscorer. “It’s an unbelievable feeling,” said a delighted Grobler. “I think when people mentioned the 57 goals it seemed so far away at the time, I think I was six goals away but when I equalled it last week I thought it would be the toughest task to surpass it and go one more. “But fortunately, this happened sooner than I expected. The club has done a lot for me. They have stuck with me through thick and thin, through all my injuries and this is just my way of thanking them and repaying the faith they have shown in me. This is a great club and a very prestigious club so I’m honoured to have achieved this at this club.”
