NOLUVUYO Soga’s family has been left traumatised by her death. She died in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape two weeks ago after the family was told she had recovered from Covid-19. Noluvuyo’s sister Nonceba (59), who is based in Cape Town, said she was admitted to Livingstone Hospital but later moved to a field hospital as she was feeling better. She said the family was called to fetch Noluvuyo on the day before Christmas but when they arrived, they were told she died. “They could not find her at the field hospital and we were told she had been sent back to the ward where she was previously treated. However, she was not there either. We later learnt she had died.” Nonceba said her sister went to visit the doctor on 21 December after feeling ill. She tested positive for the virus and was taken to Livingstone Hospital. She was later moved to Dr Mamisa Chabula-Nxiweni Field Hospital. “How is it possible that she died after we received a call to fetch her? We need answers because this has really traumatised us as a family. We need closure.” Noluvuyo, who was a community care worker in the Linton Grange area of Port Elizabeth, was buried on 30 December. Health department spokesman Siyanda Manana said he was aware of the case but he disputed the family’s version of events. He did not give the department’s side of the story and referred the SunTeam back to the family. “The events as they unfolded here are quite different from how you allege. Fortunately I’m aware of the sequence of events as family members interacted with me regarding Ms Soga before her passing,” said Manana. According to hospital records as dated 24 December 2020 at 08.10am the family was contacted to inform them on the patient's death but the next of kin's phone was on voicemail. Further no records of any visit on our security guards as the criteria states that was done to the patient on the 24th of December, " said Siyanda Manana
