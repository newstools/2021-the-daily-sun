The reopening of schools in South Africa has been
delayed for two weeks due to the steep increase of Covid-19 infections.  Schools were initially expected to open on 25
January for teachers and 27 January for pupils. But, following consultations with education
stakeholders, including teacher unions, school governing bodies and independent
schools' associations, the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC), Cabinet
and the Council of Education Ministers (CEM) decided to delay the reopening,
especially since the new variant of the virus in South Africa was said to
affect young people. Making the announcement during a media briefing in
Pretoria on Friday, Basic Education Deputy Minister Reginah Mhaule said the
decision was taken to give relief to the health system, which is already not
coping due to the high number of Covid-19 cases. Minister Angie Motshekga was not present at the
briefing because she is on "sick leave", according to her deputy. Mhaule said: "[The] CEM took this difficult decision,
having considered all factors, as backed up by research and statistics,
regarding the current state of the health system. The priority remains saving
lives." Early Childhood Development Centres were also
expected to delay their reopening, the department said. Mhaule said the department would also study the new
variant, under the guidance of the health department. She emphasised that the decision for the delay was
not to punish anyone or any school, but to save lives. Motshekga's advisor, Mzwandile Matthews, said
independent schools' associations, which were part of the consultations, agreed
to persuade members that already opened to follow the reopening protocol.  "Those schools (independent), unfortunately we
can't direct them. We are expecting that they will consider closing and reopen
as stated by the deputy minister," Matthews said.
