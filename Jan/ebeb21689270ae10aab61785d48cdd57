RED-HOT SuperSport United striker Bradley Grobler has etched his name in the history books of the club. The 32-year-old scored his 58th goal for Matsatsantsa A Pitori as they downed Bloemfontein Celtic 2-1 at Lucas Moripe Stadium yesterday. The goal carries huge significance for the Bafana Bafana international as it saw him become SuperSport’s all-time goal scorer. Grobler eclipsed Abram Raselemane on the list of the highest scorers in the club’s history. The result saw Kaitano Tembo’s charges overtake Swallows FC into second place on the DStv Premiership table with 20 points from ten matches. They are now just two points adrift of leaders and defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns who still sit pretty at the top of the log. SuperSport, who are determined to challenge for the title this season, seem to be finding the consistency needed to do so. They have now won five of their last six matches as they look to push their neighbors Sundowns all the way this time around. And central to their steady club up the table has been the lethal partnership of their red-hot strikers Grobler and Thamsanqa Gabuza. The duo has now been responsible for 15 of SuperSport’s 19 goals so far this season, forming a deadly partnership upfront for the Tshwane outfit. It was Gabuza who opened the scoring for Matsatsantsa as early as the 13th minute but Celtic would draw level from the penalty spot through Victor Letsoalo. And just when it seemed like the two teams would go into the halftime break level, Grobler popped up with the historic goal to regain his side the lead. Celtic could not claw their way back into the encounter and suffered their fifth defeat of the season. Phunya Sele Sele are now winless in their last five matches in all competitions and will be desperate to get back on the winning trail. They next face Stellenbosch FC at Dr Molemela Stadium on Saturday (3.30 pm) while SuperSport faces Sundowns in a top of the table clash at the same venue.
