TWO suspects, aged 28 and 39, were arrested while busy stealing fuel at Kendal near Kriel in Mpumalanga on Thursday 21 January. According Mpumalanga Hawks Spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi, the two were arrested after the Transnet control room detected a fuel pressure drop in the pipeline. Authorities responded to the matter and nabbed one suspect who had attempted to run away. He had fresh burn marks all over his body. There was a big fire in the maize field nearby and upon inspection, authorities realised the flames were from the burning Transnet pipeline.  “The Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation team and local police were summoned to the scene for further investigation. Following an intensive search, a second suspect who was also badly burnt was apprehended after he was found hiding under a bridge. “Emergency services were summoned and the two suspects were transported to the hospital under police guard. All the exhibits, which included a white Mazda bakkie, a generator and pieces of charred clothes, were confiscated for further investigation”. Sekgotodi said the suspects are expected to appear before the Phola Magistrates Court on Monday 25 January to face charges of malicious damage to property, tampering with essential infrastructure and theft of fuel.
