With Covid-19 still sadly in our midst, many companies have resorted to their employees working from home. This has seen a rise in virtual activities such as meetings, team-building and conference calls. According to CEO of the world’s largest web-camera manufacturer Logitech’s Bracken P Darrell, their profit margins have almost doubled since the start of the global pandemic. With everyone using platforms such as Zoom, Skype and Microsoft-Teams, here are some key etiquette rules for using virtual platforms: 1. Mute your microphone when you’re not talking There’s nothing more frustrating than hearing that background noise which your microphone picks up. It’s also annoying for everyone else in the meeting to hear someone blabbing away in the background. 2. Leave the keyboard alone Whether you’re diligently taking notes or sneakily chatting with your work bestie, the sound of your typing is distracting. 3. Dress appropriately One of the magical things about working remotely is the freedom to wear anything to work. Should you then be required to show your face, do look the part.
