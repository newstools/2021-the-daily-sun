ANGRY residents told Daily Sun they’ve been trying to repair the road with a giant pothole themselves. But it has become so bad there’s nothing ordinary citizens can do about it. Residents and motorists are complaining about Mathale Avenue in Lusaka, Mamelodi East in Tshwane, which they said started as a small pothole. Motorists are pleading with the municipality to fix the road as it damages their vehicles. Resident Tshepo Fakude (54) said the damage on the road can cause an accident at any time. “We hope that the municipality can hear our plea and fix the road. “I close my eyes when cars overtake on this bad road,” he said. Marriam Mofokeng (34) said she takes a 10-minute detour to board a taxi at a safer place. “I’m not comfortable even walking around the place,” she said.  Marriam said the young men who were fixing the road have given up because they didn’t have the equipment for such a big job. Motorist Daniel Tau (45) said cars struggle to pass each other on the road. “The trench in the tarred road becomes bigger every day, especially when it rains,” he said. City of Tshwane’s acting chief of staff, Jordan Griffiths, said the city was aware of the state of the road infrastructure. “It’s a priority focus for us in the coming weeks to begin aggressive rolling out of road maintenance repairs.” He said one of their challenges of service delivery tenders, particularly related to grass cutting and also to buying bitumen, have been finalised by ANC administrators. “We have finalised buying of bitumen which is used to create hot tar used to fill potholes,” he said. “We have a plan and we are making sure we have necessary materials to address the issues.”
