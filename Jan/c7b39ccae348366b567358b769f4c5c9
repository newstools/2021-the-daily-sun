THE selling of RDP houses continues to be a headache for Mpumalanga Human Settlements MEC Norah Mahlangu. This following the recent sale of a house at Sivukile in Standerton, Mpumalanga, doing the rounds on social media. Last year, two officials from the Steve Tshwete Municipality were arrested for selling RDPs. The MEC said the Housing Amendment Act permitted the selling of a house only after eight years. “RDP houses are built for disadvantaged people. If house owners want to sell, they must follow the right process and involve conveyancers. The sale of a house without lawyers causes problems for both the seller and buyer,” she said. “We recently had a case where an RDP house was sold to two different people by the owner.” Mahlangu said they opened a case of fraud with the police in Morgenzon. “We are very serious when we tell people not to sell houses unlawfully. We have involved the police as one of the key players in the newly formed RDP Fraud Management Committee that deals with the illegal occupation and selling of RDP houses and land across the province.” She advised people not to take short cuts trying to own property at the expense of government. Mahlangu said those who wished to report similar cases should use the department’s WhatsApp number 064 641 6333, or visit their nearest human settlements offices during office hours.
