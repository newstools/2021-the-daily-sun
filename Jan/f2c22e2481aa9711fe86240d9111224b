COUNCILLOR Mabhiza Mfamela said he feared for his life as there was a conspiracy to kill him. From Mhlontlo in the Eastern Cape, Mfamela claimed that he had received a recorded conversation between local traditional leaders and someone from Gauteng, planning to kill him by December. He said five other people were also targeted for assassination in the conversation. The trouble came after traditional leaders accused him of working with stock thieves and hiding them from the police. In a recording heard by the SunTeam, a man Mabhiza claimed was a traditional healer could be heard saying: “He tried to shoot me two times with bullets, but I survived and I saw him.” The man went on to claim that Mabhiza was one of the attackers before saying: “I want Mabhiza dead.” The councillor said the claims were not true, and he had never tried to hide thugs. “The allegations made in this conversation that I tried to kill the traditional leader are untrue. “They are trying to tarnish my name,” he told Daily Sun. “I am not safe at all. On 10 January, I received a call from an unknown person asking me about these things.” Mabhiza opened a case at Sulenkama Police Station in Qumbu. Eastern Cape police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni confirmed that a case was opened. “Various cops and state organs are handling the matter and the case is at an advanced stage. Due to the sensitivity of the matter, that is all we can disclose. The complainant was briefed timeously about the progress of the investigation,” Tonjeni said. Kubusi village, which was in the area the councillor represented, was a stock theft hot-spot. Last year, hundreds of villagers marched to the Qumbu Magistrates Court and called on the police to intervene.
