“JONAS was one hell of a musician!” This is what jazz legend Caiphus Semenya said about his friend and fellow musician, the late Jonas Gwangwa, who died on Saturday, 23 January. This was two weeks after his wife died. “He was hurt. I guess he couldn’t wait,” ntate Caiphus told Daily Sun. “I had been waiting for him to have tea, but he was called home.” According to the musician, the late jazz legend had a spine problem and was also diabetic. “I know it’s cliche but a piece of me has died,” he said. He said his friend hated being called by name by the younger generation. “It was ntate or mkhulu Jonas. ‘Who is Jonas?’ he would say. We grew up together from when we were about 14 years old. We worked and travelled together. We were in a group in America and we loved each other.” The Nomalanga hitmaker said he loved his friend’s sense of humour and positivity. “He always remained positive even in challenging situations. I loved his music and talent as he was multi-talented. He took risks and explored unknown territories in music until he got it right, including his work on his song Flowers Of The Nation. He took a wedding song and made it his own. “He was dedicated to his work and I remember when we decided to focus on making our own South African jazz and not follow the American trends, he dedicated his life to music.” Ntate Caiphus told the People’s Paper that ntate Gwangwa loved his family and lived for it. “People think because we are musicians we run away from our responsibilities but he loved his family a lot and lived for them,” he said. The iconic musician said his hope was for people to get flowers while they could still smell them. “Our people should appreciate people while they are still alive, ntate Gwangwa was a gentle giant and a very talented one,” he said.
