JONAS Gwangwa will be laid to rest tomorrow (29
January). His family said his funeral service will be streamed
live on YouTube. The service will be held at Christ King Anglican
Church in Sophiatown, Joburg, from 9am. Only the family and close friends of the legendary
jazz icon will be allowed to attend the funeral service due to the Covid-19
regulations which only allow 50 people to attend funerals. Gwangwa, who was 83 years old, died last week Saturday
23 January. This was the same day Hugh Masekela died in 2018 and Oliver
Mtukudzi in 2019. ALSO READ: JAZZ LEGEND JONAS GWANGWA PASSES AWAY! He will be honoured with a special provincial state
