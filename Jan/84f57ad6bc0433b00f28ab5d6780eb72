Admittedly, there are certain human organs that carry an unbearable pain threshold. Take a tooth for an example. Anyone who’s suffered the agonising pain of a toothache will tell you that it is one of the most excruciating pains humans can ever experience. The same thing can be said with headaches. Nearly every person has suffered from a headache and the general notion is that “a headache is a headache”. But according to health experts, there are different types of headaches: 1. Tension Headache If you have a tension headache, you may feel a dull, aching sensation all over your head. This can normally be treated by over-the-counter medication such as aspirin. 2. Cluster Headaches Cluster headaches are severely painful headaches that occur in clusters and are prominent between adolescence and middle age. Pain medication relieves this type of headache. 3. Migraine Migraine pain is an intense pulsing from deep within your head. This pain can last for days. The headache significantly limits your ability to carry out your daily routine. Treatment drugs such as Triptans help with severe inflammation and blood flow through your head.
