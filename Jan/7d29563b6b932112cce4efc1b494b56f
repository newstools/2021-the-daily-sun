CAPE Town City’s new striker, Justin Shonga, is delighted and hoping for happy days in the Mother City. Shonga jumped ship from Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TT) to The Citizens with the hope of finding peace in his mind. His acquisition was confirmed by City on Tuesday morning after SunSport  reported on Monday the player has flown to Cape Town to finalise a deal with John Comitis. The 24-year-old has only been with TTM for the past few months, having signed from Orlando Pirates in the off-season under a dark cloud. He played seven league matches and cup ties for TTM scoring a single goal with one assist for the duration of his stay. Shonga will now be looking to resurrect his career with the Cape Town club where he is a potentially replacement for Kermit Erasmus who has since moved to join Mamelodi Sundowns after scoring 13 league goals last season. But he will have to impress ahead of another potential in Fagrie Lakay who has scored a brace in the past weekend against TTM, as well as Tashreeq Morris and Ghanaian forward Prince Agyemang. Shonga said: “I would like to appreciate the chairman (John Comitis) for signing me. “I am happy, Cape Town is a good place. I am looking forward to fitting in with the team, have a good time, work hard, win games, as well as trophies with the team that have already had a good reputation in terms of winning. He added: “We will work hard for the people of Cape Town (fans) and try to achieve more. I am looking forward to the good days.” Shonga initially arrived at Pirates after signing from Zambian side Nkwazi FC. He spent three seasons at Pirates where he made a promising start before his form tapered off last season. In the 2017-18 season, he played 23 games for Bucs and scored four goals. The next season he played 35 matches and netted eight times. But last season, 2019-20, the Chipolopolo striker managed just 10 appearances and failed to find the back of the net.
