GOBELA Zanele Zuke was overjoyed when she was made professor on Saturday, in Isipingo. On top of this, her trainees had a graduation ceremony in the suburb south of Durban over the weekend. The Mhlabuhlangene School of Traditional Medicine awarded them with doctorates, meaning they could also work as gobelas. The well-known teacher at Isbani Sedlozi in Isipingo, said thwasas had to undergo extensive training. “I know traditional healers aren’t taken seriously because we don’t possess the same documentation as formal doctors,” she said. Zanele said it was important for sangomas to be certified in case they had to deal with the law. “It’s been 11 years since I started practising, and I’ve never been more confident about my gift,” she said. I POKE AND THEY FAINT! “I have never doubted it before and I’m glad I will be recognised by government. “When you train your children, you can tell where their strengths are, so I encouraged them to enrol at the Mhlabuhlangene school. “If a thwasa is good with muthi, they’re given assignments to learn about the scientific side of it. This isn’t part of what healers did in the past.” Graduate Sandile Sitole said he was very proud of his achievement. “I’ve never worn a graduation gown in my entire life, but today my ancestors blessed me and showed me they’ll be faithful if I continue to respect them,” he said. “This is a beautiful reward, and I’ll continue serving them tirelessly and pray for more.” The new sangomas were given practice numbers allowing them to do hospital referrals and give patients sick notes.
