SABC1’s reality show, The Gumbis, broke fans’ hearts last night when the season finale aired. The Gumbis usually trended number one every Saturday when it aired. The show, which follows businessman Lucky “SomK” Gumbi, his wives Bayede and Nombuso and their kids, took Mzansi by storm and set tongues wagging every week, with every episode. Before the show started, there was already drama with SomK and Musa Mseleku. SomK threw shade at Musa, who also has a reality show with his wives on Mzansi Magic. He said his wives got along, unlike Musa’s wives. Musa responded, saying he didn’t know SomK, so he shouldn’t meddle in his house affairs.

When the SunTeam contacted Tira about the claims, he said he didn’t know SomK and he’d like to apologise for whatever he did to him. Although SomK was the centre of attention, he wasn’t the people’s favourite. Most of the viewers loved his first wife, Bayede, and they said they hoped the show would return for a second season. In the last episode, they showed behind the scenes from the season, scenes that weren’t shown and went back to their favourite parts of the show.\  #TheGumbis I will miss them all!
