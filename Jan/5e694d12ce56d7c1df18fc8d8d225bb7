SWALLOWS FC coach Brandon Truter is in a rush against time to get his best soldiers ready for arguably their toughest battle of the season. The Dube Birds are preparing for a top-of-the-table clash with defending champions and fellow DStv Premiership log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (3pm). But Truter is worried that he might struggle to field his best team as fatigue and injuries are wreaking havoc in his side. Swallows only have 48 hours to recover from a gruelling match against Chippa United, which ended in a 1-1 draw at Dobsonville Stadium. Truter believes some of his players who played the entire match against the Chilli Boys will find it tough to fully recover for another huge test against the Brazilians. He reckons Downs will be the fresher team, having had the extra day’s rest and they also have the luxury of rotating their team without losing any quality, thanks to their squad depth. Swallows, on the other hand, do not have the same luxury and Truter is crossing fingers that star striker Ruzaigh Gamildien and midfielder Given Thibedi, who ran their socks off against Chippa, will shake off fatigue. He is also hoping that his captain Lebohang Mokoena recovers from a slight niggle to face his former team Sundowns. “Thibedi and Gamildien, as well as the back four, all ran 90 minutes against Chippa and that’s a tough ask for them to do it all again on Saturday,” said Truter. “But we look forward to it. The boys will be up for it. They have a strong mentality.” Swallows blew a chance to leapfrog Downs into first place in the Premiership as they were held by the Chilli Boys. Truter was bitterly disappointed, but is hopeful that his side will still topple Downs. “I was disappointed man, very disappointed,” added Truter. “The result wasn’t what we wanted. I’m disappointed that we let it slip and we did not score the extra goal that we needed.”
