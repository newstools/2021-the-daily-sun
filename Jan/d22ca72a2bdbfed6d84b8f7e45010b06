NEW Black Leopards assistant coach Lehlohonolo Seema dismissed talks that he joined Lidoda Duvha to replace under-pressure Dylan Kerr. Seeing that the team is struggling, Lidoda Duvha boss David Thidiela appointed Seema to assist the Englishman and his deputy Morgan Shivambu last week. “I have been having a good time and have settled well in Limpopo for the past few days I joined Leopards,’’ said the former Orlando Pirates captain. “The management and the technical team have welcomed me with open arms. Kerr is a good guy with experience. I want to learn from him. He has been in the game for a while. I have a good relationship with him.’’ The former Lesotho international has been a professional coach for four years. Seema made a good name as coach at Bloemfontein Celtic last season. But he left Celtic in July to join Chippa United. But his stint at Chilli Boys only lasted for five months as he managed to collect only five points from eight league games. Leopards under Kerr, who rejoined the Venda-based side last year in November replacing the sacked Belgian coach Patrick Aussems, has won only one match, lost two and drew two. And now it remains to be seen if the partnership between Kerr and Seema will work. Leopards travel to Durban to face Golden Arrows in their first 2021 DStv Premiership game at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium tomorrow (5pm). This is the first clash the two coaches will be sitting together on the bench in their bid to help Lidoda Duvha move away from the relegation zone.
