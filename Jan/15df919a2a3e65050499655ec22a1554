IT’S do-or-die! That’s how Bloemfontein Celtic coach John Maduka has described their next DStv Premiership match against Stellenbosch FC. The clash, which will reveal a lot about Celtic’s season according to their coach, will be played at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Saturday (3.30 pm). Phunya Sele Sele are desperate to return to winning ways having struggled for points of late. The Mangaung outfit’s poor run has seen them go winless in their last five matches in all competitions. This has seen them slide to 11th place on the standings with nine points from 10 matches. Maduka is concerned by this and has challenged his players to respond in their next outing against Stellies. “It’s a must-win game, no excuses,” said Maduka.“We have found it difficult away from home but this time we have to use our home advantage. “We will have to go all out and try and ensure that we win that game and get maximum points.” Maduka doesn’t necessarily feel his side have been performing badly, he reckons it’s just the luck that has eluded them. They have dominated the bulk of their games but failed to convert their chances. The 2-1 defeat to SuperSport United last time out was especially hard to swallow for Maduka as he believes they were the better team. “I think we played well, it was just unfortunate that we conceded the goals on set-pieces,” said the 50-year-old Malawian. “We could have done better in those instances. But I believe a loss was not a true reflection of the game. “We controlled so many moments but we were not sharp enough in the final third to score the goals. “But we knew that our opponents were strong on set-pieces and that’s essentially how they benefited. “It’s frustrating to lose a game like that, we played one of our best games but we walk away empty-handed.” Stellies will not be an easy opponent for Celtic having tasted defeat just once in their last five outings. They currently sit comfortably in seventh position with 13 points from 10 matches.
