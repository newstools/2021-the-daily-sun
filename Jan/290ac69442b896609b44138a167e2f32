THE Department of Basic Education’s director for examinations, Priscilla Ogunbanjo, has announced that all exam papers will be marked. She said that includes the papers of pupils implicated in the leaking of Mathematics paper 2 and Physical Science paper 2! Ogunbanjo said although all papers will be marked, the results of those with irregularities will be blocked until a proper probe has been done and finished. Speaking in Tshwane today, 20 January, she said: “All pupils who’ve been found with irregularities will be called to a hearing and after the investigation, if they’ve been cleared, their results will be released.” Ogunbanjo was joined by the department’s director-general, Mathanzima Mweli, who gave an update on the progress of the 2020 National Senior Certificate examination marking. He thanked markers for their sterling work and unions and SGBs for their supportive role and assistance shown to the department throughout the process. He said marking had been concluded and centres were closed in most parts of Mzansi. In the Free State and North West, most subjects had been completed and the rest should be concluded by Thursday, 21 January. “With Western Cape most subjects had been completed, and 12 remaining papers will be completed by Friday,” he said. He was positive all centres would finish marking before the cut-off date on Friday. With marking concluded ahead of schedule, they were now capturing marks and preparing for standardisation.
