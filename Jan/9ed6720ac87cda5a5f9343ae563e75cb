YOUNG people gathered outside their local cop shop on Wednesday, 6 January to demand more action be taken to solve rape cases. Co-founder of #LangaForMen, Siyabonga Khusela, said: “We have many rape incidents here. “But most people decide not to open cases because they’re told to go to Bishop Lavis Police Station. “Langa cases aren’t taken seriously there. Our wish is for our station to start attending to these cases.” Another co-founder, Luyolo Lengisi, said the police station had promised to work with them in the past. “We live in Langa. If we’re told to go to another police station, how are we going to get help fast, without the evidence getting lost?” he said. Luyolo said the’d been complaining about the same problem for years. “People are not aware there’s a specialised rape case team in Bishop Lavis. We also don’t have taxis going there.” A resident, who didn’t want to be named, said many of them had lost their jobs due to Covid-19, so they didn’t have transport money. “Where are we supposed to get money to go to Bishop Lavis? Why can’t they deal with the cases here?” Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said Langa Police Station was being helped by the Bishop Lavis sexual crimes unit. She said when rape cases are opened in Langa, cops call Bishop Lavis staff to come fetch the docket. If a minor is involved, a detective from Bishop Lavis is sent to take a statement. “If victims were told to open cases in Bishop Lavis, they must lodge a formal complaint with management at Langa for the allegations to be investigated,” she said.
