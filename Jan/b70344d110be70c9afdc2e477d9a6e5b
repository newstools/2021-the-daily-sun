WHEN Florence Mokoena tested positive for Covid-19, all she could think of was isolating herself. She didn’t realise that thinking of others would lead to her losing her job. The pregnant 31-year-old mum of three from Blood River, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, said she was fired when she returned to work on Thursday, 14 January. This was even after showing her manager the test results from hospital. “I was told to leave the premises before security could come deal with me,” she said. Florence said she started feeling sick while at work. “My boss wasn’t around and I had to tell someone else that I wasn’t feeling well,” she said. She said the colleague told her boss, who said she could leave but without getting paid for the day. “I went straight to Seshego Hospital, where I was tested as I was showing symptoms. “I tried to call my manager and sent several SMSes, but he didn’t respond.” Florence said when she finally got hold of her manager, she promised to send the papers through an SMS, but he demanded physical copies. “After my isolation period, I went to work with the papers,” she said. “Unfortunately, I didn’t find the manager so I gave them to the colleague he left in charge.” Florence said the woman sent the papers to her manager, but she later received a call from him telling her to leave the premises. “The manager’s treatment shocked me because I was fired for no reason,” she said. The South African Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union’s Elvis Moraka said the matter was taken to the CCMA. But when the SunTeam contacted labour department spokeswoman Lerato Makomane, she couldn’t provide any comment except to say it’s a CCMA matter.
