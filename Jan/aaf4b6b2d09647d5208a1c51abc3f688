YOU kids will only stop going to the river the day someone dies. That was the chilling warning Xolani Cethe (17) gave the group of kids who’d invited him for a swim at a stream just outside their kasi in Snake Park, Soweto. Sadly, Xolani was the one who died a few days later after he drowned a hero on Friday, 22 January as he was trying to rescue a nine-year-old who was allegedly pushed into the water. According to Xolani’s aunt, Nonhlanhla, (40) he got stuck in muddy water in the stream after he jumped into the water. She said attempts by one boy to rescue him failed and they couldn’t pull him out. Xolani’s mum, Phumzile, (37) said her son often went to the stream with other kids, but what they knew is he never swam but observed from the banks.  “He got in to save the young boy,” said Phumzile. She said she’d looked forward to great things as her son would have matriculated this year, and he’d be remembered as a hero and respectful child. Nonhlanhla said they were called to the stream by men who live in the area to alert them to Xolani’s accident. When they got there a search for Xolani had already began. “We looked and even prayed for hours without finding him. After a while someone spotted him and they took his body out.” The family hoped parents reprimanded their kids and stopped them from going to the stream. They hoped the area got cordoned off. Captain Kay Makhubele said the police had opened an inquest docket following the death of a 17-year-old boy.
