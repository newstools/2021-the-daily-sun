PETROL prices are set to spike significantly in February. The Automobile Association was commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. The AA expects petrol to rise by up to 82 cents a litre, diesel by 59 cents, and illuminating paraffin by 60 cents. According to the association, South Africans are once again vulnerable to Rand weakness. “Unfortunately, our mid-month concerns over the advancing oil price have been borne out in practice. There has been a slow but steady rise in the price of oil, which is likely to cause ongoing pain at the pumps. “Almost all of the fuel price increases reflected by this month’s data are attributable to the stronger oil price, and the average Rand/US dollar exchange rate has remained generally flat for the month, despite some large daily swings,” the AA said The AA notes that the Rand dropped to an all-time low of over R19 to the dollar last April and the currency has since appreciated to approximately its pre-Covid-19 level.
