LIFE is throwing stones at many futureless men, while giving comfort to those living their dreams. Many men above the age of 40 have nothing in life, and are still seeking employment. Some have temporary jobs, while others have never been employed. At 40, as a man, you are need to have achieved many things such as a steady relationship, house, children and investments for their education, retirement plans and more. But, unfortunately these men are still moving around industries and roadsides looking for their first jobs. It is known that in South Africa, some careers exclude those above 35. These include soldiers, police, traffic officers, bank tellers and receptionists. That shows you that as you grow older, the chances of getting a job gets slim. I feel sorry for these men in their late 40s and 50s looking for a job. I know that some have already thrown in the towel, and instead abuse alcohol just to pass time. On the other hand, ANC members, together with their families and friends are enjoying luxurious lives at the expense of many struggling South Africans. I feel sorry for many of our futureless brothers who have nothing. Their life is like a blank page because they have not achieved much. Government should put older men ahead of the youth because they need to fulfil their dreams before they reach retirement age, unlike young people who still have the advantage.
