THE opening of the Department of Development Planning offices has been postponed. This after two employees died from Covid-19. Development planning spokeswoman Poppy Louw said the officials had worked in the Land Use Development Management directorate. “We’re truly saddened to have lost such valuable members of our staff, who served the department diligently. “They will be missed by all their colleagues and friends in the City of Johannesburg,” said. Louw said certain plans were postponed, and they asked the public to be patient with them. The city has sent condolences to the families and friends of the officials. “The Department of Development Planning has extended its support to the families of the deceased officials, as well as members of the staff who have been affected by the unexpected passing of their colleagues,” Louw said. Due to the extent of the loss, the department postponed the opening from 6 January to 13 January 2021 to allow staff members time to undergo counselling, and give the department an opportunity to prepare itself to serve efficiently. Louw encouraged all officials to continuously adhering to Covid-19 precautions.
