Beer Association of South Africa is pleading with President Cyril Ramaphosa to lift the blanket ban on alcohol from 16 January. CEO of the association, which is made up of the Craft Brewers Association, Heineken and SAB, Wendy Pienaar said it was necessary to lift the ban to ensure the survival of small business owners. Pienaar said the third ban on alcohol sales had a devastating impact on the craft brewing industry. “We have been inundated with calls from members who’ve been left depleted of their savings and reserves and are now in desperate need of financial relief if they are to survive.” Pienaar said it had become a question of whether business owners, their employees and families would have any food to eat this month. She said the craft brewers stepped up during the hard lockdown last year by feeding more than two million hungry people while also manufacturing sanitisers.  Lethu Tshabangu, owner of Ukhamba Beerworx which opened a new taproom at the V&A Waterfront last year, said he was R300 000 in debt. “We need to fight Covid-19 without starting other fires. You don’t bring a snake into your home because you have a problem with rats. “The government has condemned my livelihood and those of my employees, whose jobs meant a great deal to them as they have families to feed,” he said. Brewsters Craft owner Apiwe Nxusai-Mawela, the first black woman to own a brewery, said she had no idea how she’d make it through the ban. “I’m hoping we can reopen in order to make a few sales so that we can at least pay our employees.” According to the association, the beer industry lost almost 7 400 jobs, R14,2 billion in sales and cost the government R7,4 billion in taxes and excise duties. The association said the current 9pm to 6am curfew should remain in effect along with the 8pm closing time for businesses.
