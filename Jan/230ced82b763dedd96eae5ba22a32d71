THREE minors testified in the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane in the murder trial of Thoriso Themane on Thursday, 28 January. The three state witness are part of a group of accused who allegedly attacked Themane (28) on 23 February 2019. Themane died in hospital the following day. One minor told the court they followed Themane to his hiding place after assaulting him. He said: “I also participated in the attack and started taking three video clips of the incident.” Six minors who can’t be identified and two adults, Alfred Mothapo (36) and Chuene Maleka, (37), are on trial. They’re accused of attacking Themane in Flora Park, Polokwane, after accusing him of stealing a cellphone belonging to one of the minors. The attack sparked a protest after the video clips went viral. The court heard the testimony of another accused-turned-state witness. He took the stand and implicated all the suspects. He described how they chased a bleeding Themane as he tried to escape. A 17-year-old accused died in March 2019 after he was stabbed several times at a tavern in Seshego. Video clips, pictures, DNA and postmortem reports were handed to court as part of the evidence. The trial will continue until next Friday, 5 February.
