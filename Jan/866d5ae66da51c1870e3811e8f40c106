PERCY Tau could finally realise his English Premiership dream! Indications at Anderlecht are that the Bafana Bafana midfielder is edging closer to a move to his parent club, Brighton & Hove Albion. Tau hasn’t kicked a ball for Brighton since he signed with the Seagulls three seasons ago, and was shipped out to Belgian sides, Saint Gilloise, Club Brugge and lately Anderlecht. But thanks to the new Brexit rules, the 26-year-old enterprising midfielder could finally don the blue and white colours of Brighton. Under the new rule, Tau can obtain a work permit, which proved a stumbling block previously. The former Mamelodi Sundowns star has recovered from a muscle injury which laid him in the sickbay since November. Even though he is back to full fitness, he hasn’t joined Vincent Kompany’s training squad at Anderlecht as he reportedly hankers for a move to the Seagulls. “I would very proud to play in the English Premiership,” said Tau. “People from my country are always looking out for players who compete in the big divisions across Europe. “We give hope to the next generation of players in South Africa. It helps them to have something to aim towards. I’m grateful that Brighton were able to sign me from SA.” Tau has started the season in fine form for Anderlecht, scoring four goals in 14 matches. He won the Belgian Pro League with Brugge last season and also had his first taste of Uefa Champions League football. He collected invaluable points while playing in Europe’s top club competitions – the Uefa Champions League and Europa League - as he looked to satisfy the strict English work permit requirements.
