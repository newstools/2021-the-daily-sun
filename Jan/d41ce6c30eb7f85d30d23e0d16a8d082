WESTERN Cape Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz has accused Police Minister Bheki Cele of being on a power trip. Fritz said Cele is obsessed with the province’s beaches. “The Western Cape government believes the rule of law in SA must always be upheld, and regulations be enforced even if we disagree with them,” he said. Fritz said it was clear from Cele’s media tour he was more passionate about arresting surfers than dealing with gang leaders on the Cape Flats. “This is also confirmed by his latest public utterances that soldiers will be deployed to beaches on the Garden Route where, by his own admission, adherence to regulations has improved.” He said Cele’s visits redirected policing from communities experiencing high crime levels. “Of course, all regulations need to be enforced until struck down by a court of law, but it would do the minister well to broaden his focus from beaches and zone in on that violent crime many of our communities experience,” he said. Resident Luyolo Mjuza said Fritz was right about Cele. “We all want to fight this pandemic,” he said. “But the minister needs to put more effort and time into things that will change our communities.”
