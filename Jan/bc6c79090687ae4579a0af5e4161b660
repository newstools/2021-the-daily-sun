THEY are lookalike dancers who confuse fans with their looks. Tumelo “Chillibite” Makgamatha (27) and Lesedi “Lesmahlanyeng” Kgatitswe (26) told Daily Sun that when they were on stage, people thought they were twins. The two international dancers from the Pretoria CBD, who call themselves the Yellow Twins, said they created the Thuso Phala Dance in 2018 and Jerusalema last year. Chillibite said they started the Jerusalema dance last February in Paris, France. “The song, released by Master KG and Nomcebo Zikode in 2019, was brilliant but had no dance routine. “We’re proud to be pioneers of the Jerusalema dance. Our moves gave the world hope and unity.” The dancers, who have been dancing for 10 years, said being a good dancer took persistence. They met in 2015 while dancing for King Monada in hit song Skabora Moreki, and have performed in countries such as France, Portugal, Angola, Botswana and Senegal. Even with a lot of female attention, the two are still single. “At some performances in Durban women threw bras on stage and even proposed,” said Chillibite. He told the People’s Paper that in Zambia in 2018, he was kissed on stage by beautiful women. They can also sing, and have released the single Sergeant Sputla with Team Mosha in October. They plan to release a love song called Feeling, featuring Mr Brown and Meryl on 14 February. The talented duo is also planning a Corona dance. Next month they will be touring Tunisia, Israel and the United Kingdom. They have performed for Drake, and Master KG and Nomcebo.
