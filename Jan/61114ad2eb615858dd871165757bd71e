THIS much-loved kasi twerker isn’t interested in marriage, even though men beg her all the time. Koketso “Ms Trendy” Ramogayana (27) from Soshanguve block FF in Tshwane said bigshot businessmen want to marry her. “I know when I did my moves during my twerking dances, no man could resist me because I was so hot,” she told the SunTeam. Some men couldn’t control themselves, she said confidently! Ms Trendy was a member of a twerking group called Twerkstars in 2013. She left twerking in 2015 because it was taking a lot of her time. “I’m passionate about life. I don’t believe in limitations. Even today I can still twerk – and I am still hot!” she said. She told Daily Sun she’d often make R10 000 on a busy day. One of the reasons the twerker is rejecting proposals, even from rich men, is that she already has someone in life. “Money isn’t everything. Happiness in a relationship is important. When men see my beautiful body they go crazy. That is why they are interested in me. Just that.” Men always want to take selfies with her. And her message to them? She’s no magosha! “Whenever I’m in malls and other places women feel insecure about their men. I’m not a homewrecker,” she said. “I still have a beautiful body, but I’m not interested in other women’s men.” She understands rich men want her to twerk for them and become a trophy wife. “No! That will never happen,” she said She teachers children how to twerk. Ms Trendy also gives women tips on how to spice up their sex lives. “I’m a confident woman and have good moves,” she said. “I’m an intelligent woman and have everything a man wants. “From cooking, cleaning and tutoring, I know how to keep men happy.” She was bitten by three pitbulls in 2012, and doctors had to put skin draft on her right arm and left thigh. Last year she completed a diploma in civil engineering at Tshwane North College. She owns mobile Trendy Beauty Spa and Unique Trendy Hair in Soshanguve.
