DOZENS of families in eMkhonjeni in Jozini, northern KZN, had to be evacuated after their houses were flooded by heavy rain. Sandile Gumede (35), from one of the affected families along the river bank, told Daily Sun: “There’s a small bridge that diverts rain water away from our homes. But when there’s heavy rain it overflows and water floods our houses.” She said her two-roomed house, which she shares with her two kids and three nephews, was flooded. “When I realised water was getting into the house in full force, I called a neighbour from up the hill to come help me take the smaller kids to her home, which is safer.” She said they’d sleep at a neighbour’s house for as long as it continued to rain. Ward councillor Vusi Gumede confirmed they’d evacuated some families. “But we’re happy nobody was injured. All the affected people are safe,” said Gumede. Meanwhile, a house in the Abaqulusi Municipality in Esilweni Village collapsed and injured two people. It’s alleged the injured were immediately taken to hospital and have since been discharged. Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka called on residents in northern KZN to exercise caution. “Since Sunday, heavy rains have been reported in uMkhanyakude and in parts of the King Cetshwayo and Zululand districts,” said Hlomuka. Disaster management teams had responded.
