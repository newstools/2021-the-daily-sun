Manchester United's bid to win the Premier League for the first time in eight years will face a major test when the leaders face champions Liverpool on Sunday. With points certain to be dropped by one of the title contenders at Anfield this weekend, third-placed Manchester City can climb back into the race. Slumping Chelsea have been forced to put their own title ambitions on hold after a woeful run that must be arrested soon to take the pressure off boss Frank Lampard. UNITED READY FOR LIVERPOOL TEST After unexpectedly gate-crashing the title race with nine wins during an 11-match unbeaten run, Manchester United head to Anfield knowing they have a golden opportunity to open up a potentially priceless six-point lead over Jurgen Klopp's men. For the first time since Alex Ferguson's title-winning farewell season in 2012-13, United are top of the table at this stage of the campaign. They hold a three-point cushion over second-placed Liverpool after Tuesday's success at Burnley -- a far cry from the 30-point gap the Reds had opened up over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side when they last met in January 2020. Having made their worst home league start to a season in 48 years, United were in turmoil when they suffered a shock Champions League group stage exit. But Solskjaer, who appeared in danger of the sack, deserves credit for dragging United back into contention and a first win against Liverpool since 2018 would be the perfect way to show their challenge is more than a flash in the pan. United have won seven league games on their travels this term, while Liverpool -- ravaged by defensive injuries and suddenly short of goals -- have gone three league matches without a victory. "They're champions by right and we're looking forward to it and it's a great test of where we're at against a good team," Solskjaer said. -AFP
