MARITZBURG United coach Ernst Middendorp sometimes over thinks the team’s tactics. It showed on Saturday when his team didn’t hurt Orlando Pirates in the dangerous areas in the first half with what looked like a 5-3-2 formation. While that system and supposed to be a flexibility tactics, they couldn’t come out and it was only in the second half where he went with a 4-4-2 formation. Things look better and Maritzburg troubled Pirates' defence led by captain Happy Jele and Thulani Hlatshwayo. But then, Pirates had scored through Deon Hotto who bundled the ball home in the 40th minute after the Team of Choice were caught on transition. It was second league loss on the bounce for Maritzburg after losing 3-0 in the previous game to TS Galaxy at home. “In the first half we were not really competitive. I think that was a bit surprising for me,” said Middendorp. “The number of players for me are far to the level where we can be and I don’t know if it’s a pressure on the back or (fatigue) of having played three games in six days. But the changes we made going into the second half, we were competitive. “We were better in dominance and I believe we should have shown a better drive in the final third in terms of decision making. We could have done better to get probably the equaliser.” Following this defeat, Maritzburg remain third from bottom of the table with nine points from 13 games. However, they have a whole week rectify their shortfalls as they visit Middendorp’s former club and unbeaten Golden Arrows side at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium this coming Saturday. “We got days to process our recovery. We have Clayton Daniels and Sanisa (Bongokuhle Hlongwane) who got knocks (against Pirates) and a number of players who are out injured,” he said. “Under this circumstance, it is very crucial that we have an entire week in front of us.”
