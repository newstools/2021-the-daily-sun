Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) will play host to SuperSport United in a DStv Premiership match at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 3pm CAT (SA, GMT+2). Vhadau Vha Damani's woes continued on Tuesday when they lost 3-0 to Kaizer Chiefs away and they are now winless in eight matches in the league. The result left Tshakhuma placed 16th on the league standings - three points behind 10th-placed AmaZulu FC. Joel Masutha, the Tshakhuma head coach, has admitted that lack of consistency when selecting his starting line-up has hurt the team following their defeat to Chiefs. "We are trying. But every match or every week, we are bringing in players, and you need consistency," Masutha said. “If you check our last five games this year, there are a lot of changes. Also, you need that understanding among your defenders. "So I think that is our main undoing. We will soldier on, and we will try to rectify it.” Meanwhile, SuperSport extended their unbeaten run to eight matches in the league when they drew 1-1 with AmaZulu at home on Wednesday. The draw saw Matsatsantsa remain third on the league standings - two points behind joint leaders, Mamelodi Sundowns and Swallows FC. Kaitano Tembo, the SuperSport head coach, is expecting a tough match against Tshakhuma in what will be the first-ever meeting between the two teams in the league. "Another tough game, it is always a difficult place to go to and playing at three o'clock [3:30 pm] in the afternoon in the heat," Tembo said "It becomes a little bit difficult for the players. But I think we will recover and refresh and make sure that we go there with the right mentality. "We need fresh legs. It is what we are going to need." -SuperSport
