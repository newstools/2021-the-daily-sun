Yes, we have to social distance and keep our masks on. I’m sure with the alcohol ban things are going to go down. But I don’t hear a lot of government officials calling for us to pray. I feel that we need God more than ever at this point in time,” Kelly shared. The talented star said she knew that people would call her crazy, but she was standing by her words. “Again, I know a lot of you will certify me as a crazy person. But again, I feel like I need to ask you guys to call on the Lord because no scientist is going to create a miracle at this point. We need God Himself,” she continued. Shared post on Time
