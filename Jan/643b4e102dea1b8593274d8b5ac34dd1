UNDER pressure Joel Masutha has vowed he will not resign as Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach as he believes he can turn around the DStv Premiership rookies’ fortunes. Tshakhuma's form has been poor. They have now gone eight straight league matches without a win and have dropped into the relegation zone. And rumours are Masutha is not happy with the club management with the way they have been running things as it is affecting his job and his team's performance. “I am not happy as we are not getting results like any other coach would do,” said Masutha. “But despite that, I am positive that we can turn around the corner soon. We have a quality team which is capable of getting away from the position we are in. It has been tough but we will get it right.” In Tshakhuma's 3-0 defeat against Kaizer Chiefs in a league clash at FNB Stadium on Tuesday, a source told SunSport that it was a member of his technical team and not Masutha who replaced Meshack Maphangule for Aluwani Nedzamba. “Masutha is not happy with what management did against Chiefs,” said our source. “Masutha felt he was disrespected and wants to have a meeting with club boss Masala Mulaudzi to get answers on what happened against Chiefs. He was unhappy after the game. It remains to be seen what will transpire from that meeting." “Things are bad at Tshakhuma. Some players are owed money, and Masutha is trying his level best to make sure the boys play despite their problems with management. "On the other hand, the players are concerned about their future as it has been reported that the club is up for sale. So it remains to be seen for how long Masutha will continue as a coach under this difficult situation.”
