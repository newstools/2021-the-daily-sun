Actress and singer Nandi Madida was at a loss for words this week after she received a gift from superstar, Beyonce Knowles. This comes after she starred with her in the film, Black Is King, last year. Nandi said after she auditioned for her role, Queen B insisted on working with her. She was dragged on social media for these claims, with many accusing her of overstating her importance.

Love, Beyonce,” reads the gift wrap. Nandi, who’s married to dance music producer Zakes Bantwini, was grateful and humbled. “Thank you @Beyonce and the Parkwood team for the beautiful gift, forever grateful and humbled to have been a part of such a great project and working with inspiring people.
