PERCY Tau played a key role to help Brighton & Hove Albion beat Blackpool 2-1 in the FA Cup on Saturday. Tau lasted for 60 minutes on the pitch and was replaced by Neal Maupay. Brighton goalkeeper Christian Walton was delighted to make his first Albion appearance in six years. The 25-year-old keeper’s last appearance for the first team came in May 2015 – a 0-0 draw at Middlesbrough. “I was saying to my family it’s something like over 2 000 days since I last pulled on a Brighton shirt – it’s quite strange really!” Walton said. “Seven loans later and I am back in a Brighton shirt. It’s a great feeling. “I came back in the summer in a good position, I injured my ankle in the Chelsea friendly and it’s taken me a little bit of time to get back fit, but yesterday was really good for me. “I have been in the gym and working on things you don’t usually get to do when you’re playing every week, which I have been for the last three years.” Walton has played in all three tiers of the EFL on loan and he is now aiming for a first Premier League appearance. “My main aim is to play in the Premier League and compete with the other two goalkeepers at the club – the competition in the group is very healthy. “I hadn’t really worked with Robert [Sanchez] that much because I’ve been out on loan, but you can see he’s got quality. He’s a young goalkeeper and it will take him time to become a Premier League goalkeeper because it doesn’t just happen overnight. It happens over a course of a couple of seasons. “The team have had positive results the past few weeks. We played well at Manchester City and we beat Leeds so it’s good that Rob has been involved in that. It shows that the manager is willing to give opportunities to players that are doing well.”
