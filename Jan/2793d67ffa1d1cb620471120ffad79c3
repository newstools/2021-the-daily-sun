THE people of Jordan in Phola Park near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga are worried about their loved ones graves. This is because the graves are at risk of getting washed away or damaged whenever there’s heavy rainfall. In addition, residents said the street leading to the graveyard is no longer driveable. They have now asked the municipality to fix the storm water drain in the area. Resident David Masilela (49) said: “The situation at the graveyard is appalling. The fence is damaged because of floods. The water comes running down from the top and is very strong. “Mourners find it very difficult to drive into the graveyard because of the damaged street. “The ward councillor knows about the situation, but nothing is happening. Storm water drainage should have been built a long time ago.” Another resident, Bathabile Kabini (34), said her relatives’ graves were right next to the street. “I can see trouble is looming as the graves are in danger. “A donga caused by floods is slowly closing into the graves. “I don’t think my family can afford to fix the graves if they become eroded,” she said. Vusi Mtsweni, who owns a funeral parlour, said it would be difficult to have burials at the graveyard if the situation was not urgently addressed. “The street is damaged and we will soon have to carry coffins into the graveyard and leave the hearse far,” he said. Thembisile Hani municipal spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane Mokoka said they would send officials to assess the situation. “The relevant department will see what can be done once we get a full report before more damage is done,” she said.
