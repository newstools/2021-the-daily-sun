SOMEONE close to them apparently wants their blood for evil deeds. Maskandi artists, Amanda and Andiswa Dlamini, received death threats from unknown phone numbers. Amanda said they were told their manager, Scelo “Inkosi Yabefundisi” Ngcobo, wanted to use their blood for ukuthwala. “This would help him become rich and famous in maskandi circles. From what we’re told, our blood would make strong muthi as we’re twins.” She said the threats started in December shortly after they were signed under his record label. “When we told him about the anonymous calls, he took us to his home in KZN and showed us he’s not rich, and that he lives a simple life,” she said. “Our debut album is supposed to be out in March. He’s the only one who’s shown interest in our work. We don’t know what to believe, but our lives are in danger. We’re desperate to be in the music industry. They’ve not opened a case, but told their parents. “We’re seeking advice on what to do next,” she said. Inkosi Yabefundisi was aware of the allegations. “I’m a child of God. I’m not going to use the twins for ukuthwala. I don’t kill people or use muthi. I have no doubt my enemies are behind this,” he said. Last month, Daily Sun reported that an inyanga called Mkhulu Incushe threatened to kill Inkosi Yabefundisi if he didn’t keep his sacrifice. Asked about this, he said: “I met the inyanga and we agreed I’d pay whatever I owed. I gave in to his demands because I experienced bad luck after 14 days. “One day my car burned in the front, and that’s when I realised things were getting hectic.” Mkhulu Incushe said: “I sent my tokoloshes to attack him after 14 days. Within a few days he came back crying. He’s started paying. But he asked me not to tell the media. As for the twins, I’m not the one calling them.”
