MAMELODI Sundowns star Gaston Sirino has spoken for the first time since his proposed transfer to Egyptian giants Al Ahly failed to materialise. The Uruguayan has been out for a while. He missed the past nine games of the 2020-21 DStv Premiership. At the time his club Sundowns was in talks with Ahly for the services of Sirino. However, the two clubs failed to reach an agreement. Sundowns then released a statement stating that Sirino will be staying at the club as he is contracted until 2025. The 29-year-old have accepted the failed move and turns his focus on helping Sundowns. He made his first league appearance this season when Sundowns played against Baroka FC. “I feel happy to be back in the side after being away for a long time,” Sirino told the club website. “It’s a great feeling to come back and help the team with an assist or a goal whenever I can and I just want to go out and work hard for the side.” Sirino who played a key role last season when the club won a treble, is aiming for more success in the league and Caf Champions League. He said: “This season we just want to make sure we keep the standard from last season and bring more accolades to the club. “We want to dominate the league and go further in CAF Champions League, it is a cup where we come up against very good teams and we do have the players that can go out there and win the cup.” On Saturday Sundowns will be hoping to continue with their unbeaten run in the league when they face Swallows FC in the top of the table clash at Lucas Mmoripe Stadium, (3pm).
