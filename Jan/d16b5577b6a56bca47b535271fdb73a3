A SECURITY guard accused of raping a colleague will only know if he will be granted bail later this month. The man’s application in the East London Magistrates Court was cut short on Friday, 22 January because of a power outage. It was postponed to Thursday, 28 January. The man, a supervisor at a company contracted by the University of Fort Hare, allegedly raped the victim on 2 July last year. The woman reported that the man, her supervisor, asked her to have sex with him. She refused and he raped her! He allegedly also threatened to fire her if she denied his request. He’s been in custody since 28 December. Before the postponement, Magistrate Linda Magaxeni was informed that the accused intended pleading not guilty. The court heard he was sentenced to 20 years for rape 20 years ago, but the sentence was reduced to five years on appeal. It also emerged he had a sexual assault case pending. He acknowledged appearing in the Mdantsane Magistrates Court for the sexual assault case. The accused claimed the woman who accused him of rape was a former girlfriend, but they’d never had sex. He said they broke up last year. The accused said he didn’t understand why he was only arrested in December when the alleged incident happened five months earlier. He said during the relationship with the accuser, he took photos of them together but deleted them because he has a wife.
