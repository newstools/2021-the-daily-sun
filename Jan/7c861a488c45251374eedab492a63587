TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila coach Joel Masutha is optimistic that his charges will start the New Year on a high note. Masutha’s lads are set to start the 2021 with a tough clash against Steve Barker’s Stellenbosch FC in their DStv Premiership encounter at the Danie Craven Stadium tomorrow (5pm). The former Black Leopards coach was speaking to SunSport yesterday morning at Makhado where his side was doing their final touches before they travel to the Mother City. “I was worried that the players might come back from festive holidays not fit but I am impressed with the way the boy has looked after themselves,’’ said Masutha. “I have a full squad which is fully fit and ready to start this new year with positive results. We have a fully team without injury or problem of Covid 19.’’ But Masutha has also warned his players to expect a tough clash against Stellies. “I have studied them through watching their games this season and they are a good team which you need to be at your best if you want to get results from them in their backyard,’’ he explained. “If you look at their home games this season, I think they played three and only lost one. So it tells you that they are a tough side to beat in their backyard. They have quality players like Mark van Heerden, Robyn Johannes, Jayden Adams and Phathutshedzo Nange.’’ Stellies are ninth on the log with nine points from nine league games. On the other hand, the PSL rookies are 10th with only a point behind Barker’s team. Tshakhuma are coming to this clash from a 1-1 draw with their Venda foes Black Leopards in their last league last year while Stellenbosch drew 2-2 with bottom side Maritzburg United.
