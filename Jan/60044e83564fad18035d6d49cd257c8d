The department would work closely with institutions to prepare for the start of the academic year between March and mid-April. “While the current focus is on the completion of the 2020 academic year, I will provide further information on plans for 2021 at a later stage, following engagement with the institutions and the release of the matric results.” It was critical to ensure necessary health and safety regulations were in place.

He said the second was a vaccine trial. “In partnership with the South African Medical Research Council, the department is co-funding a study, led by the University of the Witwatersrand, aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 in South African adults living without HIV, as well as safety and immunogenicity in a small cohort of adults living with HIV,” he said.
