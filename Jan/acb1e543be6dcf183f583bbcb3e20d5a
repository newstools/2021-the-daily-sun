FORMER Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus has admitted to the concerns about the standard of rugby in the Carling Currie Cup. But in the same breath, he has defended the integrity of the extended Super Rugby Unlocked tournament, which has come under question from analysts. The tournament enters it's last-four stage this weekend, with the big franchises, Bulls, Lions, Western Province and the Sharks in the semifinals. Ex Boks coach Nick Mallet and Peter de Villiers, as well as former assistant coach Swys de Bruin, have been openly critical of the standard of play. But Erasmus, who is the SA Rugby director of rugby, has explained the Covid-19 disruptions have affected the quality of the tournament. “I fully get what people are saying about the product on the field,” Erasmus said. “When people mention ball in play, it’s our jobs, we do just that. We analyse guys week in and week out. Every day Jacques and the coaches analyse how many cleans, how many tackles they have made. Every player gets rated on how far they are off the Springbok team. “So, we see the stats as we go along and see the problem that the ball in play is down. We talk to the teams and find out what is going on. “Everybody knows that there is a 25- or 26-minute ball-in-play time. It’s not rocket science to find that out. Every single player knows his actions from a match. He knows how many tackles he made. We are rating these players to get them ready for Test matches against the British & Irish Lions and the PRO16. We ask these questions.” The Bulls will host Lions at Loftus Stadium in the semifinals (2pm). The Sharks travel to Newlands in Cape Town for the second semifinal against Western Province at 4pm. The finalists will battle it out for honours on January 30.
