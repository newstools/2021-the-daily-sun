SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo says the formation they are using now is working in favour of Thamsanqa Gabuza and the powerful striker’s play is benefiting everybody, which has led to the team challenging for this season’s DStv Premiership title. Gabuza has been used as the main man upfront and his striking partner Bradley Grobler behind him to pick up the loose balls. The former Orlando Pirates striker’s presence was felt on Saturday as, instead of doing his usual hustling work, scored twice as SuperSport thrashed TS Galaxy 3-0 at Mbombela Stadium. The goals came in quick successions as Gabuza took advantage of Galaxy’s slack defending to punish Zipho Dlangalala’s struggling side. Grobler added the third for the Tshwane giants. It was Grobler’s record equalling goal as he’s now tied at the top of SuperSport all-time scoring charts with the late Abram Raselemane on 57 goals. “I think we are using Gabuza to his strengths because he’s strong aerially and he can hold the ball very well for us,” said Tembo. “We allow Bradley to play around him and that makes it difficult for opponents to plan against Bradley because Gabuza is doing all the hard work.” While Gabuza’s two goals made it four for him this season, Grobler extended his scoring feat this season to nine, one ahead of Themba Zwane, who netted his eighth when Mamelodi Sundowns beat Baroka FC 2-0 also on Saturday. To score the two goals in the opening five minutes allowed SuperSport some breathing time to settle in the heat and play with freedom, compared to the previous game against Chippa United where Tembo was left livid at the end as they drew 2-2. “Afterwards, it was all about managing the game and I think we did that very well,” said Tembo whose side cemented their third spot on the table. “We were very compact, we were narrow and we put pressure on the ball, we caught them on transition a lot of times. With little of luck, we could have scored more goals.”
