IN encouraging news, daily coronavirus infections were below the 10 000 mark on Monday, 18 January, an improvement from last month. The second wave brought the nation’s daily infections to more than 20 000 over the past week. On Monday, the daily national infection rate was sitting at 9 010, with 344 people succumbing to the virus. More than 1,3 million positive cases have been identified in Mzansi, making it the African country with the highest cases of the virus. The vaccine is expected to arrive before the end of this month. Health department deputy director-general, Dr Anban Pillay, said that they’re in talks with the Serum Institute of India regarding vaccines. “We’ve been reaching out to the institute since September,” Pillay told Daily Sun. “It said it would be able to give us a million doses in January and 500 000 units in February. “We don’t have the exact date yet.” The vaccine would be transported by aircraft, and the country would receive a seven-day notice before the vaccines were loaded onto a plane. Pillay’s department was hoping to first vaccinate frontline workers starting on 1 February, and has given itself three months to do so. He told the People’s Paper: “We want to make sure we cover healthcare workers before moving to the next category of high-risk people. “It’s important to appreciate that the vaccines other countries procured may not be ideal for South Africa.” Pillay said using the Pfizer vaccine would have been problematic in Mzansi, because of the cold storage that it required. “The Ministerial Advisory Committee advised us against using that vaccine, and we agreed that it would be a problem to roll it out, particularly in summer,” he said. “That’s why we opted for other vaccines such as AstraZeneca.”
