THE Cape Town International Jazz Festival has been postponed again. This is the second time the popular festival that was going to be headlined by some of Mzansi’s AND THE WORLD’S biggest stars has been put on hold. Musicians such as Lira, Judith Sephuma and Something Soweto were on the line up. Earlier last year after the coronavirus outbreak, the organisers postponed the event to the foreseeable future. But now they’ve announced they are postponing until next year, 2022, in light of Covid-19 safety concerns. In a statement festival director Billy Domingo said: “The decision to postpone the 2020 Cape Town International Jazz Festival in March was one not taken lightly and made in the best interest of our valued festivalgoers, sponsors, and corporate clients. “This decision was accompanied by an optimistic view to host the festival once again in 2021. Sadly, we currently find ourselves in the midst of a dreaded second wave of Covid-19 infections, the impact of which, by all accounts, we will feel deep into 2021.” ALSO READ | DEATH BREAKS HEARTS He said the health and safety of everyone involved with the festival is of paramount importance. “It is for this reason that we have decided to postpone the festival to 2022.” Billy said they were working on bringing online events for jazz lovers. “JazzFix will be formally launched early in the new year,” he said. “The online shows present footage of some of the festival’s greatest moments and shows exclusively performed at the festival over the past 20 years, which includes interviews with artists who performed.”
