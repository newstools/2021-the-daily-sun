Gogo Nowhite Dlelani (58) from Brown’s Farm in Philippi knew her son had made a bad choice to be involved in drugs. She did everything to help him but all her efforts failed. On Thursday morning her worst nightmare became a reality – she found out he was dead. “He was no longer staying at home but with his friends. He would come to eat and he’d leave. I knew that the path he had taken would not take him far. It was just a matter of time until he was killed,” said Nowhite. Her son Luyanda “Lunga” Dlelani (22) was stabbed to death, allegedly by his friend early on Thursday morning while he was sleeping next to his girlfriend. It was the girlfriend who told Nomawhite what had happened. “She told me that he was stabbed by his friend around 2am on Friday (8 December) but she didn’t tell us what led to that. She said he was stabbed while they were sleeping,” she said.  Nowhite said her son has been doing drugs for the past three years and she did everything to take him back to the right path. “I tried everything I could do as a parent to change his ways but he was adamant. He dropped out of school, then I took him to Eastern Cape to study there but he came back. At his new school, the teachers said he was causing serious problems before he left,” said Nowhite. Nowhite said he didn’t have an ID and he had to dragged him to get it with the hope that he will get a job, but he never looked for work. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed the incident. “Gugulethu police have opened a case of murder following a stabbing incident that occurred in the early hours of this morning at 1st avenue, New Cross Roads in Gugulethu. “According to information, police attended to the crime scene at the address and upon their arrival, they found the victim with a stab wound. He died on the scene due to injuries. The suspect is yet to be apprehended,” said Rwexana.
