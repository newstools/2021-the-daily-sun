FORMER Kaizer Chiefs star, Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala’s days at AmaZulu could be numbered! SunSport has reliably learnt that AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy wants the 36-year-old midfielder out of the club. But it does not appear that McCarthy will easily get his way. There has been speculation that Tshabalala, who joined the club last October, is close friends with Usuthu president Sandile Zungu. When he was unveiled as an AmaZulu player, Tshabalala, made it clear Zungu is his friend. “Benni doesn’t want Shabba in the side. “He feels he’s not doing things freely because Shabba is close to the president,” said SunSport’s insider. With that being the case, it is said that McCarthy is not in control of everything and wants Shabba to leave the club immediately as he’s surplus to his requirements. But AmaZulu spokesman Brilliant Mkhathini has denied McCarthy wants Tshabalala out: “There’s no such thing. “The coach is working with all the players like everyone else. Shabba is being considered accordingly.” Since McCarthy joined Usuthu last month, he has not fielded Tshabalala. The former Bafana bafana midfielder made his AmaZulu debut against Golden Arrows on 16 December, playing only seven minutes under former interim coach Allan Freese. However, McCarthy recently said Tshabalala was in isolation after he previously tested positive for Covid-19 along with Sibusiso Mabiliso. But the 21-year-old left-back, who missed the game against Maritzburg United on 17 January, is back in the side and has played the last two games against SuperSport United (1-1) and this weekend’s 2-0 win over Baroka at Peter Mokaba Stadium. McCarthy has changed things and brought in his own people since he arrived. After Freese was shown the door, long-serving Davis Phiri, who was the club’s goalkeeper coach, also left. The former Cape Town City coach brought in Moeneeb Josephs, Siyabonga Nomvethe and Vasili Manousakis as his assistants.
