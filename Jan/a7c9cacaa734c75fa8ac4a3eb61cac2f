I don’t understand why parents leave buying uniform and stationery to the last minute. Parents who buy now avoid long queues and have the advantage of getting what they want and some on cheap prices.  Late shoppers have to wait to be served and stand a chance of not getting items. There’s absolutely no reason why schoolwear shopping shouldn’t be done now. Come January, school material will have become very expensive. Clever parents buy uniform in December to avoid the chaotic early January rush and the long queues. Parents and their excited children should try to get uniform shopping out of the way. The very wise activist, Malcolm X, once said: “Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.” So, use the money to replace those torn socks and worn-out shirts and pants. Many parents stress over what their kids are going to wear on Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve, forgetting about the kids’ schooling needs. Please make your children’s needs a top priority by buying school uniform on time. Letter by Norman Maake Tembisa
