Nota Baloyi is at it again, and this time his target is Cassper Nyovest. Nota, Kwesta’s former manager, has taken a jab at the Good For That rapper. Over the past year the cultural commentator’s mostly bad opinions about South African rappers drew a lot of attention. In a lengthy post on Instagram on Sunday, Nota wrote how Cassper had fallen and that Focalistic had taken his position. Nota said the hip hop community helped Cassper with his Fill Up concept, but he changed on them. “We, the SA hip hop community, came together to get Cassper from the Dome to FNB and, instead of him seeing how far we could get together, he instead wanted to act as if he got us there on his own, as if he didn’t need the hip hop community to progress in his career anymore,” wrote Nota. He said Focalistic was taking Cassper’s space in the hip hop space. ALSO READ | MKHANYISELWA LIVING HIS DREAM Nota said: “He thought he could do it without us. He was wrong and now he’s watching the hip hop community get behind Focalistic and the rest of the new school, which makes him jealous because he can’t stand not being the centre of attention.” He said Cassper needed to deal with his fragile ego. “You can’t help him. Don’t even try. You can always trust him to always want to make himself the pathetic victim, like he’s doing again now. Don’t fall for it. Don’t let him confuse you,” he said. Nota advised young rappers to unite so as to be successful in their careers. “We’ve done our part and you’re in charge now. All we’re here to do is give ya’ll guidance, but it’s in your hands, like it was in our hands when we were your age. “You young guys need to come together and build on what we’ve left behind for you.” Cassper hasn’t responded to Nota’s post yet.
