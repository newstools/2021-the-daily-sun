Western Cape Transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela has sent his condolences to the family of a farmworker who died in a crash in Worcester on Monday, 4 JANUARY. The accident happened when a truck driver carrying 37 people lost control, leaving the farmworker dead and 12 others injured. The injured were all rushed to hospital! “Preliminary reports suggest the driver had pulled up to the side of the road to make way for another vehicle when the accident happened. “I urge drivers, especially truck drivers and drivers of the vehicle transporting essential service workers, to make sure the combined weight of their passengers doesn’t exceed 50% of the total vehicle-carrying capacity,” said Madikizela. He said workers must be spaced in order for them to maintain social distancing to avoid the spread of Covid-19. “Our thoughts go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the deceased, and I wish the injured a speedy recovery,” he said. Madikizela said he’s worried by the number of pedestrians dying on Western Cape roads.
