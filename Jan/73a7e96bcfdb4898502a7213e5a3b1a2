The body of a 13-year-old boy who drowned in the Umgeni River in Durban was recovered on Thursday morning. According to Arrive Alive, the teenager had gone missing on Wednesday, which prompted a search-and-rescue mission. Police divers, search-and-rescue units, metro police and the Durban K9 Unit were deployed to look for the teenager. The police air wing also assisted by dropping the divers, who landed on a narrow rock slab alongside the river. "Sadly,
 the body was recovered and airlifted to the staging area at the 
Mzwamandla Khanyile Primary School, where it was handed over to members 
of KwaDabeka SAPS," the organisation said. - Compiled by Alex Mitchley News24
