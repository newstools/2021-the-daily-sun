TINY Kgapane thought her problems were over when construction on her RDP started. But five years later, the 47-year-old from Las Vegas Village in Ga-Kgapane, outside Bolobedu in Limpopo, is still waiting for a roof. Tiny said she and her nine children were forced to stay in two rooms after the subcontractor failed to build the roof. “It pains me every day when I see the unfinished house. “Sometimes I think it would have been better if construction never started,” she said. Tiny told Daily Sun the contractor finished other RDPs in the village. “I don’t know why this is happening to me. I really need this house,” she said. “I feel like people are taking advantage because I have no one to fight for me.” Tiny told the SunTeam she was forced to use some of her children’s grant money to buy corrugated iron sheets to roof two rooms so they would have somewhere to live. She said she was sent from pillar to post when she asked for help to get the house completed. “We have big problems when it rains because the roof I’ve put up leaks. “I’ve tried my best to get help, but I’m now tired and I’ve lost hope.” Greater Letaba Municipality DA councillor, Timothy Maluleke, said seven other RDPs in the area had been left unfinished. “We won’t rest until the houses are finished,” he said. Limpopo human settlements spokesman, Motupa Selomo, told the People’s Paper he’d investigate once staff returned from their holidays on 15 January.
