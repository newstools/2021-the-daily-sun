EVEN though Covid-19 infections and deaths have eased, the City of Cape Town is urging residents to continue following safety regulations. Health MMC Zahid Badroodien said burials had decreased, but the demand for spaces on Saturdays remained high. “Although burials remain high at 180% of interments before the pandemic, a slight ease in demand reflects the downward trend in the rate of infection. While this is good news, I encourage residents to remain cautious and not let their guard down,” he said. Badroodien said in the week ending on Sunday 22 January, there were 622 burials and 18% were confirmed Covid-19 deaths. He said 161 occurred at Maitland cemetery. “There were 231 cremations recorded in the last week at Maitland Crematorium, 45 of which were confirmed Covid-19 deaths. “This is an increase in cremations from the 198 recorded the week before due to cremators coming into operation mid-week last week.” He said with extra capacity available for use, the city expected that more cremations would be processed daily to ease backlog. “It is important to be mindful that while the city’s increased capacity at the crematorium, this is still insufficient to meet the normal 72-hour turnaround time on cremations due to extraordinarily high demand at present.”
