PASTORS from Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane today drove through the kasi, playing loud music, reading from the Bible and praying for God’s intervention. The pastors said their community was struggling with many things and being a Covid-19 hot spot in Tshwane had made matters worse. “We understand that the government is trying to get things in order but closing churches doesn’t help because people need spiritual help to get through life,” said pastor Ditshaba Maloka. The pastors urged the residents to follow the government’s instructions in fighting the coronavirus, but to continue praying. Maloka said murders, divorces and death rates were up because people weren’t praying.  He said he hoped the prayer drive would help to give residents strength in these difficult times. Apostle Lettah Qoka said Ga-Rankuwa became a hot spot because of the lack of adherence to the protocols set by President Cyril Ramaphosa. She said they needed to pray so that the residents followed the rules to avoid the spread of the virus. “We are taught from the Bible to follow our leaders. We have failed to do that and that has created the problem we are facing today,” she said. “We hope that these prayers will get into the people’s hearts. “We believe that everything will soon be back to normal,” she said. One of the residents, Martha Nkoana, said this was a great initiative and it was needed in their community. “What these pastors are doing is good because they are our leaders and when they speak, we will listen. They are reminding us to pray,” she told Daily Sun.
