WITH the country in the second wave of Covid-19, the men and women in blue have been out on the streets to make sure citizens are adhering to lockdown regulations. Operation Okea Molao took place at a roadblock in Evaton, Ekurhuleni, yesterday. It took only eight dumpies of cider in a cooler box to secure the arrest of a man in his 40s during the police’s roadblock. The man was in disbelief as he was cuffed and walked to the police car. Dressed in what looked like running gear, the man told the cops he was on his way to the gym. Several vehicles, including minibus taxis, were impounded on the spot for expired license discs while some drivers had no discs at all. The drivers of the unroadworthy taxis were ordered to reimburse their passengers so they could catch other taxis. In the second phase of the operation, cops pounced on a chop shop in Vereeniging where two confirmed stolen vehicles were found. Some parts, which were stripped from suspected cars, were also found on the premises. Major-General Tommy Mthombeni said: “This operation was indeed a success as we found two motor vehicles, positively identified through microdot technology. As you can see this place, there is a problem with not complying with the Second Hand Goods Act.” He said since the engines and other parts are not marked properly, the manager of the scrapyard was bust and fined for failing to comply with the rules around second hand goods.
