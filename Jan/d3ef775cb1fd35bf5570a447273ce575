FORMER Safa president Mluleki George has passed away. George succumbed to covid-19 in East London on Tuesday. George served as the first president of Safa during the unification of South African football that was then splintered in four federations and on racial lines. Each federation had its own constitution and president. An anti-apartheid activist and politician, Mr George spent five years on Robben Island as a political prisoner and was one of the founder members of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in 1983. Mr Georgeâ€™s involvement in sport spans decades. He served with distinction as President of the Border Rugby Union and later became Interim Chairperson of the South African Football Association. He also served as President of the National Sports Council. On the cricket front, Mr George was a leading participant in the process of the unification of cricket. His passing is a loss to cricket in particular and the sporting community in general.
