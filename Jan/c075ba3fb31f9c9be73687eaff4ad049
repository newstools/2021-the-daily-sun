FORMER Baroka captain Gerald Phiri Jnr is appealing to his teammates to wake up and smell the coffee or else they will find themselves fighting for relegation this season. The Malawian international was speaking following Bakgaga's disappointing 2-0 defeat against Benni McCarthy's AmaZulu in their DStv Premiership clash at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.  "I think we have no one else to blame for this defeat but ourselves," said the 27-year-old.  "We were not in the game on Saturday. We can to this game full of confidence but we did not play our normal game. Truth is if you look at the game, we were not were to be found. We did not play according to the coach's plan and you cannot do that against a quality team like AmaZulu. I think is time we look at ourselves and pull up our socks while is still early. We started the season well and we put a huge fight in our 3-2  win against Stellenbosch last week and what happened on Saturday was dissapointing and we need to regroup and get back to winning ways. We have a good coach Matsimela Thoka and quality team and we can move up on the log and fight to end the season at a good position. I think is time we start to be consistency."  Baroka captain Elvis Chipezeze also share Phiri sentiments:" I think it was just that day which things did not go our ways. We struggled a lot but this things happened in football. All we have to do now is to move on and work on our mistakes and focus on the coming game against another quality side Kaizer Chiefs on Tuesday."  This win for Usuthu was the Bafana Bafana legend's  second since he took over the helm at the KwaZulu Natal based side last month.  AmaZulu's two goals that helped them travel back to Durban with three points was scored by their want-away striker Bongani Ntuli and Siphelele Magubane.  This win has seen AmaZulu moving to eighth spot with same 15 points with Baroka who are two positions behind them on the log.
