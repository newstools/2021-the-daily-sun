AT the end of December, Sassa suspended a total of 210 778 disability grants after their extension period expired. Sassa spokesman, Paseka Letsatsi, told Daily Sun the agency had extended temporary disability grants that were supposed to lapse last February to December. This was to help grants beneficiaries during lockdown. “The inconvenience caused by the suspension of temporary grants, particularly at this time, is acknowledged,” he said. “However, compliance to laws and costs have informed this challenging decision.” Letsatsi said paying the grants cost more than R1,5 billion, and paying them until end of March would have cost an extra R1,2 billion, which wasn’t available. A disability grant can be awarded as a permanent grant, which is subject to medical review from time to time, or a temporary grant in cases where disabilities temporarily impact people’s ability to work. “If the grant lapses and a person is still unable to work, they must apply for an extension. “The reapplication requires a new medical assessment, which will confirm whether or not the condition warrants a grant.” He said affected South Africans should report to the nearest Sassa office with a detailed referral report from a doctor to confirm the impact of a medical condition or disability. “It’s important for any applicant for a disability grant to be aware that if the grant is awarded for a temporary period, or if it’s not approved, he or she has the right to request Sassa to reconsider the decision,” said Letsatsi. “This must be done within 90 days of being informed of the outcome of the application.”
