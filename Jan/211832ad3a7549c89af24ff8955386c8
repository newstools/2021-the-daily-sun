JOBURG Metro police are teaching people about the coronavirus and staying safe. They have been talking to passengers and taxi drivers about Covid-19 and safety at Bara taxi rank in Soweto. Marshals have been checking that everyone was being sanitised and haven’t been allowing anyone not wearing a mask to enter the taxis. Superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun the Metro cops’ community outreach about the importance of road safety also involved taxi drivers, passengers and pedestrians, since Bara was one of the big taxi ranks. Minnaar said people were coming to Soweto from rural areas and holidays. “It’s important that we ensure everyone is safe and we all start the new year on a positive note. “We emphasised the importance of wearing a mask during this pandemic and the implications of not wearing one.” Minnaar also reminded commuters and drivers to wear masks and to sanitise. “Breathing under a mask might be a bit difficult, but we have to follow all safety precautions,” he said. The SunTeam also spoke to taxi drivers, who said they made sure all their passengers were sanitised before they got into a taxi and ensured they were wearing masks. Said Ntsizwa Mbatha: “We don’t want to put anyone’s life at risk and we also hope people take these safety precautions seriously.”
