MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach Rulani Mokwena sees nothing special about their Saturday’s top-of-the-table clash against high flying Swallows FC. The highly anticipated encounter is set to take place at Lucas Moripe Stadium at 3pm. The Brazilians and Swallows are heading to this clash both tied on 26 points each team after 12 matches in the DStv Premiership, only separated by goal difference. “It’s just another one of 30 (games) and it is a game that we have to win,” said Mokwena. “The opposition is good, the team has a winning momentum. If you win the NFD (GladAfrica Championship) and you come into the PSL, you come into the PSL with a winning feeling, a winning momentum.” Both these teams are yet to taste defeat this season. However, in midweek they both dropped valuable points when they both played draws. Sundowns failed to extend their lead at the summit when they were held to a goalless draw by Bloemfontein Celtic, while Swallows drew 1-1 with Chippa United. Mokwena said this is a match they need to win, as they failed to get maximum points in their last two league games. Mokwena added: “It’s a game we understand clearly that we have to play very well to win.” “Every game Sundowns play, play to win. We play Barcelona, Sundowns plays to win, we play Black Leopards, Sundowns plays to win, we play Cape Town All Stars, Sundowns must play to win, we play Black Poison, Sundowns must play to win. “Every game Mamelodi Sundowns must play to win... focus and clear adherence to the targets and the goals we have set for ourselves. If we stay true to that, we should be okay.” Sundowns are going to this encounter without some of their players who are injured. Mokwena revealed: “Nascimento,(Ricardo) medically we're without (Lyle) Lakay, medically we're without Bangaly (Soumahoro) and for medical reasons we are without (Khuliso) Mudau. "And we were dealt a huge blow by losing Brian Onyango with a grade two thigh injury that sets us back a little bit.”
