SPORTS minister Nathi Mthethwa has paid tribute for late  Boxing pioneer Lawrence  “Slow
Poison” Nzondo. Nzondo who hails  from East London was
one of the first boxers from the then Cape Province to turn professional in
1965, as part of the ‘Group of 4’ that included the likes of Alesta Mahashe,
Stanley Toni and Cornet Dunjwa. Reflecting on the role that
“Slow Poison” played, Minister Mthethwa said, “He was a model professional, a
disciplinarian, a family man and an absolute credit to the Boxing fraternity. He will always be remembered as one of the pioneers of professional boxing in
our country during the dark days of apartheid, giving our people hope and
inspiration”. Nzondo, who fought in the
Featherweight division throughout his career and later crowned Cape
Featherweight Champion, was known for his relentless body attack, fighting
behind a jab, and using the defensive  “shoulder roll style” later
perfected by the likes of former WBC Super Middleweight Champion, Thulani
“Sugarboy” Malinga. He is also credited with mentoring the late legendary
boxer, Nkosana “ Happy Boy” Mgxaji. A good heart has stopped beating; a good
soul has ascended to heaven. We extend our deepest
sympathies to the Nzondo family, friends and the sporting fraternity at large.
May his soul rest in eternal peace.
