KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has issued a challenge to his players ahead of the Soweto derby this weekend. The Glamour Boys are preparing to renew their rivalry with Orlando Pirates. The iconic clash will take place at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Hunt, who does not have happy memories in the derby, wants his side to change that. Chiefs head into the third derby of the season a different team from the one the Bucs humiliated 5-0 over two legs in the MTN 8. Hunt seems to have stabilised things in Naturena and put their early-season struggles behind them somewhat. Chiefs are unbeaten in their last five matches having won three and drawn the other two matches. They are just four points adrift of Pirates who currently sit in fifth spot on the log. Their recent improvement has largely been thanks to the return from injury of top striker Samir Nurkovic and the fine form of youngsters Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Happy Mashiane. Hunt has challenged the rest of the squad to ‘raise their hand’ and show that they belong at the club. “I believe in the players we have but they certainly need to do better there’s no doubt about it,” said Hunt. “Everyone is in the shop window with me, they need to put their hands up and show that they want to play for this club. “But we are taking it one game at a time and keeping expectations down."
