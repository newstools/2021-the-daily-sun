The portfolio committee on Home Affairs will visit Beitbridge and Lebombo border posts next week. This is after the chaos that erupted at these port of entries leading to people spending days on the queues while waiting to be processed. Chairperson of the committee Advocate Bongani Bongo said his committee is concerned and will visit to see what’s on the ground. “The committee was concerned by the conditions people faced at these borders which posed both humanitarian and health risks, this visit will be used to interact with the departments operating at the ports of entry to ascertain if resolutions have been found to challenges faced at these sites,” Bongo said. Bongo said both Beitbridge and Lebombo ports cater for huge numbers of people and vehicles and they are key to Mzansi's trade operations. He added that it was “alarming” that such important ports were faced with these kinds of challenges. “ It is in this context that the committee will ascertain if solutions to cumbersome queues and on the lack of health documentation have been found,” he said. The committee will first visit Beitbridge border post between Mzansi and Zimbabwe on Tuesday 12 January. They will visit Lebombo border on14 January. At the peak of the festive season between 20 and 30 December truckdrivers and travellers reportedly died while on a queue that was stretching more than 10 kilometres. Bongo said they will have time to interact with travellers and also to ascertain whether employees at the border are equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE). The Border Management Authority (BMA) was signed into law last year in August and was meant to make border operation effective. Bongo said they will be asking the Department of Home Affairs on why it is not being implemented. “We have always been of the view that the BMA will be a vehicle by which challenges faced at the ports of entry are resolved, thus we need to ascertain progress in establishing this agency,”  Bongo said.
