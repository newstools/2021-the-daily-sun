MUSICIAN Masedi Ramolefo was excited to see his friend on TV. But little did he know his friend had betrayed him. The 22-year-old Limpopo artist said he used to record songs with his friend, Prince Benza. But he was shocked when he saw Prince performing their song Ngwaga on SABC1’s Lockdown House Party on Saturday, 16 January. However, Masedi’s part on the song was sung by Matorokisi hitmaker, Makhadzi. Masedi said he was shocked and confused with what he saw. He said he immediately called his friend after the show to find out what was going on.

People liked it.” Masedi said they agreed to work on a remake and include more artists.  “But we didn’t work much because of lockdown. I was shocked to see he worked on our song without me and removed my vocals,” he said. Masedi said he helped to write the lyrics and deserved to be given credit and featured on the song. “It broke my heart he didn’t show any remorse when I confronted him. “Instead, he dared me to do whatever I wanted,” said Masedi. When Daily Sun contacted Prince Benza, he confirmed that he first recorded the song with Masedi and that his vocals were removed for promotional purposes. “The song was not complete when we performed it at the Lockdown House Party. “But we will release it this month and he will be credited. His vocals will also be included. I tried to tell him this, but he doesn’t want to understand,” he said.
