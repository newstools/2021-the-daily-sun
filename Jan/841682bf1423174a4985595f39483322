METRO FM presenter and new mum Pearl Modiadie has given her baby daddy the boot. Pearl broke up with Nathaniel Oppenheimer, the father of her son Olivier, last month while others were celebrating the festive season. According to sources, she was no longer happy with the relationship and wasn’t coping with the pressure of being a mum. “Pearl decided to end things with him because she was no longer feeling happy and wanted to focus on being a good mother to her child,” said a source. “Things started falling apart between the couple a few months after the baby was welcomed into the world.” A second source said Pearl felt overwhelmed and not properly supported. “As a new mum, she wanted some kind of support from her partner and he did give her that but she felt it was not enough.” A third source told Daily Sun: “Pearl’s decision to end things with her baby daddy wasn’t a sudden move. It was a thought out decision because a child was involved. She didn’t just wake up and decide to leave.” In happier times, the former Zaziwa presenter flooded social media with photos of her partner but she recently posted on Instagram that being alone is better than being unhappy. The SunTeam contacted her but she refused to comment.
