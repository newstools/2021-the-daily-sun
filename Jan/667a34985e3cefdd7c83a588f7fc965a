“EVEN though it’s not advisable for residents to take the law into their own hands, we believe it can make a positive difference.” These were the words of a CPF chairman after a day of chaos. On Sunday, residents of Jozini in northern KZN moered one suspect to death and torched two cars in the KwaJobe area. The suspects were allegedly caught with computers and laptops stolen from various schools in the area. CPF chairman Joseph Ngubane said 10 suspects were bust after four schools were burgled. “We’re not condoning brutality, but sometimes it seems like it’s the only language thieves understand.” Joseph said he was hopeful residents had sent a strong message to other thieves in Jozini. KZN education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said: “As much as we don’t condone residents taking the law into their own hands, we’re happy they’re showing they’re fed up with criminals who break into schools.” KZN police spokeswoman, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said residents noticed two suspicious cars parked near a school in the middle of the night. “They mobilised and managed to bust six suspects aged between 24 and 43. The suspects were assaulted and one of them, aged 35, died on the scene. The other five were handed over to the police with injuries.” Gwala said residents set the two cars used by the suspects on fire. “It was established that the primary school in KwaJobe was broken into. The fence of the school was cut and doors were damaged,” she said. “Charges of murder, attempted murder, malicious damage to property and burglary were opened at Jozini cop shop.” Gwala said the police were given information about another car with unknown occupants that fled and headed towards Mbazwana. “Police stopped the car. Five computers, two flat screen TVs and housebreaking implements were found.” Five suspects, aged between 21 and 32, were bust.
