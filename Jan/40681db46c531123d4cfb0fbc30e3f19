Grade 12s will be getting their results next month and I’m pleading with them to accept the outcomes as they are and move on. This comes with a lot of stories like pupils killing themselves. Whether you’ve passed or failed, be prepared to see matric as just one part of life. Suicide must never be an option. Parents can take your failure, but suicide is too bitter a pill to swallow. Those who won’t be happy with the outcome are not out of options. Passing matric is the first step on your road to your dream career, but candidates must be encouraged to embrace the results with grace. Results don’t always represent one’s full intelligence. If you have failed, don’t despair because there’s so much to live for. Letter by Nelson Kgatla, Pretoria North
