DESPITE publicly praising the ANC Integrity Commission, President Cyril Ramaphosa has privately blasted the commission for leaking a report that he was not co-operating. Over the weekend, Ramaphosa told reporters he welcomed the criticism levelled at him for not appearing before the commission for 18 months. The commission has reportedly been trying to get him to appear, verbally and in writing, but he apparently insisted on involving lawyers. Ramaphosa said: “I would say yes. They were correct to chastise me because that in itself proves they’re independent. They will not say this is a president and we shouldn’t have said that.” In an angry letter that did the rounds on social media on Monday, 11 January, Ramaphosa wrote that he had explained himself to the commission regarding his campaign funding to become ANC president. Ramaphosa complained he was under the impression it had been agreed between him and commission chairman George Mashamba that the matter would be put on ice until legal issues were resolved. “What concerns me is the impression that is created, which would appear like I was delinquent in the manner in which I dealt with the matter of my appearance before the IC,” he wrote. “I’m therefore surprised that the chairperson’s report asserts that it is with ‘great disappointment’ to the IC when the president explained to the chairperson that since this was a legal matter, he did not feel it was right to discuss the CR17 campaign funds until the legal matter was finalised. “My intention in making the proposal was by no means aimed at avoiding my appearance before the IC. In fact, the opposite is true.” He disputed Mashamba’s statement that the commission had been pursuing him for 18 months. He was only aware of correspondence twice: in 2018 and in 2020. He’d phoned the commission to say he was ready to appear and submitted a document detailing his campaign.
