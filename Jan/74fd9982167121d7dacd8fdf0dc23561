It’s a good thing for daughter-in-laws to help with household chores, but this doesn’t mean mum-in-laws have to force them! The reason men get married is to start their own families, not to have their makotis slave-driven. Tradition doesn’t imply daughter-in-laws should be forced to do a pile of household chores without being given time to rest. The truth is that the human rights of most daughter-in-laws have been violated from time immemorial. The tendency to burden daughter-in-laws with a pile of household chores – while mamazalas and their lazy daughters sit on their behinds the whole day – is annoying and needs to stop! I POKE AND THEY FAINT! Wifely duties are not only confined to doing the bidding of mother-in-laws but to starting their own families. It’s irrational for mother-in-laws to treat their daughter-in-laws as if their sons married them to be their slaves. It’s saddening to see some of them making it hard for their daughter-in-laws to adjust to married life. Some irrational mum-in-laws, as if their sons married them to be their slaves, go to the extent of forcing their daughter-in-laws to perform household chores. Unwillingness or failure to oblige usually results in wholesale victimisation by the extended family or, even worse, vilification by the mamazalas’ neighbourhood broad-daylight, nightgown-wearing posse. Evidently, it’s important that they treat their daughter-in-laws with kindness and love. Forcing them to stay on their toes the whole day, as if they’re not made of flesh and blood, is a resoundingly evil act. Daughter-in-laws are human beings, too, and they deserve to be treated with respect and be accorded some semblance of dignity. Shame on all mother-in-laws who treat their daughter-in-laws as if they exist to do the dishes and clean the house.
