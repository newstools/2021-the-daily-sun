The department of Correctional Services in Mpumalanga has launched a manhunt after a 25-year-old prisoner escaped from the Nelspruit Correctional centre today. Madumbuque Acacid Agastirho escaped while out cleaning the terrain of the prison. Ehlanzeni Correctional centre communication manager, Messiah Hlungwani said, Agastirho escaped from the facility at about 12H10. I POKE AND THEY FAINT! "The escapee is a Mozambican national, sentenced to 90 days for being in the country illegally. The department is working with the police to re-arrest the escapee," he said He further urged the public to immediately contact their nearest police station and never attempt to institute a citizenâ€™s arrest as Agastirho is now regarded to be dangerous. "The department of Correctional Services remains concerned about any escape and continues to strive towards the ideal standard of zero escapes," he said Investigations of how he escaped are underway.
