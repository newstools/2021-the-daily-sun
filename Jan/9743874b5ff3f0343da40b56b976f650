OLE Gunnar Solskjaer has drafted in club legends Roy Keane and Ryan Giggs to the training camp to help inspire his side towards a title charge. The Norwegian boss, who was close to the sack in October, has overseen a dramatic turn of form that will see Manchester United move three points clear at the top if they win their game in hand over Liverpool. Three months ago they endured a dismal 6-1 home defeat to Tottenham. In November, United were embarrassed by Istanbul Basaksehir and were later knocked out of the Champions League. But they are now seven games undefeated ahead of tonight’s EFL Cup semi-final with Manchester City. And the Athletic write how changes at their Carrington training base have coincided with their revival. One of those is by inviting Keane and Giggs to speak to the younger players to help inspire them and “create a family feel” around the club. Keane, now a pundit on Sky Sports, played 480 times for the Red Devils and won 12 major trophies. Ex-Welsh winger Giggs won a stunning 22 major trophies during his illustrious career at Old Trafford. Solskjaer’s former United teammate Darren Fletcher has also been promoted to a first-team coaching role. The boss said of the appointment: “Darren has the United DNA running through his veins and he knows exactly what it takes to be a Manchester United player. “He is at the start of his coaching career and his experience both on and off the pitch, along with his winning mentality, commitment and hard work, will be a great addition to the staff.” The report adds how the club have also overhauled the backroom staff to take a more data-driven approach. There has also been an emphasis on the rising stars with the youngsters playing above their age groups. X THE SUN
