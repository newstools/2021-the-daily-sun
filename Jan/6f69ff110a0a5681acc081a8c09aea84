In life we have people who prefer self-service outlets. From self-catering hotels to staying alone at holiday resorts, these people can easily be deemed as self-centred. Now, as life coaches would often say: The greatest gift is loving yourself and this sentiment is shared by autosexual beings. By definition, autosexuality means people are more attracted to themselves than to others and may prefer masturbation to sex with a partner. According to experts, it doesnâ€™t mean that someone who is autosexual will never have sexual relationships with other people. It simply means people who are autosexual feel more sexually aroused by themselves rather than by others. Experts further reveal that we all have autosexual tendencies. Like other sexual orientations, autosexuality can exist on a continuum. Some may have sexual desire for themselves, enjoy self-stimulation, have sexual dreams about themselves, and fantasise about themselves to the exclusion of other relationships. Experts conclude that others may have these qualities but can also be romantically and sexually involved with one or more partners.
