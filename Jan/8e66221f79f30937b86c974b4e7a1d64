PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa and the Covid-19 National Command Council saved South Africans from many troubles by banning alcohol on 28 December. People were not beaten or injured this time around. Others managed to save money to return to work and buy school uniform. Alcohol isn’t everything, and it was good to see some heavy boozers staying sober for once. Some tried to find ways to get alcohol but failed because many liquor stores complied this time around. The priority is to save lives. I’m urging all not to see the ban as a punitive measure. Ramaphosa’s imposition of a revised level 3 lockdown saved many lives. Let’s see this as a way to save lives and other troubles.
