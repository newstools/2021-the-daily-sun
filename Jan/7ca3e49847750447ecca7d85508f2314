MPUMALANGA Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane has extended her condolences to the Mthembu family. This follows the untimely passing of Minister Jackson Mthembu who died from Covid-19 related complications early yesterday 21 January. Mtshweni-Tsipane described Mthembu as a selfless embodiment of ethical and principled leadership who led not only with words, but with actions. She said Mthembu was at the forefront of the fight to end the crime against humanity that was apartheid. “The province has lost a true son of the soil. Minister Mthembu played a central role in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and ensured that information was disseminated to South Africans through the various media briefings he chaired,” she said. “His passing leaves us with a deeper commitment to serve our people tirelessly. He is a legacy we all endeavour to replicate and honour. May his soul rest in peace,” said Mtshweni-Tsipane.
