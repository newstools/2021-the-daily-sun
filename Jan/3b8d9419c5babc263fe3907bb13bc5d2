Minister of Social Development Lindiwe Zulu is concerned over the number of people living with disabilities in the Western Cape. She said the number of people receiving disability grants in Western Cape is much higher than in any other province of Mzansi. Sassa officials said it was an issue of a high approval rate, but Zulu said she is concerned. “The Western Cape seems to have a high number of people receiving disability grants. It’s not just the approval rate, my concern is what are the causes of the disability that we end up with such numbers,” she said. Zulu said she is not suggesting that people should not have disabilities but the numbers are worrisome. “Not that I’m saying they should not be but to me, as the Department of Social Development, we cannot just look at the end game. We need to go back and look at what actually is the problem. We need to find out what is it that made the Western Cape to have people with the highest number of disabilities in the entire country. To me, it became an area of interest when I was looking at the numbers,” she said. Community leaders who were present told the minister that people abuse home made booze called umtshovalale. “It messes up with your system. It eats your internal organs and weakens your body. It is very cheap and our people buy that. A person will tell you that they don’t have money for bread but you see them buying that booze,” said ANC councillor Sharon Manata. Zulu said the matter should be discussed between the national and provincial government. “Is there some societal problem? Is there some health issue causing this somewhere? It is not something for us to discuss today. It is something for us, together with the Western Cape government, to be asking ourselves on what is the cause. There is always a cause for disability,” said Zulu.
