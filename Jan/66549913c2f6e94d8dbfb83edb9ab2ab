SQUATTER camp residents are asked to return artificial grass taken from a stadium. Mfuleni CPF chairman Mavusi Gqola told Daily Sun residents stole the grass from Mfuleni Stadium in Cape Town while building their shacks late last year. “We don’t have a problem with them building their shacks, but they must not destroy what is already in the community,” he said. Mavusi said some residents alerted the CFP of the problem and they found all the grass was stolen from the stadium. “We couldn’t believe what we saw because the soccer field is for everyone, including their kids,” he said. Mavusi said he was worried that kids would end up getting into trouble because they didn’t have anywhere to play soccer. “Let’s protect what we have in our communities. “We saw the shacks that have artificial grass and we will soon visit the police station for assistance,” he said. Mavusi said anyone who took the grass should return it or go to the police station. “People are decorating their shacks with it. When the police come, they will have to pay. If they bought the grass, they will also have to pay because we have advised residents not to buy stolen property,” he said. A resident said they didn’t have a problem with people building shacks but stealing was unacceptable. Luzuko Damane (34) said crime had gone up since the shacks were built.
