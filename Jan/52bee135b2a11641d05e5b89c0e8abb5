AT this rate, Gavin Hunt could count himself lucky he is not in charge of Chippa United. For, at the poor rate Kaizer Chiefs are going, the Amakhosi coach would already be sent packing at the Chilli Boys. It was yet another bleak weekend for Chiefs as they crashed 2-0 to Maritzburg United, losing their fourth DStv Premiership match as their worst league start in the PSL era continued. Stuck in 14th spot with seven points, Amakhosi are going nowhere slowly this season and if their fortunes don’t change, Hunt’s position might become untenable. He has admitted it is going to get tougher than it is for his team, not least with the Champions League football also in the schedule. “We’ve got a lot of games. We’re getting more and more depleted, so we’ve got to be very careful,” said Hunt. “We know we are in a battle now, and with our programme it is very, very difficult with our squad. “We’re playing every two to three days. I think the best thing for us is maybe to get away from here as well because we are a little bit better outside. But in saying that we’ve got to be better at home. “Our record hasn’t been good. We have to get our league form back.” Hunt, however, has refused to make excuses, admitting his defence could be tighter. Judas Moseamedi was back to torment Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday, banging in two goals. “Disappointed with the result. I think they had two chances and they scored. “We can’t make excuses. Everyone’s in the same boat with Covid. We’ve got to be tougher, bigger, stronger. I thought for both goals we were a little bit weak. Was it really a 2-0 nil game? “You can talk all day but you’ve got to defend better. We can’t be happy with our defending,” added Hunt “It will certainly get tougher before it gets better.” But Hunt can count himself lucky he does not report to the trigger-happy chairman down in the Windy City.
