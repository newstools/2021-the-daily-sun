Itumeleng Khune is facing arguably a new challenge in his professional career... fighting his way back into the Kaizer Chiefs starting line-up. Khune has been watching from the bench in recent matches after Daniel Akpeyi wrested the number 1 jersey from him. This had following a run of poor performances by the former PSL Player of the Season since the turn of the year, including a howler in a league match against Mamelodi Sundowns. Coach Gavin Hunt had picked Khune as his first choice goalie, but that has since changed. “I thought Daniel was excellent, fantastic, he swept up well,” said Hunt when explaining Khune’s absence. “There is a lot of competition here and people need to work hard to get back in the team.” Amakhosi have turned the corner, picking 10 points from a possible 12, following a horrendous start to the season. They are seventh in the DStv Premiership and could move further with a win against Baroka FC on Tuesday.
