BAPEDI Paramount Chief Billy Mampuru died on Wednesday, 20 January. He died in a hospital in Driekop outside Tubatse, Limpopo, after a short illness. His death comes three days after the burial of King Victor Thulare III. Mampuru III was attached to the Sekhukhune Royal Family, and was the leader of the Mamone Traditional Authority. Family spokesman Moruthane Mampuru said Mampuru III did not feel well on Tuesday morning. “We took him to his doctor who advised us to take him to hospital after he realised his blood sugar level was too high.  Moruthane said Mampuru III’s death shocked them. “His mission was to unite his nation through tradition. He was a champion of rural development and wanted his nation to thrive. We have lost a great leader,” he said. He said the royal family was yet to meet to discuss funeral arrangements. Limpopo Premier Stanley Mathabatha sent his condolences to the Mampuru family, relatives, house of traditional leaders, Contralesa and BaPedi ba Mamone Traditional Authority. “Once again, a dark cloud has enveloped the province. The institution of traditional leadership in our province is being riddled apart by death. Mampuru III wanted BaPedi ba Mamone to be united and forge ahead the development of their area in order to make sure it forms part of rural development. He was a man of peace, innovation and humility,” he said. Mampuru III was the great-grandson of King Mampuru II and ascended to the throne in 1998. Government renamed the Pretoria Central Prison after King Mampuru II on 10 April 2013 as a sign of recognition for the brave contribution he made in the struggle for freedom.
