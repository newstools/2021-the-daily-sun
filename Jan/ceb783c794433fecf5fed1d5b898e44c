THATO WANTS to sit back and smoke his zol and not bother anybody. But a midnight tokoloshe is stealing his weed while he sleeps! “I’VE NEVER HEARD OF A TOKOLOSHE WHO STEALS WEED!” SAID THATO. Thato Modise (34) from Orange Farm South of Joburg is a peaceful man. READ: MY MONEY SNAKE WANTS BLOOD! He told the People’s Paper he likes to tie up his weed at night so he can have a smoke at midnight and again in the morning. But since October the weed has been mysteriously disappearing. At first he thought he was too high to remember that he’d smoked his last joint, but then he realised he wasn’t alone in his house. “I started paying careful attention and counting the number of joints I had, and while I’m sleeping they disappear without a trace,” said Thato. In November, a sangoma confirmed that there’s a tokoloshe in his house. “He told me it was no problem, but the muthi he gave me to sprinkle around the house only worked for a week,” said Thato. He again went back to the sangoma, who referred him to somebody else. “The other sangoma told me he could help me. He gave me muthi to sprinkle around the house.” But the druggie creature came back again! ALSO READ: STEVE BIKO HOSPITAL IN ICU! Thato has already spent R2 300 on izangoma while the tokoloshe takes a break before coming back. He said weed means everything to him. “I haven’t had a girlfriend for a year, and I haven’t felt a void because zol is here for me.” Thato’s friend, Tokollo Mofokeng, said he’s against his friend smoking zol every day – but he’s seen how much this devastates him. Said Tokollo: “I’ve also tried to get help, but people recommend I should sprinkle salt, which doesn’t work. We don’t know what to do anymore.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said tokoloshes are usually not hard to get rid of. “I don’t know why it keeps coming. He can come to me and we’ll deal with it once and for all,” said Dungamanzi.
