PATRICE Motsepe has overcome the first hurdle in his bid to become the Caf president. Motsepe is among the four candidates whose bids have been declared admissible by the continent’s football governing body. However, Motsepe, together with fellow candidate Ahmed Yahya of Mauritania, will have to undergo further eligibility checks. The other two candidates, Augustin Senghor, the president of the Senegal FA, and Ivory Coast FA president Jacques Anouma, have been cleared to run for the presidency. “The Caf Governance Committee met in Cairo on 5 and 6 January 2021, convened by its President Michel Kizito Brizoua-Bi, to carry out the eligibility checks of candidates for the positions of Caf president and members of Caf executive committee. “Their candidatures were deemed admissible. However, the committee considered that further checks are necessary before a final decision. To this end, a hearing of these candidates will be organised in Cairo on 28 January 2021,” read the Caf statement on Motsepe and Yahya. Five candidatures officially stood for Caf presidency, but incumbent Ahmad Ahmad was declared ineligible to stand. --tso
