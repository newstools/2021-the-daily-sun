PARLIAMENT turned a blind eye to several warnings about state capture at state-owned mining company, Alexkor. Gavin Craythorne, a long-term contractor on a joint venture between Alexkor and the Alexander Bay community, said he tried to raise the alarm about the Guptas’ influence on the company for years but Parliament ignored him. He was testifying at the Zondo Commission yesterday. Craythorne said on 30 November 2017, George Nicolaai of the Equitable Access Campaign travelled to Cape Town to personally deliver a warning about serious problems at Alexkor to several portfolio committees. He said only ANC MP Zukiswa Rantho responded positively to emails he sent and requested further information, which he provided. He said she tried to arrange an oversight visit, but she was advised it would be dangerous for the committee as members’ safety couldn’t be guaranteed. He said the true value of the marine diamond mining assets of Alexkor was misrepresented. “Through this whole period of state capture, the biggest issue is that Parliament failed to protect us,” said Claythorne. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said the matter was concerning. He requested that Craythorne return to the commission with detailed info and dates of when Parliament was alerted and responses he received.
