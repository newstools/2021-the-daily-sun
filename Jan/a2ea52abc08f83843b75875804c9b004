Comedian Ta Fire’s dream has come true after scoring a lead role in a movie. The YouTube star, who’s known for his skits, will be starring in a short film called Kuyafiwa Es’hogweni. The film will air on Mzansi Magic on Saturday, 23 January. Ta Fire will star alongside Sello Ramolahloane, Nomsa Buthelezi and Unathi Guma. He told SunBuzz he felt as if he’d been working towards this opportunity for the past six years. “The past years of going to different auditions and being rejected all seem to be worth it right now. “It feels like God was training me for this opportunity, and this specific role. He finally made it happen and my long-time dream finally came true,” said the entertainer, whose real name is Siyabulela Deli.

This is a big deal to me as I come from a place where having big dreams is far-fetched.” Kuyafiwa Es’hogweni is about a guy who goes to heaven and hell. “Vusi is a troublesome Xhosa boy from Joburg. He’s trying to make it in the music industry and is willing to do anything to reach his dream. He’s a real hustler. “I don’t want to get deep into it, but it’s a comedy. The movie is about how Vusi goes to heaven and hell. But he’s so troublesome he’s even thrown out of hell because he’s too much.” The comedian said he hoped his fans would enjoy the movie. “People know that I deliver when it comes to comedy. My fans have been waiting for something like this from me,” said Ta Fire.
