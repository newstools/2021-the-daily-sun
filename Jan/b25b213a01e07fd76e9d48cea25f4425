MOST 14-year-olds listen to the latest amapiano hits, but Siyabonga Ditlhale has other things to do. The young inventor from De Brak near Rustenburg, North West, is fascinated by electronics, and has decided to follow the software development profession. Siyabonga took three weeks to create an alarm system he named Gadova Security Monitor. “I thought of this security monitor during level 3 lockdown when crime was very high. Tuck shop and supermarket owners need a peace of mind knowing that their businesses are secure,” he said.

Siyabonga will be doing his grade 10 at Geelhout Secondary School this year, but wishes to get financial assistance for a school better suited to his ambition.  “I need help to go to a school that will cater for my specific needs, and that has the necessary equipment to help me succeed.” His mentor, Kagiso Domingoes, is a well-known inventor in Rustenburg. They met through a family friend who knew Siyabonga’s dream of creating software.
