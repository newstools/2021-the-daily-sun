AL AHLY head coach Pitso Mosimane has responded to the
criticism levelled against him by Egypt legend Ibrahim Hassan. The former Red Devils defender criticised Mosimane and
questioned his abilities as the club's mentor. Hassan is currently the Sporting Director of Al Ittihad
while his twin brother, Hossam, serves as the club's coach. Hassan believes he is well capable of doing a better job
than Mosimane along with his brother at Al Ahly. However, Mosimane who is currently preparing his side for
the Fifa Club World Cup said legends will always have their say. In an interview with the South African Football
Journalists' Association (Safja) Mosimane said: “You know the saying… ‘Stay out
of the kitchen if you can't stand the heat’. “If you want to coach Al Ahly and Mamelodi Sundowns, you
don’t worry about former players. Even in England, it is happening, they
criticise (José) Mourinho they criticise Pep (Guardiola). Mosimane went on: “Former players have got what they have
to say and we always have to respect their contributions in football. "Some
speak well, Egypt Mido (Ahmed Hossam Hussein Abdelhamid) came out he spoke so
well, (Mohamed) Aboutrika has been saying good things. So, you cannot focus on
one or two who sees different. It’s okay its part of life. If you ask anybody ‘is Mamelodi
Sundowns doing well, this year’? ask the legends others will say yes, some no. “You must thrive under criticism and it is part of life.” Since joining Ahly in October this year Mosimane has played
17 matches. In those games he drew three and is yet to taste a defeat.
