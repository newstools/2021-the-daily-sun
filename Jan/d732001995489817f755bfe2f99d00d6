WHAT started off as a beautiful online love story turned into an ugly nightmare for Loretta Mkhize (42) from East Lynne, Tshwane. She thought she had found her Prince Charming on a dating site, but she soon found out that he was a scammer when he cheated her out of R8 000. She told Daily Sun that her man left her in 2018 and she thought she’d never find love again. But she fell for an online lover. They clicked after two months and she found him to be kind and sweet. Even though they had never met, they were planning on ding so – but then he told her about being arrested. “He then asked me to lend him bail money,” she said. Loretta didn’t hesitate to help him because she was already in love. “He sounded honest and genuine,” she said. “I am very helpful to my friends and family, which is why I gave him the money. He promised to pay it back as soon as he was out and I trusted him.” Two years later, Loretta still can’t get over what he did. “He stopped taking my calls. I still want my money and won’t give up on it!” she said. She said she went to the small claims court but he can’t be summoned because they don’t know where he is. “I hope Daily Sum can help me find him,” she said. When Daily Sun contacted the man, his phone went to voicemail. A man who used to work with him told Daily Sun that he also owed him R12 000. “I used to work with him. He called and said he was in jail and desperately needed money. So I gave it to him,” he said. “His phones are off, and I have no idea where he is. I’m still trying to find him,”
