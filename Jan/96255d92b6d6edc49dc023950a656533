THE family of late minister in the presidency, Jackson Mthembu, will remember his jokes and smile. This was shared at his funeral service at the Roman Catholic Church in Ackerville township in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga on Sunday, 24 January. Mthembu (62) died on Thursday, 21 January of Covid-19 complications. Paying tribute on behalf of his children, his daughter Thuli said: “I will miss you looking at me like I’m crazy when I dished anything that’s not pap because anything else is considered a salad. “I’ll miss you saying I got my beauty from you when people say I’m beautiful.”  In a letter, his wife Thembi said: “I was a young innocent girl when we met, got married at 23 and never thought we’d make it this far, but through God’s grace we made it. “Thank you for all the years we’ve spent together. We’ll always remember your jokes. You’ll always be a part of me. Love you always my beautiful, handsome husband.” His brother Buyisiwe described him as the unifier in his family. He said he supported his family. “We were four, now we are three. He once told me: ‘You see, brother. I want you to know what to do when I’m no longer around. There’ll be a time when you’ll be left alone and will be in charge’,” he said. Delivering the eulogy, President Cyril Ramaphosa touched on the role Mthembu played in the fight against the very virus that took his life. “As minister in the presidency, he was the public face of our government, communicating its policies and its decisions. During the pandemic, he carried our message of compassion, solidarity and unity,” he said. “When we found ourselves close to despair as a people and a nation, he offered hope. “When our nation’s spirits were down and flagging, he lifted them up. “He brought clarity, certainty and the utmost professionalism to every task he was assigned.” Mthembu was laid to rest at the Pretoria Memorial Park Cemetery near Emalahleni.
