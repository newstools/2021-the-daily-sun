WHEN
a lodge employee went to check a room rented out by a couple after no sign of
movement from them for two days, she was greeted by the bodies of a mother and
her two-year-old baby with their hands tied behind their backs. The
couple and the baby had checked into the lodge along the R518 near Masodi
Village outside Mokopane in Limpopo on Tuesday evening and the gruesome
discovery was only made yesterday (14 January). Colonel
Moatshe Ngoepe said it’s alleged a man was with a woman and the baby when they
were dropped off at the gate of the lodge by an unknown grey vehicle. "Apparently,
the three rented a room for overnight accommodation without providing their
personal information and promised the receptionist that they will check out the
next day, on Wednesday 13 January 2021. "The
following day, the receptionist was surprised to see no signs of the visitors
and thought they had left the premises. “On
Thursday, 14 January, she decided to go and open the rented room with the aim
of cleaning it and upon arrival, the receptionist was shocked to discover a
woman in her twenties and the toddler strangled with their hands tied from the
back and their bodies being in a state of decomposition. “Furthermore,
there was no presence of the male who came to the lodge with the two
deceased," said Ngoepe. Both
victims are still unknown but the police investigations are currently underway
to identify and locate their family. Ngoepe
said the Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has
activated a 72-hour plan to hunt down the suspect pictured below to assist them
with the investigation. Anyone
