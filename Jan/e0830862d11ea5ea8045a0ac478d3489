COPS are investigating the death of five-year-old Melani Keke, who was attacked by two pit bulls in Ny 50 in Gugulethu, Cape Town, on Sunday. His father Thando August (39) told Daily Sun that he received a call from his brother at noon. “I was with my friend when my brother called, asking me to rush to the scene. I had no idea what had happened but I immediately left.” He arrived to find residents crying. “My brother came to me just before I reached the group of residents to tell me what had happened. The owner of the dogs told me not to go because my son was in a bad condition,” he said. Thando was told his son was attacked by the dogs while trying to fetch his ball. “He climbed the wall but couldn’t jump to the other side. “The dogs attacked him while he was still on the wall and dragged him to their side,” he said. Melani’s uncle, Mxolisi Keke, said it saddened him to think of the pain he went through. He said the man, who was feeding the dogs when the incident happened, tried to help the child, but failed.  “After he tried beating the dogs, they took their anger out on my nephew. “While one dog was biting his throat, the other was biting the back of his neck. He died at the scene,” Mxolisi said. Melani’s mother tried to get to him, but was stopped by residents. “We all knew those dogs would also attack and kill her if she came close,” he said. A resident said the dogs didn’t belong in the area. “I’m glad law enforcement took away the evil dogs. We don’t want to see those animals anymore.” Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest docket was opened, but no arrests had been made. Belinda Abraham of the SPCA said: “The dogs were removed by law enforcement and are at the SPCA until the investigation is completed and a decision on their future is made.”
