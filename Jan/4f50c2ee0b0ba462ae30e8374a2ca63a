MARITZBURG United attacking midfielder Tebogo Tlolane says it was delightful to see the club get their first DStv Premiership win of the season when they defeated Bloemfontein Celtic in their previous fixture. Tlolane, on loan from Orlando Pirates, said the win took a lot of weight off their shoulders. The win, at Harry Gwala Stadium, saw Maritzburg move off the bottom of the table to 15th place to end a 14-game winless streak since last March. The club sacked Eric Tinkler recently after a poor run and turned to Ernst Middendorp, who saved them when they faced the same situation in 2015-16 season. Middendorp now turns his focus to his former team Kaizer Chiefs, who they visit at FNB Stadium on Saturday (5pm). “It was good to get the first win but the coach has made it clear that we are not out of the danger yet,” said Tlolane, who returned to the Siwelele game after contracting Covid-19. “We quickly forgot about the victory and obviously when it happened, you could see the joy on everyone’s face. But immediately when we got back to training, the coach made us aware that we should forget about the victory and work towards the next game against Chiefs.” Maritzburg had a good record against Amakhosi last season when Middendorp was Chiefs coach. They faced Chiefs three times, taking four points off them. They also beat Amakhosi in the Telkom Knockout semifinal. Middendorp will face his former club for the first time since he departed. However, Chiefs come to this game with morale high in their camp. They made history to progress to the Caf Champions League group stages for the first time after beating Primeiro de Agosto in the second round.
