IT took 15 minutes for JDR Stars to punch a hole in the Polokwane City defence at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Limpopo yesterday to open scoring in their GladAfrica Championship clash. The Soshanguve lads collected all the three points with a 2-1 victory against City. That was Bafana Kali’s third of the season for the Hammer Boyz after connecting well with a cross from Lefty Mokhabi to send shivers down the spine of the relegated PSL side. In fact, that could have been Kali’s second after he missed a golden opportunity after being put through one on one with keeper by Vusi Mncube. Despite holding ball possession in the first half, Stars let it slip 10 minutes into the second half when Puleng Tlolane punched in an equaliser for City to make it 1-1. But Mziwokuthula Zimu came about in the dying minutes of the game to head home Stars’ winner to leave the home side kicking their heels. The goals came fom h goals coming from Lungelo Nguse, Aluncedo Mazwi and Mbongiseni Mbandlwa, respectively – with goals coming in each half.
