ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer is a worried man. The injuries keep piling up for his side as they head into the Soweto derby. Bucs face Chiefs for the third time this season at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm) They have the upper hand heading into the clash having already beaten Amakhosi twice this season. Bucs thumped their rivals 5-0 over two legs in the MTN 8 and will be high in confidence. Zinnbauer’s charges are chasing a hat trick of wins over Chiefs. Bucs will have to do that without defender Innocent Maela, who will miss the derby after he collected his fourth yellow card of the season in their recent 1-1 draw with TS Galaxy. But perhaps more concerning for Zinnabuer is that he might need to find other options upfront with his attackers Gabadinho Mhango and Terrence Dzvukamanaja nursing niggles. The duo of strikers Zakhele Lepasa and Tshegofatso Mabasa continue to miss out through long term injuries. The German will hope that players such as Thembinkosi Lorch, Deon Hotto and Vincent Pule are up for the challenge and bring their scoring boots against Amakhosi. “We are short in the striking department but that is not an excuse,” said Zinnbauer. “We have other players who can score in Lorch, Pule and Hotto. And Sam has shown in the last game that he can also score. “We have to find a way to score goals, this is a very important game and players will be up for it. “They don’t need any motivation, they are playing for their families, friends and supporters.”
