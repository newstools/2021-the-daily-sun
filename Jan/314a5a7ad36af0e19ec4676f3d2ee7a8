FOOTBALL is full of role models that range from players to coaches and administrators. All of them contributes to the sport, and in return inspiring others. And it is no secret that former Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Percy Tau has been the latest inspiration to most young players, especially to Promise Mkhuma. The “Lion of Judah” as Tau is affectionately known in the football circles made his first Brighton & Hove Albion appearance as a substitute in their win over Newport in the FA Cup on Sunday. This was after Tau spent some time in Belgium with Brussels-based club Royal Union Saint-Gilloise before then moving to Club Brugge last season and helped them win the league title and played in the Champions League. He then linked up with Anderlecht where he scored four goals in 15 games this season before being recalled by his Premier League club. Mkhuma who is a Sundowns development player says he’s inspired by his fellow academy graduate. “Okay, firstly I would like to congratulate him for his hard work and being patient throughout the journey,” said the SA Under-23 player. “It was not an easy journey for him to be loaned out more than once. He never stopped putting in effort wherever he was loaned out to. “I am really happy to see him back at Brighton because it’s everyone’s dream to be where he is now but it all comes with hard work and staying positive. “It is inspiring to us the younger ones that no matter what the circumstances, just stay positive and put in the hard work. It’s a lesson that nothing in life comes easy and lastly, I would like to wish him well and I believe he is going to do well. Hard work pays off.” Mkhuma, who is also tipped to be the next big thing, has already won two titles with Sundowns since he was promoted to the senior team in January last year. He won the Premiership title and the Nedbank Cup with the club this season.
