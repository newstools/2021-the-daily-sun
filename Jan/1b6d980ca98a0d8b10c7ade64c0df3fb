ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has admitted that his side have recently been shy as far as goals are concerned. But is he worried? Not in the slightest. The 50-year-old German mentor is confident that his charges will find their scoring boots sooner rather than later. And he would be over the moon if that were to happen in their next DStv Premiership match against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) at Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday (5pm). Zinnbauer is aware of his side’s struggles in front of goal since the injuries to strikers Zakhele Lepasa and Tshegofatso Mabasa. But he has faith in his other strikers such as Gabadinho Mhango, Jean-Marc Makusu and Austin Muwowo. Zinnbauer reckons his side has too much firepower upfront and it is only a matter of time before his attackers find their range. He insists players such as Thembinkosi Lorch, Deon Hotto and Terrence Dzvukamanja cannot be kept quiet for too long. The return of Vincent Pule from injury will also boost the Bucs attack ahead of their clash against TTM. “I don’t think we are a team that rely on one or two players,” said Zinnbauer. “We can’t say (Zakhele) Lepasa and (Tshegofatso) Mabasa are not here so we can’t score. We have a lot of other strikers who can also score goals for us. “I think Gabadinho (Mhango) has been playing well for us in the past few games, even though he hasn’t scored, which is unlucky. “We have a good team and any one of our other strikers can score. “We will also have (Vincent) Pule back and that’s good. “We have a lot of players who can score goals at any time for us. It’s not in every game that a striker will score, sometimes midfielders and defenders can also score goals. I’m not worried. “I’m happy that we are creating these chances to score and it’s only a matter of time before we start converting them again and win games. That is what we have to do.” ) CONTINUED ON PAGE 14
