YANGA Sidimba (27) and his girlfriend, Anita Bolanti (22), were both set alight in a domestic violence incident before Christmas. Anita died, and Yanga is still in hospital. The lovebirds were living in a backyard shack in Delft outside Cape Town. The incident started when Yanga’s family heard screams on 19 December at about midnight. His brother-in-law Sadi Sibomana opened his window and saw Yanga on fire. “He was rolling in the sand, screaming for help. I saw flames in the house. “The couch was on fire and Anita was inside the shack, naked and badly burnt,” Sadi said. He said they put out the fire and took them to the clinic. “On the way, Yanga kept asking Anita, ‘what have I done? Why did you burn me?’” And, all Anita said was “xolo sthandwa sam” which means, “I’m sorry my love”. A resident told the SunTeam the two had been arguing. “About 30 minutes later, there was a fire,” she said. When Yanga’s mother Ntombizine Mapuntu opened her door, she saw him on fire trying to put out the flames. “We still don’t know what happened because the fire only burnt the corner of the fridge, couch and cupboard,” she said. “We rushed them to the clinic and they were taken to Tygerberg Hospital. Anita died two days later,” said sister Zizipho Mapuntu. Health spokesman Byron La Hoe said a patient matching the description was admitted to Tygerberg, and in a critical but stable state.
