While some might believe that money makes the world go round. Sexologists will argue that sex not only makes the world go round, it also literally brings life to earth. Now, if we are to move with that notion. The recent happenings should ring the panic alarm bells. According to global researchers, the fertility rate is dropping at an alarming rate. In other words, humans are no longer making babies and here is the forecast: According to a BBC report, by the year 2100 countries such as Spain and Japan will see their population halved at the current fertility rate. The average number of children a woman gives birth to is falling. According to researchers, if the number falls below approximately 2,1, then the size of the population starts to fall. Besides the global pandemic, experts attribute this to more women in education and work spaces, as well as greater access to contraception. This leads to women choosing to have fewer children. So, is this really such a bad thing?
