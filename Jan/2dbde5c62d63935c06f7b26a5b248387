He deserves recognition for the sterling role he played in advancing the lives of the people of KZN,” said the premier. Zikalala said Ntuli was a humble servant who left a mark. “While the pain of the loss is still hard to bear, his legacy will never be erased from our hearts and minds. “We will strive daily to end poverty and bring hope and dignity to our people.” He expressed his gratitude for the messages of support from across society and outside South Africa. “MEC Ntuli will be laid to rest at his home in Empangeni. A prayer service will take place at Esikhaleni Community Hall. Proceedings will commence from 9am,” Zikalala said. He added that the service would be streamed live on KZN provincial government platforms. “The funeral will follow level 3 adjusted regulations and Covid-19 protocols.
