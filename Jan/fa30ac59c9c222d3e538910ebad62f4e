THE family buried their young champion with heavy hearts. Bongani Korasi (7), shot and killed in Phiri in Soweto, was buried on Saturday, 23 January. His father Mandla Fakude said: “I’m at a loss for words. All I know is that these idiots robbed me of my young man. I’ll never be able to heal.” Mandla said he hoped Bongani protected the family. Bongani’s granddad Sidwel thanked the community.  “We’ve lost a great soul. He was still young and had a bright future. May he rest in peace. But we can’t let these people get away with what they did to him,” he said. Neighbour Slindile Gwabeni said Bongani left a mark on everyone’s hearts. “He was very inquisitive. He was too smart for his age,” she said. Bongani’s teacher at Isipho Primary School, Ntobeko Ndlela, said she loved his smile. She said you’d never see him angry, no matter how much you shouted at him. “He was a smart boy. May his soul rest in peace,” said Ntobeko. Community leader Themba Maseko said the community would always be there for the family.  He said: “We won’t rest until we find these perpetrators. We’ll put pressure on the police and even go to the national office if we have to.” African Christian Democratic Party national spokesman, Thabang Moshidi, said God would fight the family’s battle for them. “We need to put our faith back in God. We’re fighting so many problems. We lose kids every day.” Moshidi said government needed to intervene, but most of all it God needed to lead. “They’re chasing people for alcohol instead of chasing criminals who kill children,” he said. “Human trafficking and drugs are a problem. Africa needs to go back to God.”
