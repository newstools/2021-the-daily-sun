VUSI Mazibuko is at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, where he was admitted with Covid-19 two weeks ago. But his wife Morongwe wasn’t so lucky. She succumbed to the virus. What pains the 63-year-old from Naturena, south of Joburg, is that he couldn’t pay his last respects to his wife of 20 years and the mum of their five children. He was in ICU when she was buried on 8 January. “Not being able to bury my wife was traumatic. I was comforted by the fact that she was buried with respect and dignity,” said Vusi. He said one of the first things he’d do when he’s discharged is to visit her grave. Vusi said the last time they were together they were preparing for a game drive. But an SMS that confirmed her positive results forced them to abandon their plans. She started experiencing respiratory problems after a few hours, and he rushed her to the Netcare Mulbarton Hospital, where she was admitted, but died.  Vusi said some of the patients in desperate need of supplementary oxygen terrified him. “I was staring down the barrel of a gun. I saw people gasping heavily, but I’ve also seen people being saved,” he said. “I want to ask vaccine naysayers to take this seriously.”
