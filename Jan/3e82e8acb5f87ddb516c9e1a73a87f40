A BIG announcement will be made on Monday with regards to the sale of Tshakhuma FC which have been bought by medical doctor, Sello Ntsoko. Johnny Mogaladi of Polokwane City is also believed to be in the mix with an interest buying the club, but Ntsoko is in the front. But fact remains that the club has been SOLD, and the players will officially know this Monday. Word of mouth is that club boss, Masala Mulaudzi, has called an URGENT meeting with players and technical staff at 3.30pm where he will make an announcement that the club has been sold and explain their future. According to sources close to the whole negotiations, the club's sale has been delayed by debts that the club has endured overtime since they started campaigning in the PSL. In documents seen by SunSport two weeks ago, the club is being sold for R42 million, but the potential buyers are willing to fork out R37m immediately upon signature of the sale agreement. As reported by SunSport, the remaining R5m will be paid into lawyersâ€™ trust account "for the payment of any claim whatsoever coming from the sale of the club". "If the claims have been paid and there is still the remaining balance, this will be paid to the seller after a three-month period," read the letter further. It is understood that the club will move from Thohoyandou to Polokwane where they will play their matches at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium, and occasionally use the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg for some of their home matches. It remains unclear what will happen to current coach Joel Masutha, or any of the technical team members as the new owners might bring along their own team of coaching personnel.
