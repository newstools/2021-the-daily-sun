JOHN Maduka is a relived man! The Bloemfontein Celtic coach can finally breathe easier after his side ended a wretched run in the DStv Premiership. Phunya Sele Sele ended a six match winless run in the league when they beat struggling Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) 1-0 at the weekend. Celtic are still in the bottom half of the table having struggled to find any kind of consistency so far this season. And pressure was beginning to mount on their Malawian mentor Maduka. The result against TTM, however, has eased some pressure and Maduka will be hoping it will get their season going again. “It was a very difficult game,” admitted a relived Maduka. “We needed an early goal just to calm the nerves and we could then play our normal game. “We knew that they would come at us, they did exactly that but we managed to keep them at bay. “It really was a tough game, there is no easy team in this league. There is no team that makes it easy for anyone. “The boys have worked very hard and that’s how you win games, you need to work harder than the opponent. “It will never be easy, but you have to get the job done. We did not play the way we usually play. “They did not allow us to keep possession and play our usual game but we were more direct and got the job done. “We are happy to get the win.” Maduka will be hoping for more of the same in their next league match against in-form AmaZulu at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium tomorrow (3pm). Benni McCarthy’s Usuthu will be eying their third straight win having won their last two matches on the spin. Maduka is crossing fingers that midfielder Andile Fikizolo will be available for selection following an injury scare against TTM. “He is okay, he’s looking good,” confirmed Maduka. “We are just hoping that there is nothing serious that is happening because it was a scary moment. “But we are happy to see him well, he is happy and smiling and looking like his usual self. It’s good to see that.”
