BLACK Leopards have announced the sacking of head coach Dylan Kerr following a string of poor results in the DStv Premiership. On Saturday Kerr was in charge of his last match when Leopards suffered a heavy 3-0 defeat against Chippa United. Leopards are languishing in position 15 on the log standings with nine points after 12 matches. "Black Leopards FC and their coach Dylan Kerr have reached an agreement to part ways amicably," a club said in a brief statement. "Assistant coaches Morgan Shivambu and Lehlohonolo Seema together with goalkeeper coach Sam Banda will be responsible for the team in the meantime." This brings to an end a short two month period at the club for Kerr who returned to the club in November 2020 and has overseen nine matches in charge. Kerr previously managed Leopards during the 2018/2019 season guiding the team to a 13th placed finish before taking over at Baroka. This rounds up a horrid few months for the 53-year-old who left his previous job at Baroka in controversial circumstances after being shown the exit door after being found guilty of bringing the club into disrepute. Kerr had accused the club of interference after an impressive win over Mamelodi Sundowns.
