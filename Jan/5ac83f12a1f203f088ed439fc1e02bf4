A DARK cloud hangs over the Mahlangu royal family. Prince Mbangelwa Mahlangu (67) was shot dead at his home in Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga, on Saturday. According to police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the prince was shot and killed in his car. “His son heard gunshots at 8.15pm and went to investigate. He saw two men running out of the yard where his father had parked,” he said. When he approached the vehicle he saw his father leaning against the steering wheel, unconscious. “He called the police, and Mahlangu was certified dead at the scene. No one has been arrested.” ANC Nkangala regional spokesman, Sello Matshoga, condemned the brutal killing of Mahlangu, chairman of the Ndzundza Mabhoko royal house of tradition. “These criminals must be arrested and handed the most severe sentence. We equally express our heartfelt condolences to the family,” he said. Hlathi appealed to anyone with information to contact Lieutenant-Colonel April Aphane on 082 302 6621. Meanwhile, another royal family member Prince Zwelithini Dlamini (47) was shot and killed by an unknown man at Matsulu near Mbombela on 4 January at about 10pm. “The victim was eating with his two friends when the suspect entered the house and opened fire at Dlamini, killing him on the spot,” said Hlathi. Police appealed to anyone with information to call Captain Elvis Shabangu on 082 449 0339. Police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma condemned the killings. Efforts to reach the families were fruitless.
