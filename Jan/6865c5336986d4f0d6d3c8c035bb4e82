BAROKA FC has snapped Cape Town City’s winning run. Bakgaga held the in-form Citizens to a 1-1 draw at Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday. A Terrence Mashego own goal cancelled out teammate Surprise Ralani’s opener and saw the two sides share the spoils in Limpopo. The Citizens came into the clash against Bakgaga flying high having won their previous two matches. They were looking to make it three wins on the spin against an inconsistent Baroka team. Matsimela Thoka’s side have been hit and miss so far this season and headed into the clash hoping to return to winning ways. The Limpopo outfit only have one win in their last five matches. The draw against the high-flying Citizens, however, will be a welcome result for Thoka and his charges. It came on the back of yet another positive result against Kaizer Chiefs in their previous match, which was also a 1-1 draw. They remain just outside the top eight in ninth position with 17 points from 15 matches. The Citizens, meanwhile, would have been left feeling like they had lost the match having had victory snatched from their fingertips. The result saw the Mother City outfit remain in fifth spot on the Premiership standings with 23 points from 14 matches. They are ten points behind leaders and defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns. City bossed proceedings for the better part of the match but had to wait until the 50th minute to get their goal through Ralani. They should have made the game safe but they wasted a few opportunities. And they were made to pay late in the match as substitute Richard Mbulu forced Mashego to put one behind his own net. City next play Bloemfontein Celtic in the Nedbank Cup last 16 on Saturday at Cape Town Stadium (5 pm). Baroka face Cape Town Spurs on Monday at the same venue (5 pm).
