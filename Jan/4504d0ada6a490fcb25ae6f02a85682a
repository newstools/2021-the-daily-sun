SUPERSPORT United captain Ronwen Williams has stressed the importance of everyone pitching up for their January congested fixtures. Matsatsantsa A Pitori will play seven matches scheduled for this month. They have already made a fair start collecting four points in their first two matches where they drew 2-2 with Chippa United and thrashed TS Galaxy 3-0. On Wednesday, their quest will continue when they host Bloemfontein Celtic in a DStv Premiership match at Lucas Moripe Stadium (5pm). That will be followed by tricky clashes against AmaZulu‚ Mamelodi Sundowns‚ Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and Moroka Swallows this month. Williams said: “It will be a tough month for us, but so far we started well  and that is a wonderful feeling. “We need all our soldiers now. Thankfully some of our injured players are returning to action.” He added: “For us to play every third day is what we want to do, no complaints from our side. We just want to go out there play, enjoy and keep the momentum going. Williams kept his third cleansheet since the Premiership started in October. He says it will be vital for them to get more clean sheets this season. He stated: “The main thing is clean sheets because we pride ourselves in our defending‚ and we have conceded some sloppy goals. “It was wonderful to get a clean sheet again‚ not for myself but for the team because we work so hard defensively. With Thamsanqa Gabuza and Bradley Grobler Firing in all cylinders, the captain is impressed by their recent form. Williams said: “I am also happy for the strikers Gabuza and Bradley (Grobler) because they have been working very hard. It’s good for us to have top strikers firing, but the main thing is to keep momentum because things can change easily in football.” “The upcoming game won’t be easy because Celtic have taken a lot of points from us in the past and they are a very tricky side to play against. “But it’s our home game and we just have to believe that we can beat them.”
