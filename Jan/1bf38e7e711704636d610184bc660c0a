TWO Buffalo City Metro councillors have been suspended without pay in connection with fraud and corruption. Nicky Witbooi and Kuhle Ciliza’s suspension came into effect on Wednesday. Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesman, Makhaya Komisa, said Witbooi used the area committee’s services instead of the ward committee’s when dishing out food parcels. Komisa said area committee members bypassed houses not aligned to Witbooi. In relation to the fraud allegations, she allegedly took half of the money the municipality had allocated to a destitute family. On the other hand, Ciliza was alleged to have also used the services of the area committee instead of the ward committee, resulting in people from other areas being selected as beneficiaries. There allegedly was a list duplication, leading to some families receiving food parcels twice. Ciliza was alleged to have asked for a R50 000 tjotjo from an artist and kicking out a resident from a house, resulting in the owner’s goods becoming damaged. MEC Xolile Nqatha said he’d decided to take up the cases after failure of the council to act. He said the cases were serious and had a negative impact on government renewal and good governance. “The need to take action against wrongdoing is in the interest of building public confidence in government,” said
