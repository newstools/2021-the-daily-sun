A JMPD
officer was injured after trying to stop an after tears gathering. This comes
after officers attended an 'After Tears' complaint. JMPD spokesman, Xolani
Fihla told the People's Paper that this happened in Protea Glen Ext 7, where
approximately 150 people gathered. Fihla said
when officers arrived, some of the participants left but others refused to
leave. "Officers confiscated alcohol and the participants that were left
behind started fighting with the officers," he said. He further stated
that one officer was assaulted. "He sustained injuries on his face,"
said Fihla. He told the
People's Paper that two suspects were arrested, and one fled the scene, leaving
his car which was impounded. "The suspects arrested were charged for
assault with intention to cause grievous bodily harm and the contravention of
the Disaster Management Act Adjusted Level three regulation by being part of an
illegal gathering," said Fihla. The JMPD
condemned the assault of any police official. "We cannot allow that to
happen. The attack on police officers who are legally executing their duties is
an attack on the rule of law in the city," said Fihla.
