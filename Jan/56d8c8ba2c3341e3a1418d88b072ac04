THEY drive around in a white Toyota Quantum, but they don’t transport commuters. This is because the occupants are thugs who rob people. Now two people are fighting for their lives in hospital after they were struck in the head with a hammer by the Quantum thugs. The incident happened when the taxi stopped in front of the victims and the occupants, armed with hammers, assaulted them before robbing them. The victims, aged 19 and 27, from Tshepisong near Kagiso in Mogale City, were left to die. But residents called an ambulance and they were rushed to hospital. Cops are now hunting for the thugs. Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said cops were patrolling in Tshepisong when they received a complaint of assault on New Year’s Day. “Upon arrival, residents informed the police that two badly beaten victims were rushed to a local hospital in a serious condition. “Police proceeded to the hospital where they learnt that the victims were attacked by unknown suspects driving a white Toyota Quantum. The suspects allegedly used a hammer to attack the victims and demanded cash. The two victims sustained open wounds on their heads,” he said. Sibiya said the cops got a tip-off from residents about one suspect who was spotted in the area. The suspect was bust, and the other one remains at large. Sibiya said the suspect will appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court soon. Community members said they were now fearing for their lives and that of their children. Resident Samson Mpanza (56) told the People’s Paper: “I have warned my children to stay home, especially at night because it is not safe out there. I also told them to respect the curfew at all times.”
