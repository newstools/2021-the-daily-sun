MFULENI residents in Cape Town say sangoma Mavusi Gqola is a God-send ekasi. This is because he’s always available to help in difficult times. On Saturday, Gqola fed more than 300 people at his soup kitchen, which has been running for three years. “This is our first meal for 2021. We are doing this for the families who are struggling to put food on the table during this pandemic,” he said. Residents told Daily Sun they were happy Gqola resumed with the soup kitchen. “He normally feeds people three to four times a week, so we were worried when we didn’t see him last week. We are happy that he’s back as he helped us during the pandemic,” said gogo Noloyiso Jambase. Kids walked all the way from Burundi squatter camp to Khethimpilo Community Hall, where Gqola fed the community. Anelisa Madiba (37), who was with her three kids, said she worked at a shebeen, but had no source of income as it was closed. “I’m not expecting any money at the end of the month unless the president lifts the alcohol ban. I will come to the feeding scheme until I return to work. This man is helping many hungry people.” Gqola said Yebo Fresh, a food delivery company, donated food to him to feed the community for the month, and they would work together until after the lockdown.
