A WANTED suspect who allegedly strangled his 20-year-old partner Chantelle Ester Ash and her nine-months-old baby girl to death last week Tuesday at a Lodge in Masodi village, Mokopane, in Limpopo has been arrested. A 29-year-old suspect Mohammad Nasir was arrested in Brixton, Joburg, last night 21 January. He briefly appeared before the Mokerong Magistrate's Court today where he was denied bail. He was remanded in custody until 29 January for formal bail application and further police investigations. Limpopo police commissioner, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has welcomed the arrest of alleged murderer. “We commend our police for the speedy arrest of the suspects and believe that the swift action should send a clear message to those involved in heinous crimes especially against women and children that they will be tracked down and brought to book.” Both the mother and her baby girl were found killed with their hands tied from the back and their bodies being in a state of decomposition in one of the rooms at a lodge last week Thursday 14 January. It is alleged that on Tuesday 12 January at about 7pm, the suspect, the woman and their nine-month-old baby were dropped off at the gate of the lodge by a grey unknown motor vehicle. The three rented a room for overnight accommodation without providing their personal information and promised the receptionist that they will check out the next day on Wednesday 13 January at 9am. The following day, the receptionist decided to go and check on them and made the gruesome discovery.
