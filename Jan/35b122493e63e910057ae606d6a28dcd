THE Mhlongo family wants justice for their son, Thabiso (19). He was allegedly stabbed to death by a fellow student at Durban University of Technology’s Sterling House residence on Thursday, 7 January. Thabiso’s mum Thandeka (43) from Mandeni, northern KZN, said on the day of the incident, the second year human resource management student and three other students were discussing their studies in their room when the suspect joined them. “They all engaged in the discussion, which turned sour when the suspect referred to Thabiso as a small boy. This didn’t sit well with him. “The suspect insisted that he was, while brushing Thabiso’s head. “He pushed the suspect away. That was when the suspect drew a knife from the kitchen counter and stabbed Thabiso once in his upper body,” Thandeka said. She said after the suspect realised what he did, he allegedly washed the knife and put it back on the counter. “He then took off his T-shirt, which was drained with Thabiso’s blood, and wrapped it around his hand before leaving the residence.” Thandeka said they were deeply saddened by the killing. “My son left home to complete the schoolwork that was left unfinished last year due to Covid-19. “I plead with anyone who might see the suspect to please report him to the police because I want him behind bars,” she added. University media officer Simangele Zuma said: “Our colleagues from student services will contact the deceased student’s next of kin and provide the necessary support to the family. “DUT passes its sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased. May his soul rest in peace.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “A case of murder is being investigated by Durban Central police. “The suspect fled the scene after the incident and is being sought by police.”
