THE Meyiwas are not prepared to back down. They’re so determined they even hired top lawyer Advocate Malesela Teffo to help them crack the case. Speaking to Daily Sun, Teffo said: “I was approached by Senzo’s brother Sfiso on 5 January, asking me to liaise with various stakeholders in the matter because the family needs closure.” A lot of holes in the matter seemed to be ignored. “This high-profile case involves big names,” he said. “There are two investigating teams: one reporting to the police minister and another to the national police commissioner. “I see no reason why the culprits are not brought to book. They know them.” When he spoke to Senzo’s mother over the phone, she wanted to die in peace knowing her son’s death was not in vain. “She told me she’s never find peace unless the right people were brought to book. They know who was in the house but haven’t charged them. Their lives continue as usual.” Senzo’s brother had even questioned why the Vosloorus house, a crime scene, was sold. “A lot of things are questionable in this matter and Sfiso is confident the people who were recently arrested in his brother’s case are not the suspects. “He told me he knows his brother’s killer, and people that should be questioned were the ones in the Vosloorus house on that fateful night,” he said. Teffo said he’d meet with the family next month to discuss a way forward. He said he’d liaise with the investigating teams, prosecutors and the media on behalf of the family. Teffo said he’d work very closely with the family and give them feedback on any progress.
