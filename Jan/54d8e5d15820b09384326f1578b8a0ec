RESIDENTS of Limpopo are advised to be vigilant and stay safe in their homes as heavy rainfall is expected to hit the Mopani District very hard this Sunday. That’s after the South African Weather Service warned tropical storm Eloise is expected to move over the border of Zimbabwe and Limpopo, including some parts of Mpumalanga in the early hours of Sunday. Mopani District spokesman Odas Ngobeni said they were made aware there’s also a severe risk for disruptive rain affecting Ba-Phalaborwa, Greater Giyani and Maruleng municipalities. “We, therefore, urge residents to be vigilant and stay indoors if possible and avoid crossing rivers, flooded roads and low-lying bridges. “But we also wish to advise motorists to drive with caution. Our Disaster Management Centre is on high alert, and we again advise our people to report emergencies to the Centralised Communication Centre on 015 306 7000, 015 307 5555 or 060 551 1911.”
