A CHURCH leader’s life is filled with misery. People started spreading rumours that he used a snake to bring more people to his church. Matshaya Tutu (39) from Philippi Browns Farm, Cape Town, said this affected his children. “People shout at them when they walk in the street, saying their father has a snake.” The Zion Church leader, who’s also a sangoma, said he didn’t know who started the rumour but suspected jealous church leaders. “My church has a lot of members. This doesn’t sit well with some people, so they came up with a plan to destroy me,” said Tutu. “I lost a few members, but many remained with me because they believe in the God that leads me.” He said some people realised the matter was just a smear campaign meant to tarnish his name. “Some people asked for forgiveness after it became clear that I don’t have a snake,” said Tutu. “I didn’t have anything to hide. I forgave them. When you work with people accusations come up.” Zizipho Mkungela (51) from Murray squatter camp said she’d heard the rumour. “I know Tutu to be a man of God and was shocked to hear these accusations, but I couldn’t say anything,” she said. “I thought those who were spreading them had evidence, but the matter died down because nobody proved it.”
