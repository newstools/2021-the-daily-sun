THREE taxis and
a vehicle belonging to a taxi boss have been burnt in Polokwane, Limpopo. This comes
after a clash between three rival taxi associations over a route to Mall of the
North. The taxi
violence started on Thursday evening (14 January) after a car belonging to a
taxi boss from the Moletji Taxi Association was set alight. A 22-seater
minibus taxi was also set alight on the same night along Matlala Road, while
two Toyota Quantums were torched on Friday (15 January) while ferrying
commuters to work on Dendron Road. Gunshots were
also fired during the brawl but no one was injured. Itâ€™s not the
first time the Seshego Polokwane Taxi Association, Mankweng Taxi Association
and Moletji Taxi Association have fight over the route to Mall of the North.
Their last clash happened in September last year. Brigadier
Motlafela Mojapelo said cases of malicious damage to property, attempted
murder, assault and robbery have been opened at the Polokwane, Seshego and
Westenburg police stations.
