ACCORDING to the South African Weather Service, various parts of the Kruger National Park, particularly the far north, will be affected by rainfall and winds on Sunday, 24 January, due to tropical storm Eloise. Park managing executive, Gareth Coleman, said: “Emergency teams are on standby monitoring the situation, and will be activated if there’s any danger. “Our scientists, in conjunction with the weather service, are closely monitoring developments and will advise on whether we need to evacuate camps or not. “As a precautionary measure, we’ve already closed all gravel roads and some facilities in Pafuri after heavy rains in the evening of 20 January.” He said SANParks had advised that people with bookings in the far north be accommodated at Letaba, Mopani, Shingwedzi and Punda Maria Rest camps. Bushbuckridge municipal spokesman, Aubrey Mnisi, said: “All residents, particularly parents, are urged to ensure that children are indoors early as heavy rainfall with floods and possible uprooting of trees are expected.” Mpumalanga co-operative governance and traditional affairs spokesman, George Mthethwa, said: “Provincial disaster management activated its role players in anticipation of possible responses, should the cyclone affect any of the municipalities.” The cyclone will affect Bushbuckridge, Mbombela, Kruger National Park, Thaba Chweu, Nkomazi and Dr Pixley ka Isaka Seme, Thembisile Hani, Dr JS Moroka and Victor Khanye municipalities.
