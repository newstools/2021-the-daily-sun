FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns winger, Anthony Laffor, has spoken about his move to Chippa United. The veteran player was announced by The Chilli Boys on Friday after signing a short term deal with the club. Talking about his move to the Port Elizabeth based club, Laffor revealed that there were other offers on the table. He said: “First of all, I would like to say a very big thank you to the coach and the president himself Chippa for giving me this opportunity. “It was not difficult (joining the club), because after I spoke to the coach and the president I knew that Chippa is where I’m supposed to be, because I had other clubs that I was talking to but I chose Chippa United because I knew that Chippa is the best place for me to be.” The 35-year-old Liberia international is one of the most decorated players in the PSL and has seven league winners' medals to his name. He's also won the Caf Champions League and has two Nedbank Cups, two Telkom Knockouts and one MTN8  title to his credit. Laffor began his time in South Africa with Jomo Cosmos before moving on to SuperSport United and then joining Sundowns in 2012. He’s played a combined 299 matches in the PSL and the Champions League, scoring 63 goals and adding 33 assists.
