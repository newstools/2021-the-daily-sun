IT has been two years since her boyfriend was killed, but Mmankepi Rammutla says it still feels like yesterday. This after her lover Benjamin Setshogoee (61) was allegedly killed at their home on 30 December 2019. But Mmankepi (51) from Wallmansthal in Tshwane has still not found closure. She said she was not home when Benjamin was shot. “I was at my kid’s house, but I spoke to him before he went to bed. “He said he saw someone wearing a white T-shirt in the yard, and that my boyfriend was found dead the next morning.” She said they were supposed to get married in March. “My life changed completely after he died. His kids came to get all his things. They even took his house.” Mmankepi said she felt the police were not doing anything to find her lover’s killers. “His death was very weird, because he was sleeping alone in the house.” She said she wouldn’t rest until his killers were in jail. “Something must be done, because I know that someone killed him and they are freely walking in the street.” Mmankepi said she couldn’t sleep at night. “My life is not the same, but I know it will be better if the person or people who killed my man are arrested.”
