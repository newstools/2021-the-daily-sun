A private security company, Blue Security, was called to Albert Park in Durban shortly before midnight on January 2 and were confronted by the grisly sight of multiple foetuses that had been dumped there. “The officer had been on routine patrol in the area when he was flagged down by vagrants in the Park who alerted him to their discovery of between seven and ten unborn foetuses dumped in some nearby trash,” said Blue Security community and media liaison officer, Andreas Mathios. After following up, and confirming that there were indeed a number of frozen foetuses dumped in the rubbish, the officer immediately contacted the SAPS 10111 call centre. “Members of SAPS and a government mortuary van arrived a short while later and cordoned off the area whilst continuing with their investigation into piecing together the crime scene,” Mathios said. Detectives were also at the Park and the possibility of an illegal abortion clinic has not been ruled out. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information can notify 10111, he said.
