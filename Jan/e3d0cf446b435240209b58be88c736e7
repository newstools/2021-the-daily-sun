The Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) has launched an investigation into a video of its officers seemingly assaulting a man.  In the 43-second video, which was shared on social media, four TMPD officers are seen throwing a man over a low brick fence, at what appears to be a residential home, and then slapping him before loading him into their vehicle. Once in the vehicle, the man can be heard screaming. In a statement on Thursday, TMPD confirmed that the vehicle and the officers seen in the video were from their department. "The Tshwane Metro Police Department is conducting internal investigations regarding the video. However, no complaint has been formally lodged in relation to the video. We request the person who seems to be assaulted on the video to come forward, for obtaining more information that will assist with the investigation," said TMPD spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba. Mahamba also called on members of the public, who may have information about the video, to contact TMPD anonymously on 083 657 2998. News24
