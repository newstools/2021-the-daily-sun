MINISTER of Higher Education Blade Nzimande has inducted new board members to Nsfas. The new board is made up of Ernest Khosa, who’s chairman, department representative Pretty Makukule, Maxwell Fuzani, Prof Pumela Msweli, Cyril Madiba, Yonke Twani, Jullie Beya, Sanele Zondi, Richard Msweli, Lindiwe Matlali, Bamanye Matiwane and Reshma Mathura. Nzimande announced the appointment of a new board on 26 November after it was put under administration under Randall Carolissen in 2018. Nzimande said the department would be making a presentation to the new board on key policy issues on Thursday, 7 January. “It’s critical that the board understands the interdependencies of Nsfas with the department and all connected institutions. “The board also has a responsibility to ensure that ethical practices are ingrained in the governance system, both of the board itself and management, through the policies it adopts and fiduciary oversight it exercises. “The board must at all times act as a collective, regardless of the views that individual members of the board might have on certain issues,” said Nzimande. He said he appointed in 2019 a ministerial committee of inquiry chaired by Prof Yunus Ballim to investigate the cause of the problems at Nsfas. The committee was expected to report back in the first quarter of this year.
