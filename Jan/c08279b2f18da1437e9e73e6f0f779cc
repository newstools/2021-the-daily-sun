WITH booze, videos and naked bodies in a jacuzzi at a secret venue, it was quite a party. But did they know their exclusive party would go viral? Probably not. . . The video of a group of women in their 30s and two men, apparently taken somewhere in Vanderbijlpark in the south of Joburg, surfaced on social media recently. READ: TWINS WANT ONE HUBBY! In the 21-second video, the women are drinking what appears to be alcohol. The women seen on the video have since deactivated their accounts as their profiles were circulating on social media platforms with the video. On Facebook, Sibusiso Khuzwayo said: “This is a shame. I’m sure this was intended to end up on their phones. “Look now. It’s all over social media.” Themba Ndebele said: “Why do they allow videos to be taken when they’re having fun in hidden places? “Now this has damaged their lives, their reputations and their social lives.” Busi Mhlongo said: “I hope this is a lesson to everyone to stay away from taking videos which always end up on social media. “The person who’s taking the video isn’t seen, yet these women are exposed.” ALSO READ: TWO COPS KILLED IN TRUCK ACCIDENT! Mbali Hlophe said: “We shouldn’t blame the women. “We don’t know if they’ve been drugged. I don’t think they’re normal.” Sizwe Mokoena said: “You may find our sisters were drugged. Let’s not judge without understanding the circumstances. “We should be protecting them and not sharing such content.” The People’s Paper tried to trace the women, but none of them have answered calls and their social media profiles have since been closed.
