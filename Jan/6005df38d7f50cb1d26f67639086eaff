HE used to dribble flat-footed opponents in the development side of AmaZulu FC for a living. But Andile Nzimande now wants to score in the film industry with a new Zulu drama. The change came about after the soccer star was without a club since 2018. He decided to focus on his other talent: scriptwriting. The 25-year-old from Pietermaritzburg in KZN said he started writing Zulu drama, Induku Enhle, in July last year, and it’s expected to be on Mzansi Wethu in August. “The drama is about a prince who can’t find a suitable wife in his village. So he looks for a wife in another village. I have writing talent but put my energy into playing football.” The former reserve side player apparently suffered a knee injury after his two-year contract ended with Chippa United. “I miss football and scoring goals, but life must continue,” he said. Football helped him keep fit and strong. “I miss teamwork, competition and especially scoring goals,” he said. “I still have at least 10 years of football left in me.” The football star said he’s pursuing the film career while looking for a team. “I love football. I’m disappointed and heartbroken that I’m not playing,” he said. “People have been asking me when they’ll see me playing football again, and it’s disappointing to tell them I’m still looking for a team.” He said he’s still young and hungry. And his message to fans? “I’m training hard to stay fit. I’m positive something good will come up,” said Andile.
