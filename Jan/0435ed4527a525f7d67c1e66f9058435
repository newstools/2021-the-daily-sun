She worked for a bank in the quality assurance department. “In 2018, I started a YouTube channel, Gogo Moyo TV, whose main focus is to start conversations around spiritual liberation in our households,” she said. Gogo Moyo said she’s always been passionate about teaching the youth. “Through my work, I’ve been recognised across the globe as an ambassador for change in traditional healing.” She said from the beginning of her spiritual journey she’d been speaking on behalf of her colleagues through the media. “I trained students who qualified as traditional healers and prophets. I continue training more as teaching is a passion of mine.” After she was honoured, Gogo Moyo started trending on Twitter as messages of congratulations poured in.
