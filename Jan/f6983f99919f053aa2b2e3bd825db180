Premier League Brighton and Hove Albion were pushed all the way to a sudden death penalty shootout before overcoming fourth-tier Newport County in the FA Cup third round on Sunday after the game ended 1-1 following extra-time. South African star Percy Tau made his debut when he came on as a second-half substitute. Brighton keeper Jason Steele produced four superb saves during the shootout which the South Coast side won 4-3 on penalties. Brighton looked to have sealed victory in normal time when Solly March fired home a fine shot from the edge of the box in the 90th minute.But Newport, who enjoyed a run to the fifth round in 2019, equalised in the sixth minute of stoppage time when Steele completely missed a cross and the ball flew in off the legs of Brighton defender Adam Webster. But after a goalless extra-time, both Steele and Webster redeemed themselves with Steel's brilliant saves and then Webster converting the decisive spot kick to send Graham Potter's team into the fourth round draw. ????
