IT may not be your typical gospel songs, but Gabola Church followers enjoy them! This is according to their leader, Pope TD Makiti when describing the 29-track, two-CD The Gospel According to Gabola Church. “We’re excited about the project. We’re already receiving many likes on social media platforms, which shows that the CDs are going to do well,” said Pope Makiti. He said among their followers are lovers of Black Label and Castle beer, pineapple, umqombothi, and Savanna cider. He said the CDs were released earlier this month, but because of lockdown their followers had not been able to access them. In one song the Bishop shouts the words hallelujah Amstel saying alcohol is their communion while a choir sings the chorus. “We’ll be forced to produce the CDs if people want more, even though our challenge is to get enough funds to make them.” He said they only have a few copies. He said their fans were not happy with lockdown regulations. “We’re one church and we’re there for the people. Unlike some other churches, we’re not here for the money,” he said. “We’re there for families who don’t have pastors who’ll bury their loved ones for free.”
