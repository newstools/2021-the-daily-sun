 SCHOOL kids don't know how to social distance. They stood in a group close to each other with their masks
on their chins and this irked their parents. They say the principal of Montessori School in Springs,
Ekurhuleni insists on having their kids back at school amid the deadly second
wave of Covid-19. Speaking to Daily sun parents said the principal is doing
this even though the Department of Education has postponed the reopening of
schools by two weeks. "This second wave is no joke, people are falling like
flies. What more with schools that insist on our kids attending." "We scared because children don't care about social
distancing." Montessori School is one of the independent schools that
were operating today. Daily Sun visited the school only to find kids in a group
with others not having their masks on correctly and others not having them on at all. But other parents interviewed said they are caught up in the
middle because they also want their children to learn. "We have already paid the school fees and bought the
stationery." Deputy principal, Betty Smith said they were told that
independent schools could continue operating. "We'll communicate with parents tomorrow on the way
forward." However, MEC Panyaza Lesufi has promised to deal hard on
schools that are defying his orders and action will be taken against such
schools. He added their behavior was reckless given the high rate of
infections in the country. The number of Covid-19 infections in SA is standing at 1 337
926 with a total of 12 267 new cases identified since the last report. The deaths are over 37 000.
