VENDA king Toni Mphephu Ramabulana has urged his people to follow Covid-19 regulations and take the necessary precautions. The king was deeply concerned with the spike in cases, and urged people to stay home. His message came after the Covid-19 wave hit the Vhembe District three weeks ago. The king said he had been informed by the health department that community meetings, funerals and church gatherings had been identified as a major cause of infection. “I am appealing to communities to refrain from attending such gatherings, and to leave behind the customs of eating after funerals and hugging each other,” he pleaded. “People are advised to stay home and only go out when necessary. This helps prevent infections.” The king urged them to follow all the rules laid out by President Cyril Ramaphosa during his address on Monday. “I also make the clarion call to traditional leader, as the custodians of the people, to help with informing them of what they can do to save their lives,” said the king. “We wish everyone the best for 2021 and hope we can restore the nation to health. “We hope the new year will bring relief, and that lives and livelihoods can be rebuilt.” The king advised people to pray to God so His grace would help them overcome the monster of the virus.
