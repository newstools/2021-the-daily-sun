WHETHER in Parliament or in her indumba, Nonceba Soga (59) from Mfuleni wears make-up and makes sure her nails are on point. “Who said a sangoma must look scruffy?” she said. “Maybe those from the olden days didn’t look that neat. “But maybe it was because of circumstances. They were practising in the rural areas. “The current crop of sangomas are educated and work in offices. I’m one of those sangomas.” Nonceba has been working in Parliament for 20 years as a personal assistant in the portfolio committee on transport.

Nonceba accepted the calling when she was about 19, but she told her ancestors she wouldn’t want to change herself. “I wanted to stay true to myself: my make-up, pedicure and manicure. “I wanted to look good. I said if this would change me I’d be pretending to be someone I’m not.” Nonceba was a church girl growing up, and it wasn’t easy for her to answer the ancestral calling. “My parents were church people and my father was a pastor. The sangoma idea didn’t make sense to them,” she said. She’d already moved out of her parents’ house when she became a thwasa. When the SunTeam arrived at her home in Mfuleni, there were amathwasa whom she’s guiding to be sangomas. “Juggling office work and being a sangoma means I’m busy every day,” she said. “I go to work during the week, but I have to make sure I do my sangoma work on weekends.”
