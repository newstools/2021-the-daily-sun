Dancers in the Champions Dance Crew say 2020 has been a great year filled with blessings for them. The pantsula and gqom dancers, who’ve travelled the world, will be starring in their first Netflix dance series, Jiva. The founder of the group, Eric “Tinkler” Delwa, said they were grateful for the opportunity. He told SunBuzz: “We attended an audition for the series months back and we were chosen. We were one of the two groups that were chosen in KZN and we’re proud of ourselves. “We enjoyed it a lot and we had a five-star experience. “An experience we only get overseas. We were impressed.” ALSO READ: SFISO SAYS CARD SCAMMING IS NO JOKE! He said although the past months had been bad for people in the entertainment industry, they never struggled. “During lockdown, we thought things would be bad, but they weren’t,” Eric said. “We didn’t have gigs, but people who love our work overseas asked us to make live stream shows, so they can watch and donate money. “That’s how we survived this tough year. People came through for us. “We thank our fans for their support.” Eric has also stepped into the music world and is about to release a single, titled Amanzi Amancane. “It’ll be released on 5 January and people will see the music video on all TV channels. I decided to release music because we were approached by some producers who suggested we get into music,” he said. The nine-member dance group from Ntuzuma in KZN has travelled to Denmark, New York, Scotland and the UK over the past three years.
