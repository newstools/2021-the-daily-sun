THE ANCYL Crisis Committee in Gauteng wants the arrest of the entire Tshwane ANCYL Regional Executive Committee for peddling fake news on Covid-19 through posters which incorrectly alleged that alkaline foods and steaming cure the virus. The crisis committee opened cases at the Brooklyn Police Station in Tshwane on Thursday, 14 January. Committee member Vutomi Nkuna said President Cyril Ramaphosa is occupied with saving lives, and it’s a collective responsibility to combat any efforts that undermine the work of government. The ANCYL in Tshwane had earlier this week released pamphlets encouraging residents to steam and eat fruit and vegetables. The campaign received backlash on social media and now is pitting comrade against comrade. To make matters worse, the league in Tshwane had used a picture of late former minister of health Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang. Tshabalala-Msimang, dubbed Dr Beetroot during the HIV/Aids pandemic, was not without controversy. She earned global ridicule for encouraging sufferers of HIV to eat beetroot. ALSO READ: DRIVER BUST
WITH CIDERS IN BOOT! Although the league’s Tshwane spokesman Nicholas Munyai said their campaign didn’t mean people should disregard Covid-19 regulations and said the pamphlet with Tshabalala-Msimang was not supposed to be released to the public, the provincial committee was having none of it. They wanted the league in Tshwane to be punished. Nkuna said the Youth League in Tshwane had embarrassed them. “This is no time to spread fake news. They should face the consequences of their actions so that they can learn a lesson. I hope the law will take its course,” Nkuna said. But Munyai insisted the pamphlet with Tshabalala-Msimang were not supposed to be released. “Our call for people to steam doesn’t mean people should stop adhering to regulations. They must continue to wear masks, practice social distancing and stay at home,” he said.
