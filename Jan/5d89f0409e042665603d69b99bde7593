THE Independent Police Investigative Directorate Ipid) has said it is investigating the cops who sjambokked two men last week. Spokeswoman Ndileka Cola said an investigation was started shortly after a video of the incident went viral. It’s believed the incident occurred on Monday, 18 January in Worcester, Western Cape. The cops have been identified as members of the anti-gang unit. “Ipid has managed to identify the anti-gang unit members captured in the video but the other individuals, the men being searched, slapped and sjambokked, are yet to be identified and interviewed as part of the investigation process,” she said. The investigation was started just two days after the incident. A video of the cops sjambokking and slapping two men went viral on social media and caused an outcry. After the video surfaced, Western Cape police spokeswoman Brigadier Novela Potelwa condemned the police officers’ behaviour. This was not the first time the anti-gang unit was accused of police brutality. In September last year, Cape Town kickboxer Renier van der Vyfer accused the unit of beating him and his friends. Last year, Ipid investigated the case of Lero Oliphant from Elsies River, who died after allegedly being assaulted by members of the unit while in custody.
