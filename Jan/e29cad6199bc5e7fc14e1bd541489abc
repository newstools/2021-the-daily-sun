AMAPIANO man Jacob “Wakhe” Sello Motsepe has died. The 48-year-old, who launched a four-song EP called Mpho Nthite in November, died on Sunday in Mmakau, North West. He released the EP with David “Poponki” Moeketsi (60). It was named after Rama City chairman Mpho Nthite, who helped them get RDP houses in September last year. Wakhe’s brother Thomas said he died from HIV-related illnesses, and described him as a good man full of jokes. “I don’t believe my brother is no more. I was next to him when he died at home. Though he was weak, he was still full of jokes,” he said. “He was a brother and friend. It’s painful to lose him as he was looking forward to taking his music to another level.” His aunt Maria Motsepe said Wakhe still had big plans. “We will welcome his body with his songs on Friday, and play them again during his funeral on Saturday,” she said. His producer Eric Chauke of Injabulo Records said he discovered the duo in 2018. “He was a good man who loved music.” Former radio and TV presenter Tim Modise said these were sad news. “I recently met him at the launch of their music video. I wish to convey my condolences to the family.” Singer Chomee, whose real name is Thulisile Madihlaba, said Wakhe was talented.
