HLOMPHO Kekana is not particularly happy about being benched at Mamelodi Sundowns. Downs co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi hinted at Kekana’s discontent while explaining the lack of game-time for the captain. Kekana, 35, has been a regular feature in the Brazilians’ line-up for the past five seasons. But this season, under the new coaching regime, the veteran midfielder has found game-time hard to come by. He came on as a second-half substitute in their Caf Champions League game against Jwaneng FC at Loftus on Tuesday. “It was also nice to see the captain coming back after a long layoff,” said Mngqithi.“I believe he came in and showed some freshness. The reason why we are not playing him is that we want him to be fresh. “He might not like the fact he is not playing regularly, but we believe he is very important for us if he is fresher... than to continue killing him and his pace and his excitement of playing the game.“He looked good in the few minutes that we gave him. We are looking forward to seeing what going to happen in the near future.“
