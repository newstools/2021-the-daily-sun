PASTORS differ about the closing of churches since level 3 came into effect again. Reverend Sibusiso Feni from Zion Angels of God said banning the sale of booze was a good thing, but closing churches wasn’t. He said the country’s president made a mistake. “We’re supposed to pray to fight the virus, but how can we do that if he closes churches?” said Feni. He said government could have allowed two hours for church services. “Every time he closes drinking places he closes churches. Why? How is this related to Christian behaviour?” said Feni. Pastor Nokwanda Mkongi-Makwela from Palm Tree House Ministries said government didn’t ban people from praying and worshipping. “But rules require that church people don’t gather physically to protect citizens,” she said. “As leaders, we have to consider the safety of our people and ourselves. “I believe it’s not for us to test God to prove a point.” Mkongi-Makwela said the Bible tells us to respect those who’re in authority. “We have to abide by the rules and regulations of the country. A dead congregant can’t go to church. “It’s the right thing to do to comply, so the reputation of the church isn’t dented.” She said they had other means of fellowship such as social media. “God can’t be confined to a building. He’s everywhere,” she said.
