IN football, you don’t always get what you deserve. That’s the belief of Bloemfontein Celtic coach John Maduka. The 50-year-old was adamant that his side did not deserve to end up on the losing side in their clash against SuperSport United on Wednesday. He insist that their 2-1 defeat at Lucas Moripe Stadium was not a true reflection of the match. “I think we played well, it was just unfortunate that we conceded the goals on set-pieces,” said Maduka. “We could have done better in those instances. But I believe a loss was not a true reflection of the game. “We controlled so many moments but we were not sharp enough in the final third to score the goals. “But we knew that our opponents were strong on set-pieces and that’s what they did. “It’s frustrating to lose a game like this, we played one of our best games but we walk away empty-handed.” Nevertheless, Maduka is hoping his side will get what they deserve against Stellenbosch FC in their next match. The encounter takes place at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Saturday (3.30 pm).
