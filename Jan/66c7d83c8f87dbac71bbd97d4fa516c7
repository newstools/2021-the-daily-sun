CEMETERIES in Tshwane are beginning to resemble game farms and nature reserves instead of a final resting place for the dead. At Zandfontein cemetery, graves are hidden behind the long grass that cover even the tallest tombstones. At the Rebecca Street and Atteridgeville cemeteries, driveways are covered in bushes and even small trees are starting to grow and are turning the cemeteries into jungles. Unhappy residents said they paid rates and taxes and expect the cemeteries to be kept clean. Mapadi Kgomo (50) of Lotus Gardens, Tshwane, said she had to turn away when she tried to visit her mother’s grave in Atteridgeville. “A rabbit jumped out of the bushes and scared me. If there are rabbits it means there are also snakes and who knows what other dangerous animals,” she said. She said thugs could also take advantage of mourners or those who come to perform rituals. Terrence Koko (56) of Jukulyn in Soshanguve said residents should stop paying rates. “What is the municipality doing with the money?” he asked. City of Tshwane spokesman, Lindela Mashigo said they will investigate why the cemeteries got into that state and will correct it.
