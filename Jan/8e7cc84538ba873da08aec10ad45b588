THE Kgadi family had hoped to have a happy Christmas and a good start to the new year. But this was not to be: vutha destroyed their Christmas preparations on 24 December. The fire destroyed furniture, blankets and the children’s Christmas clothes. Mahlogonolo (26) from Nellmapius extension 2, Tshwane, lost R3 000 in cash! “It was the worst Christmas ever as I had to beg for clothes and food. “I’m struggling to sleep. I have nightmares. The vutha left me with the clothes I was wearing.” She’s now appealing for help.  Her mastandi, Motshidisi Mokhwane, (30) told Daily Sun evil people sent vutha to destroy the shacks, her only source of income. “My tenant didn’t deserve to suffer like this,” she said. “Everything she owned burnt down, including all her documents. “Firefighters did come, but the fire was too big.” Motshidisi said she’d often heard about vutha, but never thought it would leave her heartbroken. She said she couldn’t help Mahlogonolo and her kid financially as she’s not working. She said she’s looking for a powerful sangoma to help protect her home. Sangoma Simon Mudau (57) said vutha is normally sent by jealous people. “In this matter, an evil person wanted the family to suffer,” he said. “They must find a powerful sangoma to chase away the evil spirits.” Tshwane emergency services spokesman, Charles Mabaso, told the People’s Paper: “The cause of the fire is being investigated. No injuries were reported.”
