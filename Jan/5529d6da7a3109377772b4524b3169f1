"On Thursday and Friday, he visited 23 centres in the Free State. Monitoring will proceed to the Northern Cape, North West, Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and complete with KwaZulu Natal provinces on 18 January 2021," he  said. Mweli said for the first time in the 125 history of the administration of the examinations, the Basic Education Sector has placed health and safety as priority number 1. He said COVID-19 has added an extra dimension to marking as they have known it, now the emphasis is really on safety before they focus on the quality of marking. "We cannot afford to have marking centres as super spreaders of the coronavirus and that is the message, we are taking to colleagues in all the marking centres,” he said. Mweli said that the wearing of masks, social distancing and sanitizing must never be compromised under any circumstances during marking but also in general. He said that he was satisfied that the logistics were in place in all centres and that marking in earnest is underway. “The marking of each question paper is based on an organizational structure which is strictly hierarchical to ensure control and quality assurance of marking," he said.
