The well-rounded media personality recently took to social media to share a video of himself in a meeting discussing the plans for the restaurant. “Next level, from TV show to cookbook, jets, yachts and restaurants,” he captioned the video, showing the set-up of his eatery. “Your dreams should not scare you, nothing is stopping me now. I’m a child of God, the son of my ancestors. If it doesn’t kill you, it should make you richer.” ALSO READ | DJ SBU RTIRES FROM RADIO In a previous interview with Daily Sun, the reality TV star, who launched his cookbook Dinner at Somizi’s; I Am Not A Chef, said he would open the doors of his restaurant in June this year. “Come hell or high water, next year in June I’m opening a restaurant.
