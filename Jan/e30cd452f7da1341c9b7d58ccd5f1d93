THE way Peter Shalulile and Mothobi Mvala are adjusting to life at Mamelodi Sundowns does not come as a surprise to the players’ former boss Brad Kaftel. Kaftel, a former director of Highlands Park, sold both players to Sundowns before he relinquished the DStv Premiership club’s status by selling it to TS Galaxy boss Tim Sukazi during the off season. Kaftel said they had proven their quality when they were at the Tembisa club and such a move across Gauteng to Chloorkop was the next step they needed to take in their careers to greater heights. “They are doing well in the best team in the country and one of the best on the continent. “They were well-established players in the PSL. (We knew) they could play at the highest level,” said Kaftel. Shalulile hit the ground running. He scored on his league debut for Sundowns against Kaizer Chiefs in the first game of the season. The Namibian international, who claimed the PSL Golden Boot award last season as the joint top scorer, keeps showing hunger for goals. He has formed a telepathic understanding with fellow new signing Kermit Erasmus and Themba Zwane to help the Brazilians go top of the table and unbeaten, so far. “Peter scored so many goals for us and was the top scorer last season and the stand out player,” said Kaftel. “The players that they are playing against haven’t changed. There is no reason why they can’t be successful.” Mvala, who plays a deeper role and sometimes as No 9, started slowly. But he has grown, netting his first goal on his first start for Sundowns against Golden Arrows in the last game of 2020. He followed that up with another goal in the Caf Champions League first round, first leg against Jwaneng Galaxy where Shalulile also scored in Botswana. Coming to the second leg in Pretoria, Mvala scored again as Sundowns won 3-1 (5-1 on aggregate) to progress to the group stages.
