SENIOR staff members at Tembisa Hospital are enemies of the truth. This is according to Patricia Lethole, whose son Shonisani died at the Ekurhuleni hospital after not getting food for 100 hours following admission. She was speaking in a virtual media briefing yesterday after a finding by the health ombudsman that Shonisani was starved to death. “We were shocked to read in the report that senior medical professionals and leaders of the hospital misrepresented information,” said Patricia. “I was so surprised at how a hospital could be an enemy of the truth like this. It’s shocking. “We’re deeply disappointed that senior staff entrusted with providing care for the sick and vulnerable during a pandemic couldn’t find the ethical courage to tell the truth and speak out. “How can you deal with human beings if you can’t tell the truth?” Patricia told the media her son’s case wasn’t isolated. “The report finally shone the light on what has been going on at Tembisa Hospital,” she said. Although it’s been seven months since Shonisani died, Patricia said it was still fresh and felt like it happened seven days ago. In a TV interview, CEO Dr Lekopane Mogaladi said: “We’re actually taking this matter to appeal. We’re at the level of exhausting all internal processes.” Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said the department won’t challenge the findings. The department was committed to implementing recommendations. “Those who’ve expressed intentions to challenge it will do so in their individual capacities.”
