WHILE fireworks lit up the sky on New Year’s Eve, the body of Mantoa James was rotting in a shallow grave. The remains of the 43-year-old were found buried behind a shack in Sharpeville, the Vaal, on Monday, 4 January. She was murdered allegedly by her boyfriend on Christmas Day and her body was left on the couch in the home the couple shared. The boyfriend allegedly slept two nights with the body in the house before wrapping it in a blanket and burying it. After the gruesome discovery was made, residents packed the street to get a look. Many were clearly in shock as they watched forensic pathologists dig up the body. Mantoa’s cousin Mummy Radebe said they last saw her after dropping her off after a Christmas lunch. “Mantoa was sending voice notes on WhatsApp saying she had a good time,” she said. Mummy said she called Mantoa’s sister on Monday to ask when she last saw her. “She said she last saw her on Christmas and when she sent her a WhatsApp message the following day, she didn’t respond. She said her boyfriend told her she went to Villiers,” she said. When Mummy tried to call the boyfriend, he put the phone down. “That’s when I told my younger sister to go to the house where they lived to check what was going on,” she said. A relative of Mantoa’s, Moithati Thaane (27) went to check the house with her gogo. She said they took the boyfriend to the cop shop when he couldn’t give them straight answers and later he allegedly confessed to killing her. The murder has confirmed the Gauteng community safety department’s fears that the Vaal is becoming the province’s gender-based violence capital. This comes after a series of incidents including one where a woman was stabbed several times and set alight in a shack in Evaton. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed a suspect was arrested and would appear in Vereeniging Magistrates Court on Thursday.
