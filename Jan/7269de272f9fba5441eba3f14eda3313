An 
intelligence-driven operation has led to the arrest of a man linked to 
an armed robbery and a cash-in-transit heist in George.  The 
51-year-old suspect was wanted for a robbery and cash-in-transit heist 
that took place at the George local organic fresh fruit market on 21 
December 2020. A team comprising the Hawks, Crime Intelligence, 
Public Order Policing, Eden Cluster Crime Combating team and Local 
Criminal Record Centre acted on information about a suspect at a house 
allegedly in possession of a large amount of cash.   "The suspects reportedly waited for 
the arrival of the cash van while holding the staff hostage. Upon 
arrival the crew was threatened with firearms and disarmed. "The 
driver of the cash van attempted to drive away after he noticed what was
 happening, but his vehicle was blocked by a white single cab Toyota 
Hilux bakkie," added Ramovha. The cash van driver was also disarmed and ordered to open the back of the van. "The
 suspects then helped themselves to the cash. An investigation is 
ongoing and the other suspects are still at large," he added.
