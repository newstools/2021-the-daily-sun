KING Victor Thulare III of the Bapedi Nation was laid to rest at his home village of Mohlaletse in Sekhukhune, Limpopo, on Sunday, 17 January. The 40-year-old king died of Covid-19 on 6 January at a hospital in Pretoria North, Gauteng. As accorded by President Cyril Ramaphosa, he was buried in a special category 1 funeral, where all national flags were lowered from 13 January until his funeral. His death comes about a year after he was officially recognised by Ramaphosa after a Constitutional Court judgment that legally confirmed him as the rightful heir to the Bapedi throne after 45 years of legal dispute. King Thulare III was described as a man who had a constructive approach to his engagements – a fearless and principled figure. He was committed to championing the economic development of his people. On behalf of the royal family, Sekwati Thulare said: “We have lost a great leader who always wanted the best for his people.” Representing Bapedi chiefs, chief Nkwane Malekane said King Thulare was buried on the day he was scheduled to appoint a council that would deal with the Sekhukhune economy. “ His work and vision must continue. We will continue supporting the royal family.” Delivering his eulogy, President Ramaphosa said the king’s death had engulfed the kingdom in a dark cloud. “We are weeping. Any rendition of his life would not be complete without the appreciation of the good things he has done. “We have lost a shining example of traditional leadership. He wanted to grow the local economy.” The president said his dreams must not die with him.
