SUPERSPORT United striker Bradley Grobler has described the feat of breaking the late Abram Raselemane’s record as ‘an honour.’ The reserved yet lethal in front of goal striker became United’s all-time top goalscorer with 58 goals on Wednesday. His goal along with that of strike partner Thamsanqa Gabuza handed SuperSport a 2-1 win over Bloemfontein Celtic at Lucas Moripe Stadium. The result saw Matsatsantsa A Pitori overtake Swallows FC into second place with 22 points from ten matches. “It’s an unbelievable feeling,” said Grobler. “I think when people mentioned the 57 goals it seemed so far away at the time, I think I was six goals away but when I equaled it last week I thought it would be the toughest task to surpass it and go one more. “But fortunately enough, this happened sooner than I expected. And as I say in many interviews, the club has done a lot for me. They have stuck with me through thick and thin, through all my injuries and this is just my way of thanking them and repaying the faith they have shown in me. “This is a great club and a very prestigious club so I’m honoured to have achieved this at this club.”
