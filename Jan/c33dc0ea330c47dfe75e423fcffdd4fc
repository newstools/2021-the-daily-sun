 AMAZULU are set to appoint Vasili Manuasakis as Benni McCarthy’s assistant coach in the next coming days. Manuasakis has resigned at Cape Town City in the same role and is reuniting with McCarthy, who was his assistant before the former Bafana Bafana striker resigned in November 2019. McCarthy is trying to work with people he knows and recently told Allan Freese that he’s not part of his coaching entourage and the former Platinum Stars coach has since left to join Free State Stars. Manuasakis will now the second McCarthy’s assistant coach after the former FC Porto striker brought in PSL all-time goal scorer Siyabonga Nomvethe recently. Bhele was on the bench in McCarthy’s first game in charge when Usuthu beat Chippa United 3-1 at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on 23 December last year. McCarthy and Manuasakis helped City win the MTN8 trophy in 2018 when the Mother City club beat SuperSport United in the Wafa Wafa final in Durban, in what was McCarthy’s first trophy as a head coach. At the same time, City have moved swiftly to replace Manuasakis. They are set to appoint former Bafana captain Aaron Mokoena as Jan Olde Riekerink’s assistant coach. Just like McCarthy, Mokoena played in Holland for Ajax Amsterdam, Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth both in the English Premier League. This will be Mokoena’s first stint in coaching terms since he was released by now-defunct Bidvest Wits at the end of 2012-13 season in what was the end of his playing career. Mbazo, as he’s known, is the most capped Bafana player in history with 107 caps with a return of two goals.
