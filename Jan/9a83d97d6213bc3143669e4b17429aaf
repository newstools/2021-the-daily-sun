“I SAW my cousin being killed.” These were the devastating words of Nelly Ngobese (34) from Ntuzuma, north of Durban. Her cousin, bus driver Zazi Cele (50) from uMzinyathi, was killed on Wednesday evening. Cele was dropping off passengers at KwaMashu Train Station on Malandela Road when a passenger pulled out a gun and shot him several times. Nelly told Daily Sun she was in the bus behind Zazi’s car. “When the suspect fired shots other passengers screamed, telling us to hide. After the incident the suspect jumped out and ran away,” said Nelly. She ran towards a nearby shop. “I came back and saw my cousin had died. I then called the family.” Traumatised Nelly said she last saw her cousin last year at his mother’s funeral. “He was very excited when he saw me and asked how long I’d been taking the bus because he’d never seen me. I still can’t believe what happened.” She said Zazi was a pastor at Glory of Ministry Church. “I really don’t know why he was killed. He was a friendly man,” she said. Metro police superintendent, Parboo Sewpersad, confirmed the incident. “I can confirm that the bus driver was shot four times. Police are investigating,” said Sewpersad. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the man opened fire, fatally wounding the driver on the neck, shoulder and ribs. “The suspect fled the scene on foot and nothing was taken from the driver and passengers.” A murder case was opened at KwaMashu cop shop, and the motive for the killing was unknown.
