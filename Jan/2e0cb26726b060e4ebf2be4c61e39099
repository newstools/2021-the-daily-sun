THE Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality loses about R300 million a year on izinyoka, whose evil work overloads the power grid and leads to constant outages and loss of lives. MMC for electricity and energy Luxolo Namette on Wednesday led electricity and energy officials in an operation aimed at clamping down on izinyoka in Korsten, Port Elizabeth. “The illegal connections don’t only cost the city millions every year in lost revenue, but they also result in loss of lives,” said Namette. “All the shops which have connected electricity illegally have already been cut off and the operation is ongoing. The city will crack down on all illegal connections.” He wanted to send a strong message to those who tamper with infrastructure. “We’re coming for you. The city will continue to find solutions to ensure that all households receive the required electricity and energy supply including shacks, but people must not connect illegally.” He said people must apply for electricity as izinyoka connections may kill. A shop owner said he didn’t know his shop had been connected illegally. “I pay rent every month. The landlord is the one who needs to explain himself,” he said.
