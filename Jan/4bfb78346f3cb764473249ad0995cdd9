SOUTH Africa teenage football star Sinoxolo Cesane needs funds to fulfil her dream of playing overseas. The 21-year-old got a four-year full scholarship at the East Tennessee State University (University of ETSU) in the United States. Cesane is set to study the NCAA Division I (D-I), which is the highest level of intercollegiate athletics sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States. The player, who has represented South Africa women’s team at Under-17 and U-20 level needs R30 000, which she believes will be enough for her to reach her destination. Sinoxolo, who is a twin sister of Noxolo Cesane, should have jetted off to the US on Friday but due to the lack of funding, she has been given a grace period. Talking to SunSport, she pleaded with Mzansi to help her achieve her dream of playing overseas, where she will also be continuing with her studies. She also revealed how she got the scholarship. “We got an email from the East Tennessee State University coach approaching us with a full scholarship there, so we accepted the offer,” she added. “I was supposed to leave first, then my sister Noxolo will follow later in the year. It is a four-year scholarship. I was supposed to be leaving soon but because I haven’t managed to raise enough funds for my flight, I am struggling financially I can’t leave. “I need to get a flight ticket then I will be good to go. “I have even created a page for funds where people can donate, that would be highly appreciated. I urge all those that can assist, help me to fulfil the dream.”
