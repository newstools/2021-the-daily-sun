THE two Mozambicans nationals who were bust for illegally operating a refinery laboratory will remain in police custody until Tuesday 26 January. The suspects, aged 17 and 35, appeared in the Sundra Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 20 January for a formal bail application. They were arrested last Friday, 15 January for illegally operating a gold refinery lab at Sundra Property Farm. Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi said a joint team responded to the information received aby Sundra cops about a truck that was driving along the neighbouring farms without headlights on. They were bust by a team comprising the directorate’s serious organised crime investigators, the police, the local record criminal centre, the forensic science laboratory and the Evander gold mine. “When police arrived at the identified address, the suspects fled the scene and the police gave chase, resulting in the arrest of the two suspects. A search was later conducted at the premises, which led to the discovery of two illegal refinery laboratories operating on the farm where a group of illegal miners were employed to illegally process the gold. “Three phendukas were found in each refinery. The phendukas were electrically operated and gold bearing materials were also found and confiscated for further investigation,” said Sekgotodi.
