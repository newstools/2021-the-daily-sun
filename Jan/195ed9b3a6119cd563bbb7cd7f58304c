FORMER president Jacob Zuma has been ordered to appear before the Zondo Commission. The Constitutional Court ruled on Thursday, 28 January that no one was above the law. The Zondo Commission applied to the court for direct access to compel Zuma to appear before it after he walked out without giving evidence last year. Justice Chris Jafta said: “The former president is ordered to obey all summonses and directives lawfully issued by the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.” He said Zuma did not have a right to remain silent in proceedings before the commission, but could raise privilege rights not to incriminate himself. The Constitutional Court ordered the former president to pay costs for the commission and the court. Jafta said Zuma has to give his side of the story because he was firmly placed at the centre of investigations, which include that he surrendered constitutional powers to unelected individuals. He said the allegations were serious and could pose danger to Mzansi’s fledgling democracy. “It is ironic that the directives were issued in terms of regulations made by the former president himself under the authority of the Commissions Act. The commission itself was established by him in terms of the Constitution. It is, therefore, unacceptable that he is the one who frustrates its investigation,” said Jafta. He said Zuma’s conduct (refusal to comply with summons) was a direct breach of the rule of law. “In our system, no one is above the law. Even those who have the privilege of making laws are bound to respect and comply with those laws. For as long as they are in operation, those laws must be obeyed,” said Jafta.
