FORMER Prasa CEO Lucky Montana has once again accused the
Zondo Commission of bias and hellbent on ignoring his evidence. In a statement this evening, Montana said the commission cancelled
his hearing scheduled to begin tomorrow because of small mistakes in the way he
filed his supporting documents. "The commission stated as its primary reason for its
decision that my annexures are either not marked or numbered or incomplete. I
have since written to the secretary of the commission, Itumeleng Mosala,
challenging the decision of the commission and the reasons for the cancelation," he
said. He said the commission has not told him if he would be able
to give evidence before it completes its work. Montana said the decision was aimed at blocking these
annexures from being admitted as evidence because they were damning on the
commission itself, its preferred witnesses and the narrative that he was part
of people who stole or mismanaged public funds as part of the state capture. "For the record, I have submitted 31 bundles of
documents which are numbered, each described in detail in the Index and linked
to the annexure number in my affidavit. The commission claims this is not in
line with its own “practice”, which it has not shared with me," he said. He said the commission analysed the annexures for a full
week, noted the damning contents, and had to find a reason not to admit his evidence. Montana said Zondo did not give him the opportunity to
correct the mistakes instead, it chose to cancel the entire testimony. "This is a case of the Commission elevating a technical
point over the more important issue of unearthing evidence that could help the
Commission to find the truth," said Montana.
