A DAM situated close to Tebogo ElizaKgomo’s house is a source of conern for her. The 44-year-old resident of Makapanstad, North West, said when the dam is full the water flows into her yard. She wants the local municipality to secure the dam. Tebogo, who walks with crutches after a serious car accident in 2004, told Daily Sun she couldn’t walk out of her yard because of the rising dam water. “The water is a health hazard. It affects me a lot, considering my health,” she said. Her other concern is that kids might drown in the dam. GENERATIONS: THE LEGACY STAR HOSPITALISED “This reminds me of a tragedy that happened in 1979, when my brother drowned in another local dam. “I’m scared of the water. I want this dam to be closed as soon as possible.” According to Tebogo, there was no dam before contractors dug up soil while fixing a road in the area. “I don’t care about cattle, donkeys and goats because there’s a nearby river,” she said. Daily Sun made an inquiry to Moretele Municipality, which had not responded at the time of going to print. Spokesman Mothupi Malebye promised to respond but never did.
