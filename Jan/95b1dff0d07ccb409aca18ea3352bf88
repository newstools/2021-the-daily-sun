SCORES of residents of Tshakhuma Village, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, were left stranded after tropical cyclone Eloise hit their village in the early hours of Sunday morning. Heavy rainfall accompanied by strong winds left many homeless. Trees were uprooted while bridges and streets were overflowing. Houses and vehicles were also submerged under water. This comes after the South African Weather Service issued a warning there’d be disruptive rainfall in the Vhembe District and across the province. It had said the cyclone was expected to move over the border of Zimbabwe and Limpopo in the early hours of Sunday.  Some villagers said even though they were ready for heavy rainfall, they were not expecting the floods to be severe. While villagers were urged to be vigilant and stay indoors, Ndwakhulu Makwarela (41) said the rain forced them to move out of their home. “We thought we’d be safe indoors, but that was not the case. The roof started leaking and water came through the door. That is when we decided to take some of our important things and move to a safe place,” she said. Residents were urged to avoid crossing rivers, flooded roads and low-lying bridges, and motorists to drive with caution. A 37-year-old was shocked to find his car submerged and floating under water. “I couldn’t believe it and there was nothing I could do. If it continues raining like this, our lives will be in more great danger. Some have already lost everything because of heavy rainfall,” he said.  Most areas received 80mm to 100mm of rain, and it’s expected to rain until Wednesday. Makhado municipal spokesman, Louis Bobodi, said about 27 households were affected. “Some people have already moved in with relatives while others insisted they were still monitoring the situation. “We agreed with them to let us know through their councillors as and when they would feel the need for alternative temporary accommodation. When they’re ready we’ll house them at local churches and schools.”
