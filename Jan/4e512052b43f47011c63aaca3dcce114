The South African Football Association (Safa) chair of the Referees Committee Natasha Tsichlas has admitted that there have been a few bad calls by match officials in recent DStv Premiership matches. However, she says the few errors does not amount to a general low standards of refereeing. Last week, in a match between Kaizer Chiefs and AmaZulu, Thembela Sikhakhane of Usuthu got away with only a yellow card after a career threatening tackle on Happy Mashiane. Again this week, two incidents from different matches set tongues wagging as the referees were caught napping. In a 0-0 draw between Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday‚ Motebang Sera was denied a legitimate goal after the assistant referee Andile Mncwango wrongly flagged him offside. On Wednesday, Orlando Pirates Fortune Makaringe was denied a goal when assistant referee Shaun Olive raised his flag and judged him offside. ‘’Yes, we might have had a few bad calls here and there by some officials but that does not amount to a blanket low standard of refereeing,” Tsichlas said at the review committee on Thursday. ‘’We review all matches and results are provided, in most cases, the following day and where an official is guilty, we sanction that individual without fear or favour.’’ The Chair of the Referees Committee said in coming weeks, all sanctions and review results will be made public without delay. “With the blessing of SAFA President, Dr Danny Jordaan, we will publish all the outcomes on SAFA platforms,’’ Tsichlas added. “The Review Committee is made up of knowledgeable individuals and one of them is renowned referee, Chris Harrison whose career was cut short by an injury. He is also a respected attorney. “These are difficult times, our officials are trying their best but that doesn’t mean we can condone poor officiating,” she concluded.
