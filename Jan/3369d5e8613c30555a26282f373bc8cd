OREN Nyalungu has been waiting for justice for almost 15 years. This after his two buses were torched by intruders at his home in New Forest outside Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga, on 4 February 2006. The incident happened after a meeting with police and a rival taxi association. The 67-year-old said Mhala cop shop boss and branch commander had invited him to a meeting with local taxi association bosses to discuss a dispute over routes. But the station bosses, who have since died, and association bosses denied any involvement in the incident. “I have been waiting for 15 years for justice to take its course. I want the intruders who torched my two buses to be brought to book. “I expected the police or justice department to call me with good news,” Oren said. He said that a few months before the incident, one of his buses was robbed at gunpoint. “The bus was travelling between Rolle and Allandale when an armed criminal robbed the driver and his assistant of an undisclosed amount of cash before fleeing on foot. I heard nothing from the police,” he shared. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “A case of malicious damage to property was opened and transferred to Mpumalanga organised crime unit. But it was closed in January 2011.” Anyone with information can contact Mhala police on 013 7730 331 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
