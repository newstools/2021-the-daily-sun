Acting Gauteng Education MEC Jacob Mamabolo has sent the department’s condolences to the family of a 59-year-old matric exam marker who died this morning (14 January). According to the MEC, the Xhosa exam paper marker was found unconscious at her accommodation by the centre manager at the Jeppe High School for Boys’ marking venue on Tuesday and was sent to hospital. He said this came after noticing the marker had not reported for duty as expected. “The marker, who tested positive for Covid-19, was admitted to hospital but unfortunately died on Thursday,” said the MEC. Mamabolo said the department has offered psycho-social support to all affected by the matter. He said some officials have been sent to accompany the family to the hospital to provide the necessary support and assistance that may be required. “Accordingly, the group of markers who were in contact with the now deceased marker were tested on Tuesday and released from the marking venue while waiting for results. “The marking centre was immediately defogged and sanitised,” he said. Mamabolo thanked all the markers for continuing to do a sterling job under these challenging times. “We call on everyone to continue observing the Covid-19 protocols aimed at reducing the spread of this deadly virus by regularly washing hands, sanitising and maintaining social distancing,” he said.
