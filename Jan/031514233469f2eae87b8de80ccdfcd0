THE health department has said it’s no longer compulsory for the bodies and coffins of people who died of Covid-19 to be wrapped in plastic. Cultural expert Mtimande Ngwenya said it’s about time the department listened to their cries. The decision to force families to wrap bodies in plastic wasn’t well received. Many complained it made it impossible to perform certain rituals. Some families reportedly resorted to exhuming bodies illegally to perform them. Ngwenya said: “Wrapping bodies and coffins in plastic is an insult to us cultural people.” He said the department’s decision to reverse the order was a step in the right direction. He warned that the spirits of those buried wrapped in plastic wouldn’t be free. This would result in spirits lingering around because rituals connecting the body to the spirit were not performed. The department said: “New directions don’t prescribe the covering of coffins with plastic, use of biohazard stickers, full PPE by funeral directors, as well as the sanitising of graves or clothes of people at the funeral as this was unnecessary. “This is unless prescribed by the relevant municipality where the grave is in an area with a high water table. “Such additional measures are applicable to all burials (not only Covid-19). “The measures prescribed are evidence-based and may change as and when new evidence is presented.”
