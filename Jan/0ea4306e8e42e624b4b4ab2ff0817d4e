CHIPPA United’s forgotten man, Kurt Lentjies, is delighted to be back in the team and reunited with coach Dan “Dance” Malesela. Lentjies had faded into obscurity and was not part of previous coach Lehlohonolo Seema’s plans. He did not even make a single appearance under Seema this season. But since the arrival of Malesela, Lentjies is slowly making his way back into the side. He has made two appearances from the bench against SuperSport United and Swallows FC. Lentjies repaid the faith Malesela has shown in him by scoring a stunner against the Dube Birds to earn a point for the Chilli Boys. “It’s not the first time working with coach Dan,” said Lentjies. “On a personal point of view, we know each other very well. He is the reason I joined the club back in 2017 and I have been recalled back into the team. “I wouldn’t say I’m rejuvenated. I would just say I’m taking it one match at a time because I have started off the bench in a few games. “That means the match fitness is not there yet, we have to be honest in this game. We have to look at ourselves and say this is what I can contribute to the team and that’s the honest relationship I have with coach Dan.” Lentjies will be hoping to get involved once more when Chippa travel to Limpopo for a date with Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm).
