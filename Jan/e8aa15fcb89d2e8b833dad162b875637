DSTV Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi has warned his charges not to rest on their laurels. The high-flying Downs started this season in fine form and are currently leading the log with 24 points from 10 league games. In their 10 matches, the 10 time PSL champions are still to lose a game after winning seven and drawing three. But despite this form, Mngqithi said his lads should continue working hard if they are to defend their title as PSL rookies Moroka Swallows are breathing down their necks. The Brazilians have a busy schedule this season as they are also playing in the Caf Champions League. “Our plans are going well so far,” said Downs co-coach Mngqithi, who is working alongside Steve Komphela and Rhulani Mokwena. “Our goal was to collect 12 points in our first five games and another 12 in the second five matches. So far we have collected 24 points in 10 games, which is exactly what we want to achieve. “Thanks to all coaches, players and everyone at the club. “We need to stay focused and continue to work hard as there is still a long way to go. We cannot afford to relax.” Downs goals were scored by the in-form midfielder and Bafana Bafana, star Themba Zwane and Lyle Lakay. The PSL Player of the Season, Zwane has scored eight goals this season. Baroka coach Matsimela Thoka said he cannot blame his team for this defeat as they tried their best, despite missing some of their key players for this crucial clash. “It is disappointing to lose, but I think the boys tired against a quality side like Sundowns,” said Thoka. “I am not trying to make excuses, but to be without all our strikers was a huge setback for us. It was not an easy win for Downs as we gave them a tough game.”
