GONE are the days when mothers would help families and neighbours when they had a funeral. Although many mothers feel they need to carry on with these customs, they are being told not to by their children due to Covid-19. However, many have taken to attending funerals behind their kids’ backs. This has led to a new trend on social media where people post images of their mums and ask people to alert them if they see them at funerals. Lindelwa Sibiya (41) said her mum Sibongile (75) had been attending funerals every weekend. She said it didn’t matter if the dead were relatives or not, her mum always showed up. “I’ve tried to speak to her, but she won’t listen. She told us that nothing will harm her in God’s presence and that it’s African culture to help mourning families,” said Lindelwa. Thembi Dladla (32) said when she spoke to her mum Qinisile (65), she was told she would also need support when a loved one died.  Siyanda Ndlela said she even asked her uncles to talk to her mum, but she only stayed away from funerals for two weeks. Lungisani Mhlongo (23) said his mum recently came home looking sad and when he asked what was wrong, she said she was turned away from a funeral as there were already 50 people. “I laughed at her as she doesn’t listen. She was grumpy all day. I just hope she always gets the chop,” said Lungisani. Mum Elina Mbatha (76) said people needed to support each other.

Rose Mthimunye (78) said she would go to fewer funerals, but she couldn’t promise to completely stop attending.
