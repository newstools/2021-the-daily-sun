WHEN her lover walked out years ago, Thoko didn’t know she was pregnant. But now her daughter is 41 years old and Thoko Ntombela (60) from Zola, Soweto needs to find her daughter’s father. She told Daily Sun her daughter, Duduzile Ntombela has become aggressive and threatened to keep terrorising her until she finds her dad. She said Duduzile is now also being disrespectful towards her in-laws. “She comes to my house and screams at me, telling me I’m a terrible mum and she’ll hate me forever for not including her father in her life.” Thoko said she fell in love with Duduzile’s father, Capson Disemela when he was selling coal and delivered it to her house.  She said she didn’t try to stop him from leaving. “He told me he was tired of Gauteng and he was homesick and I didn’t want to stop him. I didn’t know I was pregnant,” said Thoko. She said her daughter started being disrespectful and talking back to her a year ago. Then she started insulting Thoko, yelling at her in the street and telling people what a terrible mother she was. “She knows about the situation of how I met and broke up with her father. She used to understand,” said Thoko. She said now her daughter has dreams about gogos who are surrounding her. “We don’t know anything about rituals, but I suspect those are her relatives trying to send her a message.” “Her anger towards me is getting worse by day and I don’t know how to calm her down anymore,” said. “I’m scared that my daughter will do more than just insult me.” When Daily Sun asked Dudzile on the phone why she was treating her mum like that, she insisted she only wanted her father and hung up.
