YOUSSEF en-Nesyri became the first African toscore a LaLiga hat-trick this season, giving sixth-place Sevilla a 3-2 win over Real Sociedad as they seek only a second league title and first since 1946. The treble from the 23-year-old Moroccan lifted his season league tally to eight – three behind Golden Boot frontrunner Lionel Messi of Barcelona. African Footballer of the Year winners – Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane of Liverpool and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal – all scored in the FA Cup. Here is a round up of the performances of African stars in the FA Cup and major European leagues: ENGLAND SADIO MANE, MOHAMED SALAH (Liverpool): Mane and Salah got back to scoring form in a 4-1 win over a youthful Aston Villa side decimated by a Covid-19 outbreak at the club. Jurgen Klopp rested many of his other stars, but Mane and Salah started and combined for three of the English champions’ four goals at Villa Park. Mane’s header opened the scoring before a three-goal burst at the start of the second half turned the FA Cup third round tie decisively in Liverpool’s favour. Another looping header from Mane took his tally for the season to nine before Salah’s calm finish rounded off the scoring. PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG (Arsenal) Aubameyang scored his second goal from open play in 11 games as the holders needed extra time to beat Newcastle 2-0. The Gunners’ captain has struggled for form since signing a lucrative new three-year deal in September, but couldn’t miss when presented with an open goal from Kieran Tierney’s low cross late on to double Arsenal’s lead. – AFP
