TOO many people are dying and we are regularly inundated
with death notices all too often during the peak of the Coronavirus infections. But families in many townships and villages are struggling to convince their
elderly relatives to stay away from funerals. When addressing the nation recently regarding the extended
level 3 lockdown rules, President Cyril Ramaphosa warned us about funerals
being super spreaders and cut the number of mourners to 50. The reality is that
the ground is quite different as many funerals are still attended by more than
the limited 50 people. Our dear mamas and abo baba still insist on either
attending funerals or visiting the family of the deceased during the week to
console them. Even though many families have now resorted to strict
measures to discourage their elderly 
from attending funerals, our mothers, fathers, grandfathers and
grandmothers have become a huge problem. With a will of their own, they often
defy their families and dice with death by going to funerals. Someone should
tell our parents that Covid-19 does not care about our rituals and customs or
the way we are used to doing things when it comes to burying loved ones. In their advanced ages, these elderly folks are at risk of
severe illness and death if they get infected. We have seen with our escalation
statistics how the elderly have been severely affected. Our ageing parents
should know that to be treated like adults, they need to act like ones and stop
putting their families and communities’ lives at risk. – Editor.
