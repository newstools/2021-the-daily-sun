MANY people in Mzansi will go into the New Year with high hopes, expectations and dreams. Others will go into it remembering how they buried mothers, sisters and aunts who died as a result of gender-based violence. The sad reality is that every three hours a woman is killed in Mzansi â€“ and many by their partners. The hard lockdown in April and May, as a result of the outbreak of Covid-19, saw cases of GBV skyrocket. Police Minister Bheki Cele said most of these crimes happened behind closed doors. Her partner, with whom she had two kids, handed himself over to police. He was charged with murder. Her body was dumped in the bushes in Emdeni Extension, Soweto. Two suspects were arrested and charged with rape and murder.
