Residents of Mkhuhlu, near
Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, had been terrorised by a snake for several months. The python which had been
eating their livestock was caught on Tuesday, 19 January, after killing a
pregnant dog. The eight-metre long snake
was found in a resident’s yard in Mkhuhlu. Residents said they were
happy as they could now breath a sigh of relief. Godfrey Masinya, who
found the snake, told Daily Sun he was angry his dog was killed. He said his dog would always
wait for him outside the door every morning. He was surprised when he only
saw one dog and the pregnant one missing. “I tried to call the other
dog by name, but it was nowhere to be found until the remaining dog led me to
the side where the python was, but it had already eaten my pregnant dog, which
made me angry. ”When he found the snake it
was unable to move. “I believe it arrived during
the night to attack my dog because on Monday I was cutting the grass at the
spot where we found it. “I nearly killed it because
I was looking forward to my dog giving birth. I acted as a Good Samaritan
towards the python, but it still caused me pain. ”Godfrey then called the
Bushbuckridge rescue team to come fetch it. “For the past few months
chickens and cats have been disappearing in the area. We didn’t know they were
being attacked by a python. “We’re glad that finally we
caught it before it killed children. This might be a wake-up call to us to be
on the lookout for this type of snake,” said Godfrey. Fire and rescue
worker, Cockroach Mdhluli, said they were alerted by community members to a
python in a resident’s yard after it killed a dog. “On arrival at the scene we
found the eight-metre-long python. When we tried to rescue it, it vomited the
dog out and we removed it and took it to the Kruger National Park. “We want to warn residents
that if they find a snake in their yard, they shouldn’t attempt to kill it but
contact trained snake catchers,” said Mdhluli.
