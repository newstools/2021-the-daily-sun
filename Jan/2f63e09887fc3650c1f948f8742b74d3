Premier League club Brighton and Hove Albion have cut short South African star Percy Tau's loan spell with Belgian outfit Anderlecht. The Seagulls, as Brighton are affectionately known, confirmed Tau's return after successfully securing a work permit for the former Mamelodi Sundowns star. Tau had joined Anderlecht, who are managed by former Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany, last August and found the back of the net on four occasions in 15 games this season. Brighton coach Graham Potter is delighted to have Tau as part of his squad for the remainder of the Premier League season and is looking forward to what the forward has to offer. “We're pleased to be able to welcome Percy to the club and begin working with him," said Potter. "I know he's a player whose progress many of our fans have followed in recent seasons. “We too have closely monitored his performances in Belgium in the last three years. He's been playing at a really good level, particularly with Bruges and Anderlecht where he has been involved in the Champions League, and his next step is to show he is ready to make the transition into the Premier League.“He brings some different attributes and qualities to the group and he wants to take the next step in his career. We’re looking forward to working with him.”
