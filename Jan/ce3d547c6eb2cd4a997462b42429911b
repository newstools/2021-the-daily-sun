Despite the protest, the match went ahead and ended in a goalless draw at Giant Stadium. “We lodged the protest before the game and anything (other information) you have to check with the PSL,” said Bay chairman Sifiso Biyela.

Becker said the matter has been submitted to him but he’s yet to look at it. “I’ve seen their match report coming in,” said Becker. “When a club lodges a protest, they have to do so in the (first) working day after the game to lodge (the protest) in terms of the rules,” he said. “They will give us in detail the reasons for their protest. They will have to tell us exactly why they played the game under protest in terms of the PSL rules.
