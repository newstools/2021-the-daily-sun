According to sexologists, pornography has contributed greatly to our perception of sex. Many of us think that great sex involves chains and pains because of what is portrayed in porn movies. Great sex should never be painful! But according to global medical stats, many women suffer sexual pain, chronic pelvic pain unrelated to sex or pain during sex. According to an American survey, 20% of women suffer and experience sexual pain. Furthermore, another study found that nearly one in 10 women experience painful sex, known as dyspareunia. Men shouldnâ€™t also experience pain during sex unless something is wrong. Men who experience pain during sex have either not applied the right amount of lubrication, are having delayed ejaculation, have STIs or are experiencing an allergic reaction. Sex should be a pleasurable act. If you do experience pain during or after having sex, then you should seek medical advice urgently.
