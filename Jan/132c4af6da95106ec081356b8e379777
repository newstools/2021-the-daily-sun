MPUMALANGA police commissioner Lieutenant General Mondli
Zuma has again warned the public to take extra precautions and be careful with
their money. He told Daily Sun scammers have been targeting people
on social media with fake posts, urging them to deposit a sum of money into
deals which were later found to be fake. He said many people had lost a
considerable amount of money. "Perpetrators often post appealing advertisements
regarding the sale of cars, household appliances, cellphones, pets, generators,
containers and other valuable items on social media platforms, including
Facebook. “These suspects would then convince their targets who are in
a dire need of the mentioned items that they can be obtained at an unbelievable
price and urged them to deposit cash either via EFT or deposit at the bank
before the needed items are delivered. “After such a fraudulent transaction, the suspect would
confirm having received the money and at times even demand more cash. They then
vanish into thin air without fulfilling the promise." Zuma said despite countless warnings in the past, these
types of trends continue to happen. “Recently at Bethal, a complainant was defrauded a total of
R150 000 after being made to believe that a white Toyota bakkie posted and
advertised on a particular social media platform was authentic. “The victim got hooked and was told by the fraudster to make
an urgent deposit of the cash in order to secure the said vehicle urgently. He
was further convinced that the vehicle documents will be prepared for him
immediately after the payment. He then excitedly made the deposit and
unfortunately that was the last time he heard from the suspect.” Zuma urged the public to approach reputable businesses,
shops or car dealerships whenever they want to make purchases. “They must conduct a proper research rather than naively
relying on advertisements displayed on social media,” said Zuma.
