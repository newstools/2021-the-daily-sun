THE store sells milk, but when cops raided the place following a tip-off they found booze being sold there. . . in potato bags! Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said two men were bust on Monday! They arrested the store manager and another thirsty-looking man, who was presumably there to buy the booze. “The store manager, aged 54, was fined R5 000 while a R1 000 fine was imposed on the 50-year-old customer,” said Mokgwabone. Police confiscated liquor worth R16 250! GANGSTER GOGO WANTED! Meanwhile, a shebeen queen in Klerksdorp sympathised with the suspects. “We sell liquor so we can feed our children and help out people who work in our taverns, but the president closed us down. Just like that.” Motheo Maruping, who seemingly will stop at nothing to get tipsy or poepdronk for all time’s sake, is used to the pricey liquor. “The president closed on the day of the announcement, but we don’t know when liquor sales will resume,” he said. “We’re all afraid of the coronavirus, but liquor doesn’t increase infections. It depends on behaviour.” Sporo Ntuli asked that liquor places be opened and that takeaways be an option. “How about not having sit-in customers but be given an opportunity to buy and drink at home to avoid crowding in taverns.”
