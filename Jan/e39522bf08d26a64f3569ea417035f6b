YOU haven’t seen the best of me! So said Peter Shalulile after he banged in two goals that
secured Mamelodi Sundowns a hard-fought 2-1 league win against Black Leopards
at Thohoyandou Stadium last night. Shalulile helped the team break their three-match winless
streak. “It wasn’t an easy game. But we kept believing and it
paid off,” said Shalulile afterwards. “Credit to my teammates. With one man down you, have to work
extra hard and grind out a result. You haven’t seen the best of me.” Never in his wildest imagination did Lehlohonolo Seema
think he’d be guiding Black Leopards against Sundowns this season. But there he was last night barking instructions as Black
Leopards went down to the Brazilians. It is the sizeable task facing Seema at Lidoda Duvha,
brought in from Chippa United just weeks ago to assist Dylan Kerr who has
already been fired. The loss wasn’t a result Seema and his co-coach Morgan
Shivambu were looking for at home, not after Leopards shocked Orlando Pirates
here a fortnight ago. They probably fancied themselves another big scalp and
they looked driven to cause another upset, seen as Ovidy Karuru slid in the
opener in the first half from a Sibusiso Khumalo cross. It wasn’t until the hour mark that Sundowns found the
back of the net, Shalulile thundering in the equaliser in the 66th
minute. The Namibian international grabbed the winner in stoppage
time for the visitors, who were a man down after Mthobi Mvala was given the
marching orders for his pulling Rodney Ramagalela. But for Seema, the nightmare may as well have started. His trigger-happy frown upon such results. It wasn’t a poor performance from the home side against a
star-studded side, who had to grind out a result. There were opportunities for Ramagalela, Denis Onyango
pulling off stupendous saves. King Ndlovu also kept his side in the game for longer
with no fewer than three crucial saves, denying Gaston Sirino and Themba Zwane. But Shalulile was the man of the match.
