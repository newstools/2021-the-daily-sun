THE Covid-19 pandemic has hit the entertainment industry hard. Speaking to Daily Sun, Zodwa Wabantu said she decided to open a business selling chickens and eggs in order to stay afloat. “We don’t know what the future holds for artists, and I don’t want to be broke. That’s my biggest fear. I had to be proactive and think of other ways to make money,” she shared. Zodwa will be selling live chickens and branded eggs. “My business will be based in Mpumalanga. But for now, while I’m in Joburg, I’ll be selling from the back of my car.” Zodwa told the SunTeam that her first customer was Kelly Khumalo, who bought two chickens on Sunday.

I’ll be adding more tray sizes as time goes by.” The well-known entertainer and hands-on businesswoman proudly shared that she already had eight employees. “Times are tough and people need to eat. So I’m happy that I’ll be putting bread on someone else’s table by employing people.” Zodwa pleaded with people to take the virus seriously, sharing that she’d just lost her aunt. “Covid-19 is real. I pray that people follow the instructions they were given to stay safe. You never understand its intensity until it hits home. Stay safe. Our lives are more important than groove,” she said.
