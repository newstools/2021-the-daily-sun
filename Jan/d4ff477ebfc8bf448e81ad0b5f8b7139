IT might be early days in the GladAfrica Championship but JDR Stars chairman Nditsheni Nemasisi has set a target for the first round of 15 fixtures. Nemasisi said he wants the club to accumulate 30 points after the first round of matches. The Tshwane-based outfit are the early pace setters, leading the standings with 15 points from their opening eight fixtures. Also known as Hammer Boyz, Stars are within their chairman’s target as the remaining seven games (21 points) in the first round can take them to 36 points if they win all those matches. Nemasisi said: “It’s my wish that we compete for automatic promotion. But we don’t want to get carried away too early and undermine the other competitors. “We are going to focus on a game by game basis and collect as many points as possible. “We will be happy if we go above 30 points in the first round (first 15 games) because that will mean we have less work to do in the second round.” Nemasisi and his club are in their second stint in the Mzansi second tier. Last season they finished seventh. Now they will be hoping to improve on that and win the championship. “I think we’ve got depth. We made a few experienced signings. “Bafana Kali is scoring every game, Muziwokuthula Zimu as well. They are showing (their experience) that they have been in this league,” Nemasisi added. On Tuesday JDR brushed aside Polokwane City 2-1 in a win that saw them maintain their place at the top of the table. On Saturday the Hammer Boyz host Cape Town Spurs at Giant Stadium in Soshanguve (3.30pm).
