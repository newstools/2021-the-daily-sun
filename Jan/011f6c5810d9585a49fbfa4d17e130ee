THEY realised no one was going to do it for them if they didn’t do it themselves. So over the weekend residents of Diepkloof zone 4 in Soweto, who were tired of waiting for services, fixed a STOP sign themselves. It was removed by nyaope boys in October and Daily Sun published an article after Mpho Hlahane stopped the thieves shortly after they removed the road sign. Mpho said the kasi also suffered at the hands of burglars, but the community had that under control. He couldn’t let thieves walk away with the road sign as their kasi had been ridden with accidents. “Now that the criminals have no chance of breaking into our homes, they resort to stealing anything metallic they come across. “They sell it at a scrapyard so they can get cash for their next fix,” he said.  He got worried when government made no contact with him as he’d kept the sign so it could be fixed. “My neighbour, whom I had complained to about the sign, offered to try and put it back,” said Mpho. The neighbour, who only said his name is Bo-Boyz, said he’s a concerned community member. That’s why he took a chance and fixed the sign.  “We have children that we need to keep safe, and government has failed this kasi many times before. “We even built our own STOP signs because government clearly wasn’t concerned about all the accidents that were occurring.” Bo-Boyz warned those who advertised their businesses on road signs to stop.
