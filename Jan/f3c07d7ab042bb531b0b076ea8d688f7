THE GladAfrica championship has not been friendly with former Premier Soccer League sides. One can read between the lines that the 2020-21 season will be a rough ride for the likes of Free State Stars and Cape Town Spurs, formally known as Ajax Cape Town. After five matches, both teams are yet to win a match. They’re lying in position 16 and 15, respectively – with two points each. Before the season started, Ajax were hoping for a win after failing to retain their top-flight status twice. In 2018-19, they missed out on a promotion spot on the last day of the campaign when they finished fourth. The 2019-20 season was one to forget as they lost the league title and automatic promotion to the elite league also on the last day of the season. They finished second and things went south for them in the promotion/relegation play-offs. Spurs coach Vladislav Heric admitted that this will be one of the toughest campaigns. “There’ll be a lot of ups and downs this season. None of us can prepare or rectify mistakes, because we are having one or two training sessions and that is not enough to change things.,” he said. Bethlehem-based Stars recently appointed Allan Freese as their head coach and is expected to turn things around. Stars host another former DStv Premiership side the University of Pretoria on Sunday (3.30pm). “One can do so much. It’s the players who can turn the tables,” Freese said. he is pinning hopes on the players to turn around the situation, get their first win of the season and that demands hard work. “Everything takes hard work and dedication,” he said.
