BLACK Leopards defender Edwin Gyimah reckons their shock win over Orlando Pirates could be a sign of good things to come this season. The 29-year-old Ghanaian put in a man of the match performance against his former team to help Lidoda Duvha walk away 2-0 winners at the weekend. The win was only the second of the season for the Limpopo outfit and it saw them move away from the relegation zone. They now sit in 14th spot with nine points from ten matches, a solitary point away from the dreaded drop zone. Nevertheless, Gyimah is hoping Lidoda Duvha have turned the corner and will go from strength to strength henceforth. He insists that it has been a long time coming and that this is only the beginning of their resurgence. “When you check our previous matches you will see that we have been doing well,” said Gyimah. “We have just been making some small mistakes that cost us but collectively we have been doing well. “We can only grow from now on, we have a lot of quality in this team and it will continue to show. “It’s a start of good things for the team, the team is improving and we believe there are better days ahead.” Gyimah dedicated their win over Pirates to Leopards boss David Thidiela who is “going through a tough time.” Gyimah says they are determined to make Thidiela and the club’s supporters happy. They will be looking to pick up from where they left off against Bucs when they face Cape Town City at Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday (5 pm). “We had a meeting with the chairman and I think everyone listened and understood what the chairman wants from us,” added Gyimah. “We know that he is going through a difficult period but if we continue to play like this then we can make him very happy.” Leopards will face a City team that will be looking to bounce back from a defeat to Kaizer Chiefs. Citizens coach Johannes Olde Riekerink will be looking to unleash new striker Justin Shonga against Lidoda Duvha.
