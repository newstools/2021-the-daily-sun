WHAT started out as a joke about gospel star Thinah Zungu’s double-storey house recently turned ugly. The singer had been posting photos of his house on Facebook since he built it in 2019, but his fans became gatvol. Fans started attacking Thinah on Thursday after he posted more photos of the house and joking about having Gucci cockroaches. He also joked that he’d not be affected by 5G towers, the subject of all sorts of health scare claims, because he lives in a double-storey house. After his fans became angry, an apologetic Thinah wrote: “I’m sorry if I offended anyone with my house. I didn’t mean it. The thing is, I’m proud of my success. “At 33, I’ve managed to build a double-storey house. I’ll not post about it again because some people are not happy that a small boy has a double-storey house. I apologise.” The singer told Daily Sun he didn’t mean to brag and was just trying to motivate others. “I wanted to show people that no matter where you come from, you can also do it. “I didn’t mean to hurt them. That’s why I have apologised. “I’m happy that I did this against all odds. I managed to do this even though musicians are known as people with no money. “My construction company is doing well – that’s how I built the house.” Thinah said as a public figure, he felt it important to apologise. He said he made the joke about Gucci cockroaches because he wanted his followers to laugh when they saw his posts. “I’m a born entertainer and, because I don’t get a chance to entertain people on stage, I use social media to do so. I want those facing difficulties to laugh when they see my posts,” he said.
