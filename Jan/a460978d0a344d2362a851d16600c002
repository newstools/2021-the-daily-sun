Judas Moseamedi tormented Kaizer Chiefs once more as Maritzburg United claimed a morale-boosting 2-0 win over their hosts in a 2020-21 DStv Premiership match at FNB Stadium on Saturday. A second win in as many matches moved the Team of Choice up to 12th place on the league standings while Chiefs, who still have yet to win at home this season, dropped down to 14th, a point and place above the relegation zone. Following a first half in which the two teams could only conjure one shot on target between them, the second half produced all the drama expected on Ernst Middendorp's return to Soweto for the first time after being sacked by the Amakhosi at the end of last season. Chiefs were dealt a blow early in the second half as Khama Billiat was forced from the field with an injury, but there was some light at the end of the tunnel for the Soweto giants as Samir Nurkovic made his way onto the pitch on the hour mark, for his first league appearance of the campaign.Maritzburg hit the front in the 66th minute as Moseamedi got on the end of Gadinkame Modise's pin-point cross, glancing the ball past Daniel Akpeyi for his third goal of the campaign.Moseamedi completed his brace in the 79th minute. A long throw-in by Daniel Morgan found the towering forward who outmuscled Ramahlwe Mphahlele before finding a way past Akpeyi from an acute angle for his second double against the Glamour Boys in as many seasons.Chiefs pushed forward in search of a way back into the match in the closing stages, but Maritzburg's defence held firm as they claimed successive wins at FNB Stadium. -SuperSport
