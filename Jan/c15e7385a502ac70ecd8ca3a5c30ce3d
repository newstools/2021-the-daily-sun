HEALTH Minister Zweli Mkhize visited Limpopo on Wednesday, 20 January. He visited Mopani and Tshilidzini hospitals, Thohoyandou Health Centre and Thavani Mall. He said the province also had a staffing problem. “We have to intervene to ensure there’s an addition of human resources. We also have to look at how to open frozen posts,” he said. He said the number of people with Covid-19 suddenly surged in Limpopo. “The problem the staff has is the sudden rush of too many patients, and that puts a lot of pressure on them and leads to exhaustion,” said Mkhize.

Speaking at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital on Tuesday, 19 January, Mkhize said: “What happened is the filling up of private hospitals ahead of public hospitals. “We’re still trying to understand how this happened. At this point we had patients who were referred from the private sector to public hospitals, whereas we had made an agreement to refer patients to private hospitals, particularly to ICUs.” He said this referral was first seen in the Eastern Cape where private hospitals were full. “We ended up with medical aid patients being treated at field hospitals,” he said. Mkhize attributed the second wave to complacency and behavioural changes among young people. He said the new variant is not severe than the first but highly transmissible, and that means more people are infected. Staff at Charlotte Maxeke said they were under pressure, and the alcohol ban had allowed them to handle cases with ease. Hospital CEO Gladys Bogoshi said: “People who’re drunk abuse our health workers. “Health workers work hard, and the last thing they need is to be terrorised by patients.”
