EIGHT nurses at Mahikeng Provincial Hospital in the North West have tested positive for Covid-19. All the nurses worked in the maternity ward. Provincial health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said the ward was closed for decontamination and patients were transferred to nearby hospitals. This has caused panic at the hospital, with staff members saying the hospital should be shutdown. They said the hospital was full and there were no beds for patients. “I have never seen a situation like this. The situation became worse after New Year’s Day as we received a lot of patients than usual,” said a doctor. Another staff member said morale was down. “It’s bad. We all know that this is affecting the whole world, but we are scared. “Coming to work nowadays is like signing your death certificate,” she said. Lekgethwane said other parts of the hospital were still in operation. North West Health MEC Madoda Sambatha said with the numbers of daily infections and active cases rising, there was a need for all partners to participate in raising awareness and ensuring adherence to prevention measures. He said he’d continue with Covid-19 awareness and compliance campaigns across the province. So far, the North West has recorded 41 459 cases since the beginning of Covid-19, with 484 hospitalised patients and 577 deaths.
