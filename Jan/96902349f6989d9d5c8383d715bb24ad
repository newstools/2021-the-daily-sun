HIS famous song Tswang Tswang Tswang, written in the 1970s, is still heard at weddings and parties to this day. But the creative voice of Kori Moraba has been silenced forever. The legendary musician succumbed to Covid-19 related complications on Sunday night. The 73-year-old Moraba was planning to release more music and warn people about the dangers of Covid-19. Moraba was admitted to Netcare Bougainville Hospital in Tshwane two weeks before his death. According to his youngest daughter Joylene (23), Moraba and his wife Annastacia (57) were both hospitalised after they started vomiting. Joylene said her mother was admitted first and her father the next day. That’s when doctors broke the sad news to them: they’d both contracted the virus. Although her mother fully recovered, Moraba’s health deteriorated. “He spent eight days in ICU, and yesterday we received news he’d died,” she said. Joylene said they were in shock and devastated by his death. She said her dad, at the time of his death, was working on his last album – which she said was devoted to the coronavirus pandemic. “He was excited to have it released soon and was optimistic it would do well,” she said. Joylene told the People’s Paper they never imagined they’d also bear the brunt of the pandemic, saying her dad had always been careful. The family was still discussing funeral arrangements. Moraba rose to fame after he released the hit song Tswang Tswang Tswang in 1971. He leaves behind his wife and three children aged 21, 23 and 29. People were shocked after they learnt of his death. His younger sister Nonhlanhla “Mdonso” Ngcobo, a presenter on Ukhozi FM, told Daily Sun her brother fell ill on Thursday, 31 December.
