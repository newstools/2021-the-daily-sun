 LESEDI Kapinga could face his former team Black Leopards for
the first time since joining Mamelodi Sundowns. The two DStv Premiership will clash at the Thohoyandou
Stadium on Wednesday afternoon (5pm). Kapinga joined Sundowns in July last year from Lidoda Duvha,
and he is in line to face his former side. The 25-year-old has made six league appearances for Sundowns
and has been pushing hard to command a regular place in the star-studded team. Kapinga says he respects Sundowns. Kapinga said: “I have too much respect for Black Leopards,
this is the team that gave me a platform to play at a high stage when no team
wanted to try me in the DStv Premiership because of the size of my body, so I
will forever be grateful. "We know that is going to be a difficult game, but we
have to get the three points because the target is to win the league." Despite not getting a win in their last three matches where
they played draws against SuperSport United, Bloemfontein Celtic and Swallows
FC, Sundowns remain top of the Premiership standings. They have accumulated 27 points from 13 matches, while their
opponents, Leopards are second from the bottom of the table with just nine
points after the same (13) number of matches. Kapinga added: “Every player is working very hard giving
their best which tells you that the group is headed in one direction, which is
to win games. “As for me, I’m regaining my confidence with each game that
I play under the leadership of coaches, and guidance from senior players”. “As a team, I think we are doing well so far. We still have
our unbeaten record which is a good thing.
