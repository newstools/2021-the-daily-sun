A WOMAN (34) and her daughter (14) were lucky to survive after being stabbed more than 19 times. This happened while they were sleeping in their RDP in Dingleydale Village, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on 15 November last year. The accused handed himself over to police last week and made a short appearance in the Mhala Magistrates Court on Thursday. Said his lawyer Peter Malibe: “It’s my humble submission that this court have this matter remanded in order to verify my client’s alternative address.” Both mother and daughter spent weeks in hospital. Magistrate Robert Mokone remanded the case until 5 February for a formal bail application.
