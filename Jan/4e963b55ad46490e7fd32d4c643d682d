A SENIOR prosecutor at the East London Magistrates Court will appear in the same court on Thursday, 14 January for fraud and defeating the ends of justice. Police spokesman, Thembinkosi Kinana, said detectives in 2016 received reports of missing court dockets in the East London Magistrates Court. An investigation was launched and, in one case of drunken driving, the victim was asked to pay a sum of R20 000 in exchange for the destruction of the docket. “Consequently, the said docket went missing,” he said. Police were able to reconstruct the docket and were ready to bring it before court, but the suspect again alleged started persuading his victim to pay more money: this time a sum of R5 000 so the reconstructed docket could be destroyed as well. This brought the amount pocketed from the victim to R25 000 in total. After a long process of investigation which started in 2019 by the anti-corruption unit, during which the 50-year-old suspect was evading arrest, an intensive search was conducted and he was found and arrested. Following the arrest, Eastern Cape acting commissioner, Major-General Thembisile Patekile, said: “Reports of civil servants being involved in corrupt activities are disturbing. These people are expected to uphold the law and protect the image and resources of government by ensuring justice is served and service delivery isn’t compromised.”
