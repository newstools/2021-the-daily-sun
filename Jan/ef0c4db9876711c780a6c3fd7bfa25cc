OLYMPIC silver medalist Luvo Manyonga has been suspended for whereabouts failure, Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) on Friday after the body announced has announced. “The AIU has charged Luvo Manyonga of South Africa for whereabouts failures, a violation of the World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules. The long jumper has been provisionally suspended,” the body tweeted. The Manyonga the world long jump and Commonwealth champion, has been charged by the Athletics Integrity Unit after missing three tests in a 12-month period. Normally the penalty for whereabouts failures is a two-year ban. However, the 30-year-old has been banned for 18 months after giving a positive doping test in-competition at a national series meet in 2012. That means if Manyonga is unable to provide an adequate explanation for his missed tests it will be regarded as a second offence and his ban would likely be four years if found guilty. This could see him miss out of 2021 Tokyo Olympics.
