three suspects, aged 30, 40 and 44, were arrested for unlawful possession of dagga estimated at a street value of R50 000. Gauteng Traffic Police spokesman Sello Maremane said this happened in Alberton North in Ekurhuleni on Thursday (14 January). “The suspects are currently detained at Alberton Police Station and are expected to appear in the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court soon to face charges relating to unlawful possession and dealing in dagga,” said Maremane. He said the Gauteng Traffic Police will continue to root out all criminal elements within the province. “Dealing in dagga or drugs is not acceptable, and therefore punishable,” he said. “These illegal substances are some one of the many contributors of crime and have far reaching implications,’’ he said. Maremane also said anyone found in possession of illegal substances such as dagga or drugs must know the police will not hesitate to deal decisively with them. “We urge residents to report all criminal elements without fail to ensure the rule of law and order is maintained,” he said.
