Lotus residents from Gugulethu in Cape Town have destroyed and burnt the belongings of a dance instructor accused of raping more than seven girls he teaches. Councillor Sonwabo Ngxumza said he received a call on Saturday where he was informed about the matter. “A committee member informed me about this and I was shocked because we supported him with everything he needed concerning the dance group,” said Ngxumza. He said the suspect seemed very quiet and respectful. “We supported him because we thought he was taking kids off the street by teaching them how to dance. We never thought he could do something like this. Our mandate is to support victims and that is exactly what we are going to do until the law takes its course,” he said. Thembinkosi Bhala, a street committee member, said the residents not only burnt and destroyed the suspect’s shack, but also his wife’s shack. “Apparently one parent saw naughty messages in their kid’s cellphone. They were from the suspect. That is when he was exposed about what he has been doing,” said Thembinkosi. He said that’s when the parent asked other kids and they said the suspect has also been raping them. A resident said: “Residents were not supposed to destroy his wife’s shack because there is no way she knew about what was happening.” She said the suspect was separated from his wife, who’s currently in the Eastern Cape, but they had fixed things and recently got back together. “That woman needs support together with these kids,” said the resident. Colonel Andre Traut said a 38-year-old dance instructor was arrested in Gugulethu following the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl. “The circumstances surrounding the case are under investigation,” said Traut.
