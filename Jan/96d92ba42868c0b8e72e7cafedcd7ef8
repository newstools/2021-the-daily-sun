THE South African Federation of Trade Unions has called for President Cyril Ramaphosa to appear before the Zondo Commission. This comes after Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe implicated Ramaphosa at the state capture inquiry on Friday 15 January. “Saftu calls on the Zondo Commission to request the audience of President Ramaphosa and all the directors of the firms, Glencore and Optimum, to testify in order to be provided an opportunity to put forward their side of the story,” said Saftu earlier on Saturday (16 January).  Molefe alleged that after Glencore sold shares of one of its companies, Optimum Coal Mine, Ramaphosa became the local board chairman. He alleged that Ramaphosa was made the board chairman of Optimum, allegedly so he could use his political connections to secure business. Molefe alleged that in 2014 Ramaphosa then became the chair of the government’s Eskom War Room, designed to halt the loadshedding crisis. This, he said, was a conflict of interest since Ramaphosa had 9,4% shareholding in Optimum which was doing business with Eskom. Saftu said they understand that Judge Raymond Zondo is in isolation after a staff member tested positive for Covid-19 but they want him to act as soon he is available. “If he is well next week and if he is able to work remotely, we join the rest of South Africa in desiring full transparency about President Ramaphosa’s behaviour as a corporate tycoon, allegedly influencing our state on behalf of international capitalists. The allegations made by Molefe are certainly damning! He offered a different narrative to the notion that state capture occurred purely via the Gupta empire,” the union said.
