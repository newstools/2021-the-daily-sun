FAKE COVID-19 certificates remain a problem at the Lebombo Border Post. Mpumalanga community safety MEC Gabisile Tshabalala paid the border a visit on Sunday to monitor compliance and traffic as people were making their way into South Africa. Tshabalala said the province was worried about the increasing number of fake certificates produced by Mozambican nationals. “This will compromise the health of the people of this province and those throughout the country. This means we must enforce compliance and be vigilant,” she said. Hundreds of people have been queueing for up to three days to test for Covid-19 within the border premises. About six have tested positive for the virus. “There’s a stampede already. Because people are exhausted, they’re not observing the issue of social distancing. The situation is very risky,” she said. Akhona Maphasa, who was coming back from Mozambique, said he was forced to do another Covid-19 test, even though his certificate was still valid. “I was supposed to be at work today. I didn’t even stay for 14 days, but they told us that we needed to test with private companies,” he said Maphasa, who has been queueing since Saturday, said it was frustrating that he needed to pay for another certificate, especially because he couldn’t afford to pay for it. “I’m not happy with the way they work. This process delays everything. People who were supposed to be at work today are still here trying to make their way out. This is frustrating.”
