THE hectic DStv Premiership schedule has AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy worrying over the fitness of key players ahead of their clash against Stellenbosch FC at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Friday (5pm). McCarthy is sweating over the fitness of Thembela Sikhakhane, Limbikani Mzava and Augustine Mulenga, who picked up injuries in the last two matches against SuperSport United and Baroka. Usuthu drew 1-1 against SuperSport and beat Baroka 2-0. Mulenga was not able to finish the game against SuperSport last Wednesday. He was replaced in 66th minute by Mario Booysen. The former Orlando Pirates striker, who is a great addition to the side, missed the previous game against Maritzburg United and was also absent when Usuthu beat Baroka this past weekend. Mzava last played against Maritzburg on the 17 January and has missed the last two matches. Sikhakhane missed the match against Baroka and McCarthy has his fingers crossed that they’ll be fit when they host the Stellies. “That’s what happens when you play every three days,” said McCarthy. “There’s high intensity and the conditions are a bit different with what we are accustomed to. “They have to adapt and the recovery process is very important. “I think what has helped was that I was able to try and get all the players on par with their fitness so that we are able to make changes.”
