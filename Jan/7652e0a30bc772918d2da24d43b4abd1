Siviwe Jaka (34), a resident who witnessed the incident, said he was walking around with his child when he heard a police siren. “The driver of the car was speeding with cops behind him but he could not negotiate the speed hump since it was huge. His car then crashed into a shack. He managed to open the door and run away but cops chased him,” said Siviwe. Community leader Zoliswa Libalele said it is not the first time cars have crashed into people’s homes ekasi.  “It is a common occurrence because of young boys who rob metered taxis around here. When they take the cars they then start speeding around kasi, crashing into people’s fences and shacks. Residents, using their own cash, erected huge speed humps to ensure these kids don’t speed around. Others barricaded their roads, and cars don’t drive there anymore,” said Libalele.
