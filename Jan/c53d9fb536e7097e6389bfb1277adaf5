WHILE Covid-19 ravaged Mzansi, hundreds of desperate Sassa beneficiaries gathered outside Gugulethu Sassa offices in Cape Town. Some were in wheelchairs and others with crutches, sitting and standing, hoping to get helped with problems regarding their grants. They slept on cardboards in the queue, with no toilets or water available. Wheelchair-bound gogo Nomaindia Qwayi (73) from Crossroads told the SunTeam that she started queueing on Monday and slept there. “I slept in my wheelchair. I need to renew my grant, but I was also here last Tuesday and given an appointment to come today,” she said. Beneficiary Zoliswa Luwaca (36) said: “You queue to get an appointment. When you get the appointment you queue again. It’s a horrible experience.” Western Cape regional Sassa spokeswoman Shivani Wahab said the influx was caused by temporary disability grants that had recently lapsed. These grants were awarded where the applicant’s medical condition was likely to improve. The social grant was awarded for six to 12 months, and then the applicant had to reapply. “Sassa can confirm that for the Western Cape, there’s a total of 53 000 lapsed disability grants at the moment. These were awarded on a temporary basis. “Technically, they lapsed last year in February, but Cabinet decided to extend the payment until December 2020 to cushion clients against the economic hardship of the lockdown. The cost of extending these grants last year totalled more than R1,5 billion,” she said. Wahab said Sassa would give all applicants an appointment to finalise their application. “Clients will not have to wait in endless queues. “They have been warned by management many times on the dangers of sleeping at any contact point.”
