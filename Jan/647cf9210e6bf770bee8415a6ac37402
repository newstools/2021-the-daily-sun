AMAZULU defender Limbikani Mzava says they don’t care that Kaizer Chiefs are going through a rough period this season. The former Golden Arrows defender, who joined Usuthu during the off season from now defunct Highlands Park, revealed they won’t be any sympathy as they want to get the three points. These two old foes clash in a DStv Premiership match at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium today (3pm). “We have to take advantage because it is our home game and I know people will say, ‘Chiefs are not in a good position, not performing and all that’, but in football, you can’t just talk, you need to perform on the field,’’ said Mzava. “We have one goal as a team and we have to win this game. We don’t care if they are down or they are not doing well, but we are focusing on each and every game to collect points.” Chiefs are going through a terrible time under coach Gavin Hunt and their struggles were summed by their goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi who said the dressing room has been like a cemetery. Amakhosi are third bottom with seven points from nine matches. They have not won a league match since beating Chippa United on 27 October via an own goal. Their league winless streak stretches to seven games now. The Soweto giants’ last league game was a 2-0 loss at home to Maritzburg United this past weekend. Usuthu are in better shape. They go to this game having drawn against Bloemfontein Celtic in their previous game and lie ninth on the table with 10 points from nine games. Usuthu will fancy their chances against Chiefs having picked up four points in the two games since new coach Benni McCarthy has been in charge. Mzava says things are slowly falling together.  “With how Benni wants us to play, we are adjusting to it well. In the next four or five games, I think we’ll be perfect.”
