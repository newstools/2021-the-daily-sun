THE impact of Covid-19 has left health workers at breaking point. Nurses said challenges faced by the health sector were at a critical stage. A nurse from a hospital in Rustenburg, North West said exhaustion was one of their many challenges. “Most of us are experiencing fatigue. We were denied our annual leave due to Covid-19. She said most hospitals were full, with no beds and PPE. “Patients complained about a lack of small things like toilet paper. If there’s a lack of toilet paper in a health facility, what about PPE or ventilators? “The fears of infection among nursing staff is real. Admissions continue to rise on a daily basis. We encourage people to wear their masks and sanitise.” North West Health spokesman Tebogo Lekgetwane said nine nurses at the Mahikeng Provincial Hospital maternity ward tested positive for Covid-19. Lekgetwane said this put them under pressure. “Patients had to be allocated to various facilities to receive medical help.” North West has a total of 43 159 Covid-19 cases, 993 new cases, 6 958 active cases, 35 553 recoveries and 648 deaths.
