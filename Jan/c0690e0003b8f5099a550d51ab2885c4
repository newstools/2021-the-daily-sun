Controversial former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe appeared before the Zondo Commission last Friday. Molefe, who was on fire, held nothing back. What captured my imagination was when he said Chief Justice Raymond Zondo’s utterances gave the impression he’d already made a conclusion. That’s bold! He shared that President Cyril Ramaphosa was chairman of Glencore before becoming deputy president, and that the company conducted business with Eskom. Yet that was not under scrutiny. “Why?” he asked. Molefe indicated he wrote a letter to the commission in May last year, expressing his desire to appear but received no response. Surprisingly, last December he was summoned to appear. When he asked why, there was no answer. A few days before the appearance, the commission sent him a big file to prepare. Is that fair? In the absence of an explanation, the commission had left the public to draw its own conclusion on the matter, which was wrong. This left me with an impression the commission is biased. I hope I’m wrong.
