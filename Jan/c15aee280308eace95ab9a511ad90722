 Taiwan resident’s squatter camp in Khayelitsha, Cape Town
lost left homeless after fire destroyed their houses. The incident happened Friday around 20:55. Nozuko Nyakombi a
34-year-old resident said they were already in bed when the fire started. "Since the lockdown regulations bound us to be inside
at 21:00 everyone was already asleep while others were still watching TV,"
said Nyakombi. She doesn’t know what started the fire: “No one knows what
started the fire and it has been always like this for years, even though know
they are the reason, but they never came forward to admit to what they have
done.” Nosisi Mbovane a 43-year-old said they slept outside because
they do not have anywhere else to go. “We cannot ask other people for a place to sleep because of
Covid-19, we are all afraid of it and not blaming them”, said she said. She said more than 100 shacks were destroyed by the fire. “We need help, we have left with nothing”, said Mbovane. Bonke Satu told Daily Sun that from what he heard the fire
was started by a jealousy boyfriend. “We lost everything because of one stupid mistake, we are
all suffering because of other people’s insecurities”, said Satu. He said people need to think about the consequences before
doing anything stupid. He said before people take a decision to burn their lover's
shacks they must think about other people. “We have elderly
people here who had nothing to do with their affairs, including us, why must we
suffer for other people’s affairs, this is not fair, and it needs to be
stopped”, added Satu. Jemarnie Carelse
spokesperson from the City’s Fire & Rescue Services said the fire destroyed
141 structures and 11 formal houses leaving 400 people affected. “No emergency
sheltering was activated”, said Carelse. He said residents are staying with
family and friends. “SASSA has been informed to provide humanitarian assistance
and the City’s Departments are on the scene assisting the affected community,”added
Carelse.
