MUSICIAN Mbuzeni Mkhize is teaching Mzansi to know the difference between culture and women abuse. He’s released a song titled Nduna, which asks traditional leaders to stop turning a blind eye while abusive men practise ukuthwala. The maskandi artist from Umkomaas, on the KZN South Coast, urged residents to call the police on people who practise ukuthwala. Mzansi is faced with high rates of women abuse, as well as rape and killings. He believes the unlawful cultural practice can be stopped if everyone fights it. ALSO READ: PASTOR SURVIVES CAR ACCIDENT! He told SunBuzz it’s disappointing that in the rural areas, when parents report ukuthwala matters to izinduna, the parents are told to wait for marriage negotiators. “How can parents fold their hands waiting for abakhongi when they don’t know where their child is? “This is dangerous and traditional leaders must stop promoting this. Culture must protect everyone and not suit one gender.” “Men should propose to a woman respectfully and have an agreement without coercion. “When a man is sending abakhongi to the women’s home, he must be in agreement with the woman about his intention.” The talented guitarist said love is a beautiful thing that shouldn’t hurt anyone. Mbuzeni, who often travels overseas, was interrupted by the pandemic from recording a song with Barbadian singer, Rihanna.
