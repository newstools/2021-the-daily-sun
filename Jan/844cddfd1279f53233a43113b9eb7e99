AFTER attending many auditions hoping to clinch an acting role, actor Teboho Tsotetsi is elated to have finally found an acting job. Taking to his Instagram account, the actor had been auditioning for roles without success until he got his big break as Sanele in The Legacy. The show is produced by Tshedza Pictures. “This has been the best part of my career this far. I’ve always wanted to be on screen, acting outside of TV presenting and I’ve been auditioning for a while trying to land my first acting character and I finally did it,” he said. Teboho said the experience of finally doing something he loves was surreal, so much so that he had to pinch himself every day to check if he’s not dreaming. “Every day I have to pinch myself to accept the reality of one of my dreams coming true still unbelievable. Sanele is not different from me. “We are both beautiful and the rest you have to stay tuned to see and this scene just says a lot. More is coming,” he captioned a video of one of his scenes on the show.
