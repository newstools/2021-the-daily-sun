JOMO Cosmos owner-coach Jomo Sono has been impressed by his side’s promising start in the GladAfrica Championship. Before yesterday’s round of matches, Ezenkosi were perched second in the standings with 12 points after seven outings. They were level on points with leaders JDR Stars, only separated by goal difference. This is a dream start to a new season for Sono after having a tough time in the past two campaigns where they were among struggling sides. However, Sono warned his players not to get comfortable as the race has just began. “It is still early days. We cannot get excited. We need to carry on putting in the hard work,” he stressed. “We just need to take each game as it comes, pick up maximum points and see how far we will be able to go.” Amid the Covid-19 pandemic where players are tested every week, Sono admitted it will be a tough ride as they will not always have full squads due to many factors. He stated: “The first round of the season is always the toughest. All the teams want to get as many points as they can to avoid the pressure that comes with the second round where you find many battles (relegation, promotion play-off) and the battle for the title, which comes with automatic promotion. “From Wednesday, we play two matches a week and there will be injuries, suspensions and we might not have some players who test positive (for Covid-19). But we will try to remain consistent.” All eyes will be at Cosmos this season as they are expected to bounce back to the elite league. Last season Sono made a bold statement that he will retire if he fails to bounce back to the top-flight this season. Today Cosmos will be hoping to continue with their fine form when they visit TS Sporting at Kabokweni Stadium (2pm). Newbies Sekhukhune United and Pretoria Callies will also be in action as the new Babina Noko coach MacDonald Makhubedu will be hoping to bring back success at the Eastgate based club.
