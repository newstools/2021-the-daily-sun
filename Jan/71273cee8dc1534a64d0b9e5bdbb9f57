SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo has made it no secret that he is eyeing the title at the end of the season. Matsatsantsa a Pitori have been challenging for the title in the past few seasons, only to fall short near the finish line. This season Tembo said they have the energy to go all the way and end the dominance of the neighbours Mamelodi Sundowns. They had a golden opportunity to signal their intentions and move closer to the leaders Sundowns when the two sides met in the Tshwane derby on Saturday. But the encounter ended in a goalless draw, with both sides sharing the spoils. Tembo was not too disappointed by that result and he believes it was a step in the right direction. He reckons his side are still in a good position to challenge for the title, but insists they will take it one game at a time. They are now third on the DStv Premiership table with 23 points from 11 matches – two adrift of Downs and Swallows FC. “We have only played 11 matches and there are about 19 games to go, so there is a lot of football still to be played,” Tembo said.. “We are putting ourselves in a good position to be able to fight for the title and that’s all we can do. “I think the month of January is going to be very key for us, so it is important that we just focus on each game as it comes. “We just need to pull through and see how far we can go. It’s really just one game at a time. We have been close in the past two seasons, up until the end we have always had an opportunity mathematically. We just lacked that consistency, which we are trying to fix this season.” SuperSport are next in action on Wednesday (5pm) when they face AmaZulu at Lucas Moripe Stadium. “In terms of the composition of the squad we are quite happy,” added Tembo. “Unless of course something happens and we get a few injuries, then we will have to add but at the moment we are focused on getting the best out of what we have.”
