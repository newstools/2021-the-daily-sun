ALMOST five funerals take place in Silvertown in Bekkersdal, West Rand, every week. But residents feel their loved ones are not getting the respect they deserve. They say hearses get stuck when passing a muddy road in the area. “We once pushed a hearse out of the mud, and this didn’t sit well with us. “It was disrespectful,” said a resident. Residents said they felt the municipality didn’t respect them and were tired of begging for help. So last Friday they collected sand, soil and bricks to start working on the road. They filled the potholes and levelled the road with soil and sand. The SunTeam came across the busy group. “We’ve been waiting for the municipality, but it’s doing nothing to fix the road,” said another resident. The residents said what made the road worse was that a contractor left it in a bad condition. Community leader Ronnie Ngabanyena said: “The contractor left the road incomplete and the rain is making it difficult for cars to drive on the road.” Ngabanyena said they contacted the municipality, but were told there was no budget. Another resident, Maoule Khumalo (45), said the municipality didn’t care. “We’ll see them when they come for votes,” she said. Rand West municipality spokesman, Phillip Montshiwa said he will send information to the relevant department and he encouraged residents to take up a reponsibility of helping where there’s a need but must do so in a legal way.
