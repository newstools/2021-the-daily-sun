OFFICIALS at the Lebombo border post told Home Affairs deputy minister Njabulo Nzuza about their problems, one of them being that their laptops have been stolen. Nzuza visited the border post at Komatiport, Mpumalanga yesterday. This comes after a big increase in the number of travellers entering South Africa at several border post across Mzansi since last week. The officials told Nzuza that the laptops were meant to track and register immigrants. Meanwhile, the portfolio committee on home affairs has resolved to visit both Beitbridge and Lebombo border posts this week to see the progress on the alleviation of challenges that led to the delays that created congestion at the borders. At the Beitbridge post, also yesterday, the chairman of the portfolio committee, Advocate Bongani Bongo, said the committee was worried about the conditions people faced at the borders which posed both humanitarian and health risks. He said the visit will be used to talk to departments operating at the ports to find out if solutions have been found to solve challenges at these sites. He said both Beitbridge and Lebombo have always dealt with large numbers of travellers, even before Covid-19. “It’s alarming that they were facing the same challenges they had during the festive season,” he said. “The committee will find out if solutions to long queues and people without health documentation have been found.” He said the committee has called for an engagement with countries within the Southern African Development Community to develop a blueprint that will ensure smooth and efficient crossing at the borders. “This meeting will also get an update on engagements with neighbouring countries, especially regarding co-operation at ports of entry.” Bongo said they will also interact with staff at the borders and find out about the availability of PPE during the peak season, and talk to travellers and truck drivers to get first-hand reports of their circumstances.
