UKHOZI FM has been accused of corrupt and fraudulent practices. Khathide “Tshatha” Ngobe claimed on Saturday, he and the SABC station’s management conspired to cheat Shwi Nomtekhala’s Ngafa out of the Song of the Year prize in 2005. “Shwi Nomtekhala won the competition, but due to certain reasons Malaika’s 2Bob was named winner and Shwi Nomtekhala was placed in second place,” he said. “The duo’s song was huge on another level, but there were fears people might not accept a maskandi song. “The nation was expecting their song to be announced as song of the year, but management chose Malaika’s.” Khathide was responding to allegations first made by his friend, Khuzani Mpungose. After Tshatha made his comments, some maskandi fans said corruption had always been a problem at Ukhozi FM, while others warned he could be fired.

If any act of misconduct is proven, there will be consequences.”
