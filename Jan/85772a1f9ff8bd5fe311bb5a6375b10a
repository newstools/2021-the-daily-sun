ALL WOMEN, including the ones who’re strong and smart, should not allow themselves to become victims of abuse. “Women are being killed because they hope their man will change, but it never gets better,” said Nathi Tsutsu. “I PRAY EVERY WOMAN GOING THROUGH THIS TORMENT FINDS THE STRENGTH TO LEAVE.” Tsutsu has opened a case of domestic violence against her husband, 2016 Comrades Marathon champion, David Gatebe. She also has a protection order against him.

She claimed after a woman with whom he’s believed to be having an affair with started calling her and sending texts to her husband, he turned into a monster. “He started abusing me physically in July. He’d beat me up and leave the house for days. Sometimes I slept in my car when he locked me out of the house,” she alleged. “I’m suffering from depression. I’ve tried committing suicide. The pain I’ve endured is beyond explanation.” She claimed her husband is accusing her of using muthi.  “He took the candles I use to pray and started telling our neighbours false things,” she alleged. She said getting support makes it a little easier. “Knowing you have people who’re still in your corner is important. Abuse breaks you down altogether,” she said. The SunTeam made arrangements to meet Gatebe. His phone was off during the agreed time of the meeting. When the SunTeam drove to where he said we should meet, he was nowhere to be found and his phone went to voicemail. North West police spokesman, Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone, said two cases have been registered in Phokeng. “The first is for assault and the other for contravention of a protection order,” said Mokgwabone. “The second case is still under investigation and the suspect is yet to be arrested.”
