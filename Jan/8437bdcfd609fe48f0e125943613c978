A FORMER cop and a police clerk were arrested during a stop and search operation in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, on Wednesday 27 January. They were among four suspects who were nabbed with unlicensed firearms, large quantities of ammunition and police items. The suspects, who are aged between 23 and 26, are expected to appear in court on Friday (29 January) on charges of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Novela Potelwa said the stop and search operation was done by the police’s provincial integrated team in Harare. “Members of the team searched a vehicle with two occupants earlier in the evening and found an unlicensed firearm. Two suspects were arrested,” said Potelwa. She said further investigations led the police to the suspect’s house in Kuyasa, where an additional five unlicensed firearms, ammunition and other items including police uniform were discovered. Two more suspects were arrested,” said Potelwa. She said four pistols, a hunting rifle, a shotgun, two imitation firearms, an assortment of rounds of ammunition, projectiles, pistol primers, a firearm reloading machine, and cartridges were also confiscated. “As the investigation continues more charges could be added,” said Potelwa. Resident Manelisi Nkuntsu (45) said cops are the most dangerous people. “Residents are losing their lives because of these illegal firearms because the so-called police officers are thugs hiding in police uniform,” said Manelisi. Another resident said there are a lot of dirty cops. He said the government should impose harsher sentences on offenders. “Until they get harsher sentences, we’ll still have dirty SAPS members because they know nothing will happen to them.”
