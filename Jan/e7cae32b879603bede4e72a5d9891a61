A COUNCILLOR is living in fear since being attacked and kidnapped from his home on Thursday, 14 January. December Nkosi from Mahushu, outside White River in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun that he was kidnapped by residents demanding water. December said on the same day, residents blocked the roads with burning tyres and rocks to show their frustration over a lack of service delivery. He said after they destroyed water tanks, police were called. “I was home with my family when they came. They broke the windows and took me. I was dragged to the bushes and assaulted.” He said that he was rescued by police, but didn’t feel safe anymore. “I fear for my life. This shows that this wasn’t about service delivery. It goes beyond that. My family is traumatised.” Another councillor said she had been attacked by residents twice, and left with serious injuries. City of Mbombela spokesman Joseph Ngala condemned the attacks. “We strongly belive that this was politically motivated. You can’t be attacking councillors and vandalising the same infrastructure that provides you with the water you are protesting for. This is pure criminality,” he said. Ngala appealed to residents to stop destroying the little they had. He said the municipality was always available to engage. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a case of kidnapping was opened at the Masoyi Police Station, but no arrests had been made.
