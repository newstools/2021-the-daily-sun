KAIZER Chiefs workaholic striker Samir Nurkovic is looking forward to making an impact and potentially score his first goal in the Soweto derby. The DStv Premiership blockbuster between Amakhosi and Orlando Pirates will take the center stage on Saturday at Orlando Stadium (3pm). The Serbian striker will be facing Pirates for the third time since his arrival in Mzansi. However, he is yet to find the back of the net despite finishing as the club top goalscorer last season where he netted 13 goals. Nurkovic says he has had great experience of the derby, it is unfortunate this time that the would be no fans at the stadium. “My experience in the derby has been unbelievable thus far, he told the club website. “I have had the privilege to play three derbies last season and I am happy to be part of this derby again. He added: “Playing in front of 90 000 spectators is a dream come true for every player. It has exceeded all my expectations. “It is unfortunate that this derby will have no supporters at the same stadium, but I am sure they will be supporting us from home, playing without supporters is very different. They are always the 12th man and give us extra motivation. We really miss them at the stadium.” Chiefs are heading to this encounter hoping for revenge having lost 5-0 to Pirates in a two-legged MTN8 semifinal early this season. They are heading to this encounter unbeaten in their last five matches where they won three and drew twice. Nurkovic says they are only interested in getting maximum points. He stated: “It is full focus for Chiefs as we get ready for the clash with Pirates. “A big team like Kaizer Chiefs must only be interested in victories, that’s why we are going into this game just like every other game with full focus.”
