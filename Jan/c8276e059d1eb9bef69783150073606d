Not so long ago the ANC’s long-serving deputy secretary, Jessie Duarte, made a shocking statement suggesting that without the ANC South Africa could head into civil war. In other words, South Africa needs the ANC more than the ANC needs the country. Wow! The statement is false and it was not well thought out. Is this what has become of our “honourable politicians”? Duarte is a seasoned politician. So, why did she make such a shocking statement? Arrogance? The ANC is losing popularity with voters because of poor service delivery and it’s well aware of this. It’s desperate to hold on to power. That’s why its leader uttered such a statement. Since she made that statement, the ANC has said nothing. Silence means consent. Duarte’s statement can be likened to that of “if you vote for the official opposition party DA, apartheid will come back”. Or “if you vote for the DA, you’ll lose your social grants”. Duarte’s statement is an attempt by the governing party to manipulate the masses into voting for it. The objective is to make them vote out of fear. This is unethical. I hope voters see the statement for what it is: manipulation. Letter by Thabile Mange
