STELLENBOSCH FC are no pushovers! And teams facing the Cape Winelands outfit will get a run for their money. That’s according to their coach Steve Barker who was delighted by the “character, personality and identity” shown by his side against on-form Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. Stellies held the improving Amakhosi to a goalless draw at the Danie Craven Stadium, bringing their winning run to a halt. Barker’s charges could have even won the match had they been clinical enough against the Glamour Boys. Nevertheless, the former AmaZulu mentor was happy with what he saw and wants to see the same spirit in the remainder of the season. Stellies have blown hot and cold so far this season, collecting 15 points from their 13 matches. They have managed three wins, six draws and six losses. They currently occupy ninth spot on the DStv Premiership log table. “I think after conceding three in midweek and seven goals in the last five, we needed to tighten up and the clean sheet was definitely the target," Barker told SuperSport TV. “But credit must go to the team for the result against Chiefs. We showed our character, our personality, our identity. And that we're not a team that can be pushed over and that teams have to work to get a victory against us. “So we're really proud of the effort. Now we just need to take our chances and show a bit of composure in front of goal and we'll win matches." Barker’s charges are next in action on Friday (5pm) when they face his former team AmaZulu at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium. Barker is delighted that he will be able to call on youngster Ashley Du Preez who made his return from injury against Chiefs. The 23-year-old speedy forward gives Barker another exciting option in attack and will add more quality. “I thought Ashley did well on his return,” added Barker. “He's been out for over a month. He gave us 70 minutes and did well. He brings a lot of pace and energy and it was good to have him back.”
