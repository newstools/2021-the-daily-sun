RECKLESS behaviour will get you into trouble! This is the warning from the Gauteng Traffic Department following a 38-year-old man who was arrested for driving recklessly and being negligent. Gauteng Traffic Police spokesman Sello Maremane told Daily Sun that the man failed to obey a lawful instruction from a traffic officer. “He was also driving under the influence of alcohol,” he said. Maremane said a member of the Gauteng Traffic Police stopped the car in Rose Road, De Deur near Meyerton, south of Joburg, after noticing that it did not have a registration number in front. He said the driver failed to stop, which resulted in an officer sustaining serious leg injuries. The officer was receiving medical attention at a healthcare facility. “Officers who were patrolling in the area pursued the suspect and managed to stop him,” Maremane said. He said when the officers stopped the suspect, they screened him and found that he was driving under the influence of alcohol. Home-made alcohol was found in his possession. “The breathalyser indicated alcohol content of 0,79 milligram, three times over the legal limit of 0,24 milligram per 100 millilitres,” he said. Maremane told the People’s Paper that the suspect was arrested and kept at De Deur cops shop. He was expected to appear in the Meyerton Magistrate’s Court shortly, facing charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and failure to obey a lawful instruction, among others. Maremane said such incidents would not be tolerated. “Officers of the law are there to protect and serve our communities. “The law enforcement authorities will continue to root out barbaric behaviour from heartless drivers who are abusing and ill-treating our officers.”
