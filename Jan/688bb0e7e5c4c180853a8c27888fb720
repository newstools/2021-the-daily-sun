STHEMBILE is not new to the music scene. He started out singing kwaito and – like any sensible, businessminded artist – he’s gradually evolving. Sthembile Mtolo is cautiously latching onto the amapiano craze. To make things happen, the vocalist from Kanana, near Orkney in the North West, is trying out his luck in Gauteng. So who is Sthembile, really? He’s affectionately known by his stage name, Iceblog. His new amapiano single, Lento, is a hit on Gauteng community and commercial radio stations. He said the song is about partying. ALSO READ: END OF THE ROAD FOR ISIBAYA! He’s worked with DJ Latechnique from Tshwane, as well as Seun and Amanda from Kanana. Asked to tell SunBuzz more about his music career, he said: “My first album Ayipheli is strictly a blend of kwaito and house music. “It has messages of happiness and sadness. It stresses that kwaito is alive and that it won’t die that easily. “The album also carries the message that nothing is for free in this life. Nothing is for mahala.” The 10-track album has hit songs Bheja, Ayipheli and Aziwe, which had a good reception from Klerksdorp local radio station Star FM, as well as Motsweding FM. “We once had a music group, which didn’t materialise because of financial challenges, so I decided to go solo.” Iceblog recalled his early days, saying: “I started at the age of 13. I used to imitate the likes of Lucky Dube and Brenda Fassie. “My parents would always find me dancing and singing along to those old-time songs.” The ambitious artist has played alongside Mzansi’s musical greats. “I was happy to share the stage with well-known musicians Teargas, Chomee, DJ Cleo and Revolution, not to mention DJ Fisherman, Brickz and Tina,” he said. “I dearly wish to have my own record label one day, so that I can help up-and-coming musicians.”
