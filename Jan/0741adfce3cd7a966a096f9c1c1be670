A MUM tragically died while her child was injured in a freak accident that happened on Wednesday, 13 January on the N2 near Mdloti offramp in Durban, KZN. The mother was declared dead on the scene and her two-year-old child is in a critical condition in hospital. According to the dead woman’s husband, they were forced to stop on the third lane after the Jeep Grand Cherokee they were travelling in had a puncture. They got off the car and he was removing a spare tyre when a Land Rover crashed into his car before running over his wife and child. The occupants of the Land Rover were not injured. The mother was found lying on the highway about 40 metres away from the point of impact. The IPSS Medical Rescues advanced life support paramedics spokesman, Dylan Meyrick, said they found an adult man holding a young child in his arms. He said the child had sustained serious injuries and paramedics initiated advanced life support interventions, before transporting the child to Lenmed Ethekwini Hospital for further care. “Unfortunately, an adult woman showed no signs of life and was declared dead by paramedics,” he said. Meyrick said according to the driver of the vehicle, they were forced to stop in the centre of the N2 due to mechanical problems. “When the passenger holding her child exited the vehicle to go to place of safety, they were struck from behind, by another car,” he said.
