KAIZER Chiefs midfielder Lebogang Manyama is happy to be back on the field contributing towards his side’s recent resurgence. Amakhosi’s struggles this season have been well documented but they seem to be finally turning the corner. They have won three of their last four matches with one ending in a goalless draw. Chiefs have quickly gone from 14th to seventh on the DStv Premiership table. Manyama has missed most of the matches Chiefs have won but came back in time to contribute to their last win against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). He is now raring to go again and continue contributing towards the club’s turnaround. “I always want to play but I haven’t been able to do that consistently due to personal reasons,” said Manyama. “But I’m happy that the team was winning in my absence and I’m hoping to help out now that I’m back. “I’m still trying to get back to my best. There are positive signs and I hope to keep getting involved with goals and assists. “It’s not easy to play every three days but we just keep going. It doesn’t matter at the moment who is scoring as long as we win our matches.” Chiefs next face Baroka FC at FNB Stadium on Tuesday (5 pm).
