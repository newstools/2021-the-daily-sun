SOCIAL Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu refuted allegations that she instructed cops to spray old people with cannon water two weeks ago. On 15 January, cops used water cannons to spray at Sassa grant recipients who were gathered outside the offices in Bellville. The incident happened before Zulu’s visit to the same office, and she has been accused of being behind it. Zulu issued a statement refuting the allegations. “I would like to put it on record that I never instructed members of the SAPS to use spray water on the poor and vulnerable South Africans who were queueing outside the Bellville Sassa offices. As the minister of social development, I fully understand that social grants have been and continue to be a cushion for the most vulnerable in these difficult and unprecedented times,” she said.

Zulu said her visit was meant to deal with the issue of long queues and ensure that people receive their grants. “The allegations that I instructed police to use water cannon on the very same people I went to assist are not only false and misleading, but also designed to cast aspersions on my character and the organisation I represent,” added Zulu. Cape Town police spokeswoman Brigadier Novela Potelwa said the incident was being investigated. “Western Cape SAPS management met Sassa leadership in the province on Monday in a bid to resolve challenges that relate to large crowds of people converging in long queues at some offices within the Western Cape. Meanwhile, an internal SAPS inquiry into what transpired at the Bellville Sassa offices on Friday, 15 January, where police used water cannons on individuals standing in a long queue, is underway,” said Potelwa. Zulu met the portfolio committee on social development and told them that she was the one who stopped cops from spraying the beneficiaries.
