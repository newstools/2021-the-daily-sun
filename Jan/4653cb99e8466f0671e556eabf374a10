A COUNCILLOR in the Buffalo City Metro has been fired for her involvement in the sale of a property. Councillor Ntombizodwa Gamnca not only violated the Municipal Systems Act, but also has a criminal conviction for assaulting a councillor in 2019. Co-operative Governance spokesman Makhaya Komisa said regarding the incident she was found guilty of selling an RDP house. In the charge of assault, Komisa said she admitted that she assaulted someone and she was guilty. Co-operative Governance MEC Xolile Nqatha said Gamnca was given an opportunity to argue why she should not be dismissed. She said after considering her representation, she was removed from office. According to Nqatha, Gamnca violated the Code of Conduct for councillors which states that: “A councillor must, at all times, act in the best interest of the municipality and in such a way that integrity of the municipality is not compromised.” Nqatha said municipal speaker, Lifa Maxhegwana, was notified that Gamnca was expelled. Komisa said there was no room for corruption or fraud and when found to exist, it would be rooted out. Bathandwa Diamond of the Buffalo City Municipality had not responded to Daily Sun’s calls for comment at the time of going to print.
