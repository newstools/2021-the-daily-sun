A HOSPITAL has been accused of not telling the families of patients that they have Covid-19. Families claim they only find out the cause of death when they go to pick up bodies at Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp, North West. Nombulelo Biko told Daily Sun her father John was admitted on Sunday, 3 January with a lung infection. On Saturday, 9 January, she received a call saying he’d died. She said when she arrived at the hospital to pick up his body, she was not aware he had died of the virus. She said while her father was in hospital, staff kept assuring her family he was recovering. “We know Covid-19 is there and it kills. My father was very old but we needed to be told as we were taking care of him at home before he went to hospital. “We needed to trace family members who were with him before he was admitted,” she said. Sabina Seitisho, whose brother David died at the hospital, said she wished staff had been more considerate. “He had cancer and was transferred here from a private hospital on Tuesday, 5 January. “Finding out he had Covid-19 makes this a double tragedy,” she said. “Now we are not only focusing on the burial, but also on the fact that we might have the virus too.” The two families said there were a number of other families who experienced the same thing. They said it was difficult to lay a formal complaint because they were not allowed inside the hospital. North West Health Department spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said he had asked the hospital what happened and would make a formal comment after he had all the details.
