A Ben 10 handed himself to the police after he allegedly killed his 53-year-old wife and buried her in a shallow grave inside their shack. A 32-year-old man had a heated argument with his lover on Tuesday night (5 January), and there were concerns after there was no movement in their yard the following day (Wednesday). Concerned neighbours went to check on the couple on Thursday and upon arrival, they were greeted by blood stains on the windows. According to Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the neighbours forcibly opened the door where a shallow grave was discovered inside the shack. “The police were immediately called and the body of a 53-year-old woman was exhumed from the shallow grave that was dug inside the shack. A manhunt was launched and the suspect was arrested in the afternoon yesterday (Friday). “The killed woman is reportedly from KwaMashu in KZN and her identity cannot be divulged at this stage as her family is still being traced. The motive for the murder is unknown at this stage but domestic violence cannot be ruled out,” he said.  Mojapelo said the body of the woman was exhumed. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has strongly condemned this incident, calling it a horrendous crime against women. “The arrest of this suspect and the actions that were taken by the local residents are commendable and should send a clear message that perpetrators of gender-based violence and femicide will not have any place to hide. We therefore urge our communities to continue working with the police by reporting crimes that take place in their areas,” Ledwaba said.
