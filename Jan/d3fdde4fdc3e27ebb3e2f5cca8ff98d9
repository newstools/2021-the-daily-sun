ACTRESS Lindiwe Ndlovu was buried in her hometown of Hammarsdale, KZN, on Saturday. The Safta award-winning actress starred in many movies and dramas including Uzalo, Zabalaza and eHostela. She made her debut on Gomora last week. Her long-time friend and colleague in the industry, Nomathamsanqa Ngoma, said Lindiwe was also a good singer who spoke beautiful English. Nomathamsanqa told Daily Sun that they met when they were doing speech and drama at the Market Theatre in 1998. “She used to correct and teach us better English. When I spoke my broken English, she said she would help me because she could see I spoke like I’m from the Eastern Cape rural areas,” she said. Nomathamsanqa said while they were studying at the Market Theatre, they were called The Trio, along with Dudu Yende. “We sang in our class, with Lindiwe being the lead. In 2003, we travelled to Sweden with her to perform, and she excelled in both acting and singing. “She became my sister. We used to motivate and comfort each other when we were not getting work,” she said. “In our industry, we get depressed easily because our jobs are inconsistent. But she was always there for me.” Nomathamsanqa said Lindiwe was loving and caring , even in difficult times. “In 2010 I was shot in my house in Soweto and admitted to hospital. She visited me outside of visiting hours and when I asked how she got in, she said, ‘I know English, my friend’. “I ran away from Soweto after I was shot and she invited me to stay in her house. In 2014, when my son was shot, she was the one who comforted me,” she said. Lindiwe was laid to rest at Mophela Cemetery in Hammarsdale.
