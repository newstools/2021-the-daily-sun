A CAPE Town man was seriously injured after he was hit by a speeding car on Monday morning, 18 January near Maitland graveyard area. The incident happened at the corners of Voortrekker and Crematorium roads, used by people to access the cemetery and crematorium. Witnesses said the driver of the vehicle was speeding and could not stop when the injured man attempted to cross the road. “I think he thought the driver was seeing him when he was crossing. The driver was driving fast, going in the Bellville direction. There was no traffic jam on his side. The car hit him and he flew into the air and landed on the road surface,” said Jonathan Parker (45), who works in the area. A resident from the area said he had come to buy bread when the man was hit by the speeding car. “I think he was going to work because he had a bag with a lunch box. I hope he will recover,” said Janet Kamombo (34). When the SunTeam arrived, the Fire and Rescue team and cops were already attending the scene. Fire and Rescue spokesman Jermaine Carelse said: “We received the emergency call at 8.21am of a pedestrian (adult male) bleeding from his head in Voortrekker Road after he was hit by a motor vehicle. Epping’s fire crew and Milnerton’s rescue squad were dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival the officer in charge of Epping quickly assessed the patient,” he said. A paramedic from NetCare 911 arrived on the scene and treated the patient who was subsequently transported to a hospital in an ambulance at 9.30am. City of Cape Town traffic spokesman Richard Coleman confirmed the incident. He said the condition of the man was serious. Transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela recently expressed concern over the high numbers of pedestrians who were being killed on Western Cape roads.
