Sinethemba Nobanda (27) from Langa township in Cape Town lost everything in a mysterious fire. “When the fire broke out I was in hospital as I am not feeling well,” said Sinethemba. He said he received a call at around 1pm from his neighbours, informing him about the fire. “At first I thought it was something small but I was so shocked to find everything destroyed,” he said. According to Sinethemba, they couldn’t take anything out as the fire was too strong. “I would say the fire was caused by an electricity box but when they described it, it is clear it was vutha that was sent to kill me. “I don’t know who would want me dead because I am already sick,” he said. Sinethemba is pleading with SunReaders to help him fix his house. “I’m not working and I don’t even know where to start. “People won’t give me a place to stay because I am sick but I don’t blame them. All I need is assistance to at least fix my house,” he said.  His neighbour, Siyolise Luphunzi said they tried to stop the fire but they failed. “That fire was too strong. We tried everything but we couldn’t stop it. That is why all his belongings burnt to ashes,” she said. Siyolise told Daily Sun they were alerted of the fire by kids ekasi. “If it wasn’t for those kids maybe the fire would have affected other houses. We are sorry that we couldn’t assist him but we tried,” she said. She also believes the fire was sent to kill Sinethemba. “It was because of God’s grace that when the fire started he was in the hospital because we don’t know what might have happened if he was inside,” she said. She said Sinethemba’s always sleeping as he’s not feeling well. “At first we thought he was inside sleeping, but we were relieved when we heard that he is in hospital. The sad part is we cannot help with anything because we lost our jobs during the lockdown,” said Siyolise.
