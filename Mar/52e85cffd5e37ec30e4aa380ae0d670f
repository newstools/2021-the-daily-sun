The 53-year-old mum was allegedly murdered by her younger son (30) three months ago. The older brother said they suspected something wrong had happened on 24 December, four days after she was murdered. “I called her on 21 December hoping to find out when exactly she was coming home for Christmas, but her cellphone was on voicemail,” said the older brother. “I tried phoning her on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th, but her phone was still off. I then called our relatives and neighbours to go check if she was okay.” One of the people he sent to check up on his mum told him her house was locked. “When she last spoke to her on 20 December, she’d told her she was going to Bulwer for the Christmas holidays the next day. “After she said that I knew something was wrong. My mum would’ve arrived the same day had she left for Bulwer as she’d said,” he said. He said the neighbours started searching and noticed there was sand in the toilet in her yard. “They removed the sand, and when they were halfway, they picked up a rotting smell. A piece of clothing was beginning to show. “They stopped digging and called the police. On arrival the police continued digging and my mum’s bloodied body came out.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the suspect was expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrates Court soon.
