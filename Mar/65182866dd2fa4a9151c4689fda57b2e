WITS UNIVERSITY students have taken to the streets as they are facing National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) funding problems. NSFAS has not been able to confirm funding eligibility for first-time students entering public universities. The students say they want Wits University to allow students to register for the 2021 academic year, regardless of the amount they owe the institution for previous years.
