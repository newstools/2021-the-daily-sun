PARENTS have lost hope that Orefile Primary School in Olievenhoutbosch, Tshwane, will be fixed soon. They said they were scared the school would collapse on their kids. Parent Matome Phosa (47) said they wanted the ceiling fixed to avoid tragedy. He said they started reporting the damage in 2019, but nothing happened. “We don’t know how many times we reported the matter to the department, but no one seems to take us seriously,” he said. Another parent, Agnes Ndlovu (45), agreed with Matome that the ceiling needed to be fixed. “We can’t be sitting at home while we don’t have any assurance on the safety of our children at school,” she said. Agnes said the pupils felt cold in winter because of the exposed roofing. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the department was aware of the situation at Orefile. “Orefile primary is a school built from alternative construction technology in the Tshwane South district. “To this effect, we have appointed consultants as part of fixing structural damages at schools. “The work is not only exclusive to addressing ceiling damages, but also attending to structural challenges,” he said. Mabona said work will start in due course.
