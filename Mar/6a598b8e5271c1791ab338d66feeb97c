Dear MizzB MY girlfriend wants a threesome for her birthday. I want to give her everything that will make her day special, but I’m not comfortable with this. Could a threesome make us stronger or break us apart?  ) Brother Dear Brother Involving other people in your relationship is a gamble that can bring either good or bad results. Some people are happy to spice up their sex life and it does them good. But for others, things can just go downhill and they lose interest in each other. You should be comfortable enough to tell your partner how you feel and together decide what’s best. Who knows, she might just be testing you!
