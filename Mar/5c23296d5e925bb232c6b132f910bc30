 THINGS are just not happening
for Kaizer Chiefs! Gavin Hunt's charges extended
their winless run to six matches in the DStv Premiership as they were held to a
1-1 draw by Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday night. With Chiefs' biggest
tormentor in recent yearsâ€š Judas Moseamedi starting on the bench, Thabiso
Kutumela did the job founding the back of the net in the first 15 minutes of
the game. Bongokuhle Hlongwane should
have given United a second five minutes after that from a pin-point delivery by
Bandile Shandu, but his header missed the target. Ernst Middendorp and his
charges could have completed a double over Chiefs if they were clinical enough. Amakhosi managed to find a
late goal to get the point in the last two minutes of the match through
Lebogang Manyama's header to make it 1-1. The draw sees Amakhosi
dropping from position 10 to 1 in the standings as their struggles continue. In 18 league games which have
been very frustrating for Hunt on his first season with Amakhosi, they have
only managed to get 20 points. Chiefs' next league match
will be against Orlando Pirates in the Soweto derby on 21 March at FNB Stadium. On the other end, Maritzburg
United remain in the relegation dogfight. They are second from the bottom of
the table with 14 points. They are two ahead of Black
Leopards, who are languishing at the bottom with 12 points. In another league match that took place last
night, Golden Arrows leapfrogged SuperSport United and Orlando Pirates to a
second spot in the log standings after beating Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila 2-1
at Peter Mokaba Stadium. Goals from Knox Mutizwa and Siboniso Conco
ensured that Mandla Ncikazi's side collected valuable three points away from
home. Alfred Ndengane scored the consolation for the relegation-haunted
Tshakhuma.
