GAVIN Hunt certainly left Burkina Faso with many questions than answers about the herculean task he faces, both on the continent and the domestic front. But perhaps the overarching question for the beleaguered Kaizer Chiefs coach would be whether to continue stretching his limited squad with what looks to be a futile Caf Champions League exercise and rather focus on the PSL challenges. Battered and bruised, Kaizer Chiefs returned home from their Champions League outing in Ouagadougou where they were walloped 4-0 by Wydad Athletic on Sunday. Despite their challenges, as a result of their Fifa transfer ban, the Soweto giants have demonstrated an ambition to rise above them. But the latest result is certainly provided with some food for thought for Hunt and his charges. Sitting third with a single point in group C, Amakhosi still have four matches to turn around their campaign. But their challenges and limitations suggest it will take more than a pep-talk for them to realise success in their crusade for continental recognition. “The scoreline doesn’t look good,” said Hunt of the 4-0 drubbing. “I thought we had a couple of good opportunities to score. But we got caught by back post goals, the first two goals, the second and even the third. “All in all, we had a couple of opportunities on a difficult pitch, in a difficult situation. We kept going and got better in the second half, stronger, and had some good opportunities. But obviously, it wasn’t to be.” They will need to quickly dust themselves off and focus on the next match, against Pedro de Luanda who visit on Saturday.
