HUMAN anatomy is one of the most complex subjects we can try to fathom. The genetic makeup of both males and females have recently seemed to draw some similarities. For instance, men, like women, have breasts and can also develop breast cancer. The point is that women and men are more alike than we think. Take facial hair as an example. We’ve often thought that men are the only ones with beards but according Healthline magazine, some women have beards and here’s the reason why: Excessive hair that grows on a woman’s body and face is the result of a condition called hirsutism. Often likened to hypertrichosis, hirsutism is excess hair in areas where it’s typically seen in men, such as the face and lower abdomen. According to The Indian Journal of Dermatology, hirsutism affects between 5% and 10% of women. According to health experts, this condition tends to run in families, so you may be more likely to have unwanted hair growth if your mother, sister, or other female relative also has it. Women of Mediterranean, South Asian, and Middle Eastern heritage are also more likely to develop the condition. Dermatologists around the world agree that the presence of excess body hair can lead to feelings of self-consciousness, but it isn’t dangerous. However, the hormonal imbalance that can lead to it may compromise a woman’s health.
