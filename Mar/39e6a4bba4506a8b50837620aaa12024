MAMELODI Sundowns midfielder Grant Magerman says making his first start against Golden Arrows in the last league game of 2020 and being replaced before halftime was disheartening. Magerman, who joined Sundowns in October, says it was a huge disappointment because he wanted to make his imprint on the side. But he acknowledged that playing for a star-studded team like Sundowns if you don’t show what you are capable of when you are given a chance, such things do happen. The Brazilians sit unbeaten at the summit of the DStv Premiership. Sundowns have also steamrolled into the Caf Champions League knockout stages after winning four games in the group stages, without Magerman’s services. “I was a bit disappointed because as a footballer, you want to play most of the games,” said Magerman. “But for now I have to reflect and ask the coaches what more they expect from me and also in the position that I play. “Now it is all about adjusting in this environment. But bear in mind that Sundowns are the best club in the country,” said Magerman, who has played in only two league matches. “For me it is to adjust quickly and keep working hard, and hopefully when I get the chance, I make use of it.” In Downs’ first match of 2021 against Orlando Pirates, Magerman was on the bench. That was the last time he was part of the team. Since then, he has gone 11 domestic games without even being on the bench. “To be honest it is a bit difficult because the team is doing well. “But for me I just need to have faith and keep going. Hopefully, the coaches will see the work I’m doing,” said Magerman.
