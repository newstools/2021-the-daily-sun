ACTOR Thato Molamu has scored himself a presenting gig on Mzansi Wethu’s new show, Abazali. The new reality show is aimed at bringing alienated parents who can’t access their kids closer to them. Thato, who’s starred in dramas such as The Queen and Greed and Desire, will be the middleman who intervenes between two parents. He’ll speak to the parent who’s being denied access to their child, and the one who refuses to allow the alienated one an opportunity to be part of their child’s life. Mzansi Wethu explained how the show will work. “The 13-part reality show will play on Mzansi Wethu and will seek to ensure that in a conflict between abazali (parents), the interests of the child are safeguarded,” read the press release.
