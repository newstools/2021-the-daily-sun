Pole dancing is associated with sexy females and men with six-packs. But one Madala broke the norm by rocking the pole at a tavern. Usually, the site of ladies dancing on a pole sets tongues wagging. The madala in a suit has left many shocked and even questioning if Hammanskraal isn't hell because it seems like most of these shocking things are from there.  Levi Modise said people need to start locking their elders in their houses because they're doing shocking things. Even though some people are entertained, some see this as an embarrassment. "Imagine if this is your uncle and you stumble on him at groove, no man this is not good," said Levi. Lindiwe Mazibuko said she blames it on the alcohol and the song in the background. "This song makes people go crazy at groove, I just never thought I'd see a Madala working the pole like there's no tomorrow," said Lindiwe. "Anyway, he's just having fun and he's not stripping so let's enjoy the show," she added. Matshidiso Motseki said she wants to move to Hammanskraal because it seems like people are living their best lives. She said she can see that no one cares about what other people are doing, they're all just doing what they love and having fun while at it. "Yes this is a bit embarrassing but Madala is living his best life, let's let him enjoy, it's not like he's killing anyone," said Matshidiso. "I have seen it all shame and I'm very proud to confirm that I'll never leave my country, it's fun!" said Sipho Manana. He also said he's shocked at Mkhulu's behavior but he's happy to see him so happy. "He's just making the most of his remaining years. Let's go easy on the judgments," said Manana.
