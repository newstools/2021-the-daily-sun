LEARNING was disrupted at
Mzimba High School in Lephong Village outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge,
Mpumalanga on Thursday afternoon. This after pupils spotted a
black mamba in their classroom. But Cockroach Mdluli from
Bushbuckridge Local Municipality joined forces with Sabi Sand snake catchers to
remove the snake. Mdluli told Daily Sun
they were alerted by school teachers that there was a snake in one of the
classrooms, identified as a black mamba. “We rushed to the scene and
on arrival we found pupils waiting outside the classroom. The team from Sabi
Sand joined us in removing the snake. “The school is surrounded by
bushes and the snakes come for food which can cause harm to humans’ lives if
they provoke them. We want to warn people not to try to kill  snakes
because it’s dangerous,” said Mdluli. One of the pupils said they
are grateful that the snake has been removed after it terrified them while they
were busy learning. “We don’t know how it entered
the classroom. We just saw it on the corner of the ceiling. We didn’t know that
we have black mambas in the area,” said the pupil.
