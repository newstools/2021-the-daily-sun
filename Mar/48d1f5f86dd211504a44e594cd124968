KAIZER CHIEFS coach Gavin Hunt is hoping to have Khama Billiat, Leonardo Castro and Ramahlwe “Rama” Mphahlele back when his side host Moroccan side, Wydad Athletic in their Caf Champions League Group C match at FNB Stadium on 3 April. The trio missed the 1-0 Soweto derby victory over Orlando Pirates at FNB Stadium on Sunday. Billiat suffered a leg fracture against Maritzburg United in January and has missed the last 15 games in all competitions. Castro has missed the last four after suffering an injury against Wydad in the match that was played late last month in a neutral venue in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Mphahlele, the Chiefs captain, is struggling with a hamstring injury. Rama was sent off in the first match against Wydad which Amakhosi lost 4-0, but would be available should he be fit next month. Hunt was also without Kearyn Baccus (injured), Lebohang Manyama (suspended) and Itumeleng Khune (compassionate leave) against Pirates. Khune, who lost his sister recently, will be available and is currently in the Bafana Bafana camp. “If I can get Billiat, Castro back and Rama back, we’ll have a few numbers in,” said Hunt. “Baccus wasn’t available against Pirates and that didn’t help us.” Hunt’s men are third in Group C with five points after four games, tied with Horoya of Guinea who have a better goal difference and must beat Wydad if they hope to progress. The coach has welcomed the Fifa international break, saying his players needed a “mental break” to clear their minds. He said those who are left behind will get time off. “Our players need a mental break, not a physical break,” said Hunt. “There’s a couple that are not going to train, there are some that will train. We also have to get ones that are not fit to be fitter. There are seven or eight players who need a complete break. “We’ll give them a few days off, to recharge and we go again for the last push.”
