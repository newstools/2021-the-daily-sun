LADY of Soul, as Portia Luthuli (39) is affectionately known on Ligwalagwala FM, is on a road to teach forgiveness. Portia said forgiveness can set many free. “We cannot change the past but we can work on the present and future. I am a spirit-led presenter who preaches the gospel of Jesus Christ to teach the community at large.” The host of Siyadvumisa, which airs every Sunday from 7am to 9am said her show is about praise and worship. “I play mainly gospel complimented by Sunday school teachings and motivational talks.” Portia said her most popular feature is Litsini-Livi, what does the Bible say. “I explain the meaning of scriptures. Some people do not understand the meaning and end up misinterpreting them. “Once they understand, they will be able to apply them on their daily lives.” ALSO READ | ZAHARA'S SISTER DIES IN A TRAGIC CAR CRASH She also hosts formal education slots at the station Monday to Thursday between 9pm and 10pm. “I speak about health issues, financial literacy, civic education, science and technology.” Every Sunday after Siyadvumisa, Portia leads a congregation at Jesus Our Salvation International Ministry, where she became the pastor in 1998. “I saw a vision during my studies in Joburg. I saw four corners of the earth and four scrolls. I heard a big voice that changed to softer calling my name. “It said I am the God of Abraham, Jacob and Isaac. I want you to go and tell people to be born again,” she said. Portia accepted the calling even though she did not understand it. “I told the late pastor Makwakwa, who explained he also had a divine visitation from God that he must support and guide me through the calling. Portia also runs organisations Deborah’s Women Club, Lavish Publishing and Lavish Hair products in Kanyamazane, Mbombela.
