FORMER Eskom senior manager France Hlakudi, who is charged with fraud and tax offences amounting to more than R30 million, appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court yesterday. But the matter was postponed to 22 April by Magistrate Adriaan Bekker, to allow time to hand down judgment on the application brought by the defence for the striking off the roll of the charges. According to the Investigate Directorate spokeswoman, Sindisiwe Twala, Hlakudi’s team argued the fraud charges should not be applicable in this matter and should be struck off before the matter proceeds to trial. R40K BET ENDS IN TEARS! Twala said Hlakudi intentionally defrauded Sars by failing to disclose his true income, which amounts to an intent to defraud the state.
