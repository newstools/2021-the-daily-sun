SPORTS minister, Nathi Mthethwa, has credited Patrice Motsepe's success, as CAF president, to the unity within South African football, led by PSL chairman Irvin Khoza and Danny Jordaan, the Safa boss. Mthethwa was among the leaders that welcomed Motsepe back home in South Africa where he addressed the media at the Convention Centre in Sandton on Tuesday. "Thank you precisely," said Mthethwa to Khoza and Jordaan. He said Motsepe was an easy candidate to sell in Africa. "It's the new beginning for CAF," said Mthethwa. "We want Caf that will be in the news for all the right reasons. We've said we wanted ethical leadership and that will happen, under Motsepe. "We wanted to see CAF that moves to self sufficiency. The development of football on the continent. And less chasing money but chasing development. We are certain we will get it." The African Union (AU) themed 2021 as the year of arts, culture and heritage. The heritage has to be respected and felt by everybody else. "To Presidents across the 54 countries (in Africa), this is your candidate. You're his President and you'll help him and support him to take CAF to higher places."Â He warned Motsepe that it won't be easy, "but you're equal to the task". Motsepe said the best ideas don't come from him but that of the people he has surrounded himself with. "This is not from the brilliant manifesto that we produced, we need more," said Motsepe. "I cannot be the President of CAF when Bafana Bafana are not doing well. We have to succeed. Every single countries in Africa has to succeed and grow. The one better person in African who has done in negotiating TV rights in South Africa is Irvin Khoza and Kaizer Motaung. I will be taking guidance from them."
