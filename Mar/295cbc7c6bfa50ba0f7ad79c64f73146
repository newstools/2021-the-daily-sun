ALL charges against Norma Mngoma have been provisionally withdrawn. The estranged wife of former minister Malusi Gigaba appeared at the Tshwane Magistrates Court on Friday, 26 March. She was arrested last July on charges of malicious damage to property and crimen injuria relating to the damage of a luxury SUV that apparently belonged to her husband’s friend. She was released on R5 000 bail before the charges were withdrawn. The National Prosecuting Authority said the case is provisionally withdrawn and a decision on whether to reinstate the matter will depend on the consideration of further representation by Mr Gigaba. This comes a month after the North Gauteng High Court ruled that Gigaba abused his powers by involving the Hawks in a domestic dispute. Speaking to the media outside the court, Mngoma, said it has been an emotional time for her and her children. “Whoever opened the case is the one who fabricated this whole thing, but the truth will come up,” she said. She further alleged that Gigaba was friends with the Hawks and that they just wanted to silence her.
