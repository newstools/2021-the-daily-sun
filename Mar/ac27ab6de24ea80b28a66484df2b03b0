FORMER Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns winger George Lebese have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The 32-year-old Mamelodi-born player has been forced to terminate his contract with USL Championship outfit Colorado Springs Switchbacks due to Covid-19 traveling regulations in the US. Lebese joined the USL Championship outfit in 2019 on a free transfer after parting ways with Mamelodi Sundowns. The player broke the news on his Twitter account on Saturday in a brief statement which said: "It is with a heavy heart that I have to terminate my contract with the Switchbacks. "This pandemic has consumed and taken away from many people, and now I am a living force of that. Due to the decision, the president of the US made on 26th Jan to close boarders for South Africa with NO EXCEPTION!!!. "I am not able to travel and fulfil my contract with the team after patiently waiting to see if it opens, two months are passing with no upliftment and the club are proposing a termination to minimize risk from both ends. "I thank @Switchbacks for the opportunity to be part of the team. This was honestly not an easy but a heartfelt decision. As of with immediate effect I am a free agent and looking forward to what is next for my career. "Lebese, signed one one-year deal with the SwitchbacksÂ  on his arrival. It came to an end at the end of last season, and it was renewed in November, he was supposed to re-join his teammates early February.
