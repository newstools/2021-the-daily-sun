MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach, Rhulani Mokwena, has warned against complacency when the defending Ke Yona champions face GladAfrica Championship side Polokwane City in the last-16 of the Nedbank Cup this afternoon at Loftus Versfeld Stadium (3pm). The winner will go through to the quarter-finals, where they will face Soweto giants Orlando Pirates. Mokwena is not taking Rise and Shine lightly as they already have an idea of players who might be troublesome. Mokwena stated: “We are playing a very big game. We cannot over emphasise this game’s magnitude against a rejuvenated side that has a new coach. “If you look at their last four results, it is two wins and two draws. We will have to work hard to score. They have good defenders in (Nicholas) Motloung, (Njabulo) Buthelezi and (Dillon) Goss. “They build up well from the back, and they’re supremely comfortable on the ball. In the midfield, they have Danny Phiri to consolidate and give them possibilities to deal with second balls. Upfront they have Charlton Mashumba, (Lesiba) Nku and Puleng Tlolane is still there.” Sundowns’ star-studded team heads into this encounter after a historic weekend, where they became the first club to beat DR Congo giants TP Mazembe at their home ground in Lubumbashi during a Caf Champions League group match. Mokwena said they had set high demands, and they will have to maintain those standards and will not be taking anything for granted against their lower league opponents today. He said: “We don’t deal with complacency. We don’t allow it to creep in. “We have extremely high demands with high goals and targets that we have set for ourselves, and that should speak to our mental state as to how we approach our game.” In the last five meetings between these two sides, Sundowns have won three, drawn once and lost once.
