A California woman who markets sexy snaps and videos online found herself in hot water. Her online activities led a Catholic school to kick out her three kids. Mrs Poindexter on OnlyFans claims to make more than R2 million a month selling access to naughty photos and videos. But her seductive venture has landed her in hot water at her kids’ Sacred Heart Parish School in Sacramento, which she said has expelled them. According to The New York Post, the principal said the family was no longer welcome at the school and even banned them from picking up the children’s belongings. Poindexter said a group of mothers discovered her site last summer and started a campaign to get her kids kicked out of the school. At one point, the group reportedly sent anonymous envelopes including her explicit material to the principal. “They wanted my kids removed who are innocent to this whole thing,” Poindexter said.
