VELI Mothwa’s Bafana Bafana call-up doesn’t mean that he has arrived, but it is a source of motivation, according to the AmaZulu goalkeeper. Mothwa was called up for the Bafana squad that will face Ghana at FNB Stadium in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier on Thursday evening (6pm) and also against Sudan in Khartoum on Sunday. Mothwa will vie for a place in the starting line-up with 91-capped Itumeleng Khune and Ronwen Williams who has 16 caps. The uncapped Mothwa says he deserves this call-up as he has been one of the outstanding players in the Usuthu side that has won four league games on the trot for the first since 2009. In 17 DStv Premiership matches, Mothwa has kept five clean sheets. “I’m personally an open person. When something happens, I ask and I want people to tell me what is happening, where I’m going, where I am,” said Mothwa. “I’m not that kind of person to say, yeah, I have made it so what? Whoever is going to tell me this I’m not going to listen.” The 30-year-old has dethroned Siyabonga Mbatha and is now Usuthu’s number one keeper. Since coach Benni McCarthy took over as AmaZulu coach in December, Mothwa, in 13 league games under the former Bafana striker, has only missed two games. To be where he is now, Mothwa has credited McCarthy, who advised him to do the same thing he has been doing at his club when he trains with Bafana. “What coach said to me was ‘don’t change what you are doing here when you get there. Work the way you are working here. It is the national team but don’t show them that you are happy to be there. Show them that you are there to work, not to be there to add up the numbers’,” said Mothwa who joined Usuthu from Chippa last year on a two-year deal. “I want to achieve more than what I have achieved up to now. The coach has kept on saying, ‘work hard and you’ll be okay in future’.”
