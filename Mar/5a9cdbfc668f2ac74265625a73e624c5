When some people discuss business ideas others gossip about people who’re trying to improve their lives. Unless you’re an investigative journalist, gossip will never bring you an income. If you want to progress in life, you ought to socialise with people whose conversations are dominated by self-development. Talking bad about people will never benefit you. Rather use your energy to start small businesses, for which there are gaps. We should be happy to see our neighbours succeeding. If anything, we’re the ones who should support them. If they succeed surely they’ll hire locals. We can also learn new tricks from them. Even if we don’t sell the same product, we can still learn business strategy. Job or business opportunities pass you by when you discuss other people. Stop discussing people – discuss ideas. Ga-Manthata
