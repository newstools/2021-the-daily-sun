AWARD-WINNING kelorap artist, Biodizzy is holding on to music even though it isn’t going as he had hoped. The 24-year-old, whose real name is Khuthatso Moyaba, said breaking into the industry has been hard but he won’t give up. Biodizzy does the new and rising genre, which is rap in Khelobedu. He told SunBuzz he’s starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel because of the artists he’s worked with so far. Biodizzy said: “Although it has been a bit more difficult for me to break into the music industry and also be recognised as an artist, I’ve remained true to my calling. “I’ve worked with artists such as Makhadzi, Double Trouble, Prince Benza, Mr Brown and Percy Mukwevho. “That gives me hope and I believe it’ll happen for me soon,” he said. The rapper, who won a Limpopo Music Award for best Hip-Hop single in 2018, started pursuing his career in 2017. “I officially started making music in 2013 but I didn’t release any of the songs I made. This was because I didn’t know how the music industry worked. “Luckily in 2017 I was signed and that opened a lot of doors for me. I learnt a lot. “Little didn’t I know I’d win an award a year later,” he said.
