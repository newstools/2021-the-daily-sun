SWALLOWS FC striker Ruzaigh Gamildien is looking to surpass the
15-goal mark in the DStv Premiership. The 31-year-old has so far scored ten goals in 16 games and
looks well within reach of his target. Only three players have managed to get more than 15 goals in the
last decade. Mwape Musonda scored 16 goals for Black Leopards two seasons
ago. Last season, Peter Shalulile and Gabadinho Mhango also scored 16
goals each player to share the golden boot. But Gamildien is looking to go beyond that in the last 13 games. "I set myself a realistic target of 15 goals and I am five
goals shy of that," he said. "I am trying to pass that 15 goals mark in the PSL. But
things are going to be very difficult because teams are starting to study our
movements." Gamildien's impressive displays saw him being named in the
26-men Bafana Bafana squad for this month's back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations
qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan for the first time since 2013. The player is looking forward to getting a chance to help the
national team. He said: "Definitely if you are being called up in the
national team your job is to perform to your very best and make a difference,
score and help the team win.” Gamildien will be hoping to add to hiss tally on Sunday afternoon when Swallows host Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at Dobsonville Stadium (3:30pm).
