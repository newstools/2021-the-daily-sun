A man who
allegedly posed as a police officer and committed a robbery in Durban has been
arrested. On Monday,
police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said officers were patrolling Warwick
Avenue around midday on Sunday, when they were approached by a man who told
them that two unknown suspects had robbed him. "It
was alleged that one of the men posed as a police officer. The victim was
searched and robbed of his belongings by the two men. "The
police officers conducted a follow-up operation, which led them to the Phoenix
taxi rank in the CBD, where one of the suspects was positively identified by
the victim. A 35-year-old man was searched and was found in possession of the
complainant's cellphone and cash," Gwala said. She added
that the man was also found in possession of a fake police appointment card
that was allegedly used during the commission of the crime. "He
was placed under arrest for charges of robbery and impersonating a police
officer. The man is
expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court later on Monday. SOURCE:
