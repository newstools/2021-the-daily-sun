GAUTENG has a backlog of thousands of DNA and ballistic reports while families continue to seek justice. This is according to a statement released by the DA on Thursday, 24 March. DA’s Gauteng Shadow MEC for Community Safety Michael Shackleton said it was revealed at the Gauteng Provincial Legislature that there was a backlog of 113 285 DNA and 9 757 ballistic reports in the province. He said the information was given during an oral reply by Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Faith Mazibuko. Shackleton said Mazibuko told the legislature the backlogs were as a result of shortage of consumables. “Although Mazibuko stated that she has no idea as to when this backlog would be cleared and how many cases are held up as a result, she did indicate that such a question should rather be redirected to the National Prosecuting Authority,” he said. Shackleton further described Mazibuko as arrogant. He said when asked further questions, she responded by saying: “We will let you know when we let you know.” Shackleton said: “Mazibuko clearly has little compassion for the victims whose right to justice is delayed as a result of these backlogs. With a DNA and ballistic report backlog of this proportion, there will be a delay in prosecutions, possibly leading to cases being struck off the roll due to no evidence produced in court.” Shackleton urged the MEC to work with families of the victims. “Instead of giving heartless responses to pertinent questions in the legislature, the MEC must get off her high horse and start working to bring justice to the victims. Justice delayed is justice denied,” he added. Mazibuko’s spokeswoman Pinkie Numa confirmed that indeed she shared the figures with the legislature and referred Daily Sun to the SAPS for further inquiries.
