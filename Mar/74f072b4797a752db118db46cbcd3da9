PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to appear before the Zondo Commission on 22 April. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo determined the dates on Wednesday. He said the president’s evidence would take four days, including 23, 28 and 29 April. “The dates 22 and 23 are effectively provided for the ruling party because I’ve indicated this commission cannot complete its work without the ANC coming to give evidence and deal with certain matters,” said Zondo. He said he understood Ramaphosa would testify representing the ANC on those dates. However, on 28 and 29, he would be testifying in his capacity as the president. “I thought I should just make that announcement so the public is aware,” said Zondo. The commission is continuing to hear evidence related to SARS from former Bain partner, Athol Williams.
