MOLEFI Ntseki has owned up to Bafana Bafana failure to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) following their 2-0 defeat to Sudan in Khartoum on Sunday. They finished the Group C perking order third on the log with 10 while Ghana won the group with 13 points, followed by Sudan with 12. Ntseki admitted that the failure has dented South Africa's image and possibility of improving on Fifa rankings. "The disappointment goes to every South African... the emotional pain that we have caused South Africans," said Ntseki following their loss. "As a head coach of Bafana Bafana I came up with a turn around strategy, and I think everything started very well because we managed to accumulate the 10 points. We just needed a point to qualify. Yes as a coach, head of the selection committee, as head of the team my disappointment is huge. "It's very huge for my personal growth, my personal achievements as coach of Bafana because the success of the team is my success. "The failure of the team firstly starts with me to say I have failed as a coach because in football we need to own up. When there's success then you become everybody's favourite, but when there's failure you become an orphan and everybody is looking up to you and say you failed the team, you could not qualify. "But things like these do happen in football. And we own up, we need to be very strong and say the team did not qualify. As a South African I wanted to see South Africa qualify. It's a big disappointment from my side."
