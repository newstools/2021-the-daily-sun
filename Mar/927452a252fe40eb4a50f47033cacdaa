Gauteng Traffic cops arrested fifteen male drunk drivers on
Friday during an operation conducted in Eldorado Park, Joburg. Gauteng Traffic Police spokesperson Sello Maremane, said the
suspects range between the ages of 20 and 40 years. "The highest drunk driver recorded 0.98 mg/1000 ml
which is almost 3 times over the legal limit of 0.24mg/1000 ml. “This kind of behavior is highly regrettable and will not be
tolerated as it undermines our efforts to promote road safety. We call upon
drivers to be responsible and resist the temptation of drinking and driving on
our roads especially since we approach the Easter season period,” he in a
statement. Maremane said majority of road accidents were as a result of
road user behavior which includes driving under the influence of alcohol. "The consequences are dire for young people since they
will acquire a criminal record denting their chances of employment especially
within the public sector,’’ he added. Maremane said the suspects were detained in Eldorado Park
police station and are expected to appear in Kliptown Magistrates Court on
Monday to face charges of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
