IT may not be affordable right now, but with planning, setting goals and a willingness to wait and save, you’ll get there. Before starting your budget, consider these factors:1. Where you go Some countries are expensive to visit and you’ll pay more if you want to travel between countries on one holiday.2. How long you stay The fixed costs to get there are expensive, so aim for a minimum of two weeks or, if you can afford it, longer.3. Travelling alone or with a partner It’s expensive to travel alone, unless you have friends to visit. Travelling with a partner is safer and costs may be shared.4. Type of accommodation There are expensive five-star hotel options, and shared hostel options that vary in price.5. When you travel Certain times of the year are peak season and more expensive. There are also fixed costs, which you have to pay regardless of how long you plan to go:- passports and visas- airfare, baggage fees and airport taxes- immunisations and travel insurance- accommodation, and food and drink. Enjoy every moment of the planning process and enjoy seeing your savings grow.
