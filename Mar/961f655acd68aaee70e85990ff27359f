A 64-YEAR-OLD madala was saved by farm security guards after he was found with eight slaughtered cattle at eMakhuzeni reserve outside Highflats, south of KZN. He and other suspects were bust by residents while skinning the cattle in the early hours of Wednesday, 31 March. Bongakonke Radebe (50), owner of the slaughtered cattle, told Daily Sun he and neighbours were woken up by the sound of pangas. He said they went towards the direction of the panga sounds and found about five men skinning his cattle. “When they saw us they ran into the three vans that were parked nearby, but farm security guards managed to block one vehicle and arrested one suspect,” said Bongakonke. He said the suspect confessed he was a scholar transport driver sent by a man who lives at Seventeen Men’s Hostel in Umlazi, south of Durban. Bongakonke said there’s a syndicate working with various butchery and shisa nyama owners in Umlazi. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police arrested a 64-year-old suspect found in possession of eight slaughtered cattle at the scene. She said the suspect’s van was burnt by residents and other suspects fled the scene. The suspect was expected to appear in the Highflats Magistrates Court on Thursday, 1 April in connection with stock theft.
