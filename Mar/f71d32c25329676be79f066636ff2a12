Considering the above, the mandate from the producers was very clear to me – to find balance in casting experienced actors and also young new/fresh talent.” According to the SABC, uBettina Wethu is a milestone for the channel as it makes history for the platform by scheduling an international programme of this calibre. uBettina Wethu will air Monday to Wednesday at 7.30pm from April.
