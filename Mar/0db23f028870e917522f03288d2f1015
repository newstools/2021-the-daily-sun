ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer reached the highest milestone of the club on Wednesday. Pirates beat Nigerian side Enyimba FC 2-1 in the Caf Confederation Cup group stages match at Orlando Stadium. In beating Enyimba, the Germany-born coach made history in the side that even guys like Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic could not achieve. Even former Dutch star, Rudi Krol, who won the first treble in 2010-11 season, and Julio Leal who won the MTN8 and TKO in the second season then to add another treble, are falling behind Zinnbauer in terms of winning percentage. This was Zinnbuer’s 50th game in charge of Orlando Pirates since he assumed the role in December 2019. Since he arrived, winning in his first game against Black Leopards at Orlando Stadium, Pirates have won 30 games. The German's 60% win rate is the highest for a Pirates coach in their opening 50 games for the club in the PSL era. In the process, Pirates have drawn 14, lost six games. In these games, Zinnbauer delivered a MTN8 trophy to end the Bucs’six-year wait in December last year when they beat Bloemfontein Celtic in the final in Durban. However, the former Hamburg coach said he can’t take the credit alone. “This is not alone work. Yes, I’m happy about this result and I saw the stats and it is very good,” said Zinnbauer. “Such things make you hungry but we have to go forward. I want to say thank you to the players because they are the first in this because they follow us as coaches and win the points for us. “Another thing, we work together. We work for us, we work for the results and I’m happy about this. I have to say thank you to these guys and because it is not my work alone.” Best Win Percentage: Julio Leal 58% (18 wins / 7 defeats / 6 draws) Ruud Krol 51% (60 wins / 21 defeats / 37 draws) Micho Sredojevic 50% (25 wins / 10 defeats/ 15 draws) Bibey Mutombo 48% (13 wins / 7 defeats / 7 draws) Vladimir Vermezovic 47% (20 wins / 12 defeats / 10 draws) Owen da Gama 39% (11 wins / 9 defeats / 8 draws) Muhsin Ertugral 33% (3 wins / 2 defeats / 4 draws) Kjell Jonevret 32% (6 wins / 5 defeats / 8 draws) Roger De Sa 48% (31 wins / 14 defeats / 20 draws) Eric Tinkler 48% (36 wins / 20 defeats / 19 draws) Augusto Palacios 47% (9 wins / 4 defeats/ 6 draws) Most Games: Ruud Krol 108, Eric Tinkler 75, Roger De Sa 65, Micho Sredojevic 50, Vladimir Vermezovic 42, Julio Leal 31, Owen da Gama 28, Bibey Mutombo 27, Augusto Palacios 19, Kjell Jonevret 19, Muhsin Ertugral nine.
