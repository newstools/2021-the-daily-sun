CRICKET South Africa (CSA) has announced the return of the 'Pink Day,' which will take place at the Wanderers on the 4th April (10am). The event‚ which is in its 10th-year ‚ is aimed at raising funds for breast cancer research, and Charlotte Maxeke Hospital will once again be the beneficiary. CSA confirmed that due to Covid-19 protocols, this year's Pink Day ODI would be played behind closed doors. "That will in no way be allowed to detract from the over-riding purpose of the game. Fans can still get involved and support the spirit of what Pink Day is all about," read CSA's statement. This will be Pakistan's second time participating in the Pink Day, their last encounter coming in 2013 when Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers shared a then-ODI record stand of 238 off 182 balls. "As we all know breast cancer is a scourge that has a high impact on family life which is at the core of every community. It affects all of us," commented CSA Acting Chief Executive Pholetsi Moseki. "We are proud of our efforts over the years in raising awareness and mobilising cricket fans through the Pledge Pink campaign. It is one of our foremost social programmes and proves how sport can play a broader role in society. "Sport can unify people like nothing else, and it has been wonderful to see the support we have received every year for this big day from the various countries that have played against our Proteas in this match. "It is this international brotherhood that helps to make the occasion so special and successful. I would like to extend a special vote of thanks to the Pakistan Cricket Board, their officials and players."
