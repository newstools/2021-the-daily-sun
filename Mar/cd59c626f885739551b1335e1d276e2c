A JOINT operation led by Mpumalanga Community Safety MEC Vusi Shongwe yielded positive results on Friday night when several people were arrested during the Overall Friday Operation in Ermelo. The operation saw law enforcement coming together to patrol the area, visiting liquor outlets and taverns in the area to ensure compliance while enhancing law enforcement, which is also critical to crime prevention. At least 14 taverns were raided and crime hot spots in the area were visited.  Several people were arrested for murder, attempted murder, illegal possession of firearms, dangerous weapons, possession of dagga, contravention of the Distaster Management Act and contravention of the Immigration Act. Ermelo has been identified as one of the areas with challenges of gangs fuelled by some individuals in the business community with nefarious intentions of destabilising their competitors. Shongwe said: “Police must service crime because our communities deserve to live in peace. The police must be respected by all because they are prime protectors of communities,” he said. He called on the police to tirelessly work around the clock to bring wanted suspects to book. He warned the police not to be friendly with criminals because if they are associated with shady characters, they will not be respected in their communities.
