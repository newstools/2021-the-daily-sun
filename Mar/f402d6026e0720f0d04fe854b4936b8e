SOUTH Africa Football Association (Safa) CEO Tebogo Motlanthe says the Under-17 Africa Cup of Nations annulment is a massive setback for the aspiring youngsters. The continental tournament was scheduled to take place from 13 until 31 March in Morocco. However, it has been cancelled following a decision by the Caf emergency committee meeting. SA Under-20 side coached by Vela Khumalo, had struggled to get their visas to Morocco in time. Motlanthe said as much it is a setback, the situation was beyond everyone's control. "We had a struggle about the Visa'sand it was informed mainly by the Covid-19 status of Morocco," Motlanthe revealed on Tuesday. "We were in contact with Caf throughout; yesterday (Monday), we received a call. I spoke to the general secretary of Caf (Abdelmouna√Øm Bah), who said to me there would be having an emergency committee meeting at 9 pm last night." He continued: "They had the meeting, and immediately after the meeting, our president (Safa president Danny Jordan) informed me that the tournament had been cancelled because clubs which are already there (in Morocco) have detected some covid-19 cases in most of them. "Look, of course, it's a setback because you wanted to test our under-17 against the continental powerhouse, but it is not the end of the road for the players. "We would like to see them graduating to Under-20. We see future Bafana Bafana in them, for them now is to go back and focus I their academic life. It's a setback, but we have to live with it. It is beyond all of us." In the meeting, Motlanthe said they did consider postponing the game, but that would not help in any way as most of the players would not qualify. He stated: "Of course, the postponement will results in most of these players not qualifying, and they also considered the fact that Fifa has canceled the Under-17 Fifa World Cup, so the only solution they could come up with was to call off the tournament."
