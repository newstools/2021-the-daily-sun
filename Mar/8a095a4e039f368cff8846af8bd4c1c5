THE NPA is considering Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s request that perjury charges against her be withdrawn. And with that placed on record, the Pretoria Magistrates Court postponed the matter to 25 June to give the NPA more time to consider the request. The postponement was on the request of the NPA asking for more time. Mkhwebane made a brief appearance in court on Thursday, when the matter was postponed. She’d previously threatened to approach the High Court to have the matter struck out. Mkhwebane was charged with perjury after the NPA said she allegedly lied under oath in November 2017 and April 2018 about the number of meetings she had with former president Jacob Zuma. The NPA charged that she made the declaration knowing it was false.
