RETHABILE Mosuhli loves shoes, and she especially likes high heels. Rethabile was born with dwarfism and wears size 12 kiddies shoes that are ever so cute. “But I don’t want cute shoes,” said Rethabile. “I desire beautiful high-heeled shoes.” Rethabile (31) from Vereeniging, south of Joburg, said her feet are small and she has no choice but to buy children’s shoes. She said when she was a teenager, her mum took her to a factory in Lesotho once a year where high heels were custom made for her. “It was like heaven. They measured my feet and I chose from different designs. “I couldn’t wait to come back to Jozi and walk the streets in them. The heels made me confident. “I told myself that once I started working, I’d go to the factory every three months. “When people asked where I got my shoes I loved telling them they were designer shoes.” When she started working she took her first salary check, got on a taxi and went back to the factory – but it was gone. “I heard the factory had moved. I spent the whole weekend looking for the workers to find out what had happened, but I found nobody,” she said. “I’m working and I can buy many shoes, but I can’t get any. It hurts to see a nice pair of heels while shopping but they’re never in my size.” She doesn’t like wearing children’s shoes. “It makes me angry when people say how cute my shoes are,” she said. “I just buy shoes because I can’t walk barefoot.” She said her wish is to find a designer who can custom make shoes for her. “I want to motivate people who’re born differently abled,” she said. “But I don’t see myself walking to the podium in Barbie shoes. “I like shoes and talking about them. “I’m desperate for real shoes. “They’ll bring back my confidence.”
