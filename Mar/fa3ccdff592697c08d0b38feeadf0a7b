TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula has issued an apology for his tweet about Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. He said he made a comment about a dinner hosted by former president Jacob Zuma with candidates who were contesting the ANC presidency, and this appeared to have been construed as an attack on Dlamini-Zuma. In the tweet on Monday, 8 March, Mbalula claimed Dlamini-Zuma’s ex-husband, Zuma, wanted to create a family dynasty. He said: “It is regretful and unfortunate that my comment may have come across as an attack on the person and integrity of Cde Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, as this was never the intention.” Mbalula said he unreservedly apologises to Dlamini-Zuma and wished to assure her that he will keep her name out of any political battles and commentary. The minister has also made it clear, with regards to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, that he stands by his words. This comes after she opened a case of crimen injuria against him for a tweet that he made. Mbalula said having noted the threat by Mkhwebane to take him to court over his references to her, he wishes to reiterate that he stands by his views. He said she has conducted herself as a hired gun and more interested in pursuing partisan political agendas rather than upholding the stature of the office of the Public Protector, with the responsibility to place the interests of citizens first. “I therefore remain ready to meet her in court to defend my statement,” said Mbalula.
