CHIPPA United are eager to end their four game winless run at the expense of high riding AmaZulu. The teams will battle it out in a DStv Premiership match at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane near East London On Wednesday (5pm). The Chilli Boys are still reeling from a heavy 3-0 defeat to the Soweto giants Orlando Pirates in their backyard over the weekend. The defeat has pushed the Dan Malesela’s side deeper into the relegation quagmire. In fact, the Gqeberha-based outfit last tasted victory on 23 January when they hammered bottom side Black Leopards 3-0 at Thohoyandou Stadium. Chippa are now sitting in 13th position on the log table, tied with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) on 16 points from 18 matches. They are four points ahead of Leopards and three above second bottom Maritzburg United. Chilli Boys midfielder Maloisane Mokhele said they have made their homework thoroughly on Usuthu, and are not prepared to falter again. AmaZulu are unbeaten in their past six league matches, which saw their coach Benni McCarthy being crowned the DStv Premiership Coach of the Month for January and February. Said Mokhele: “Our remedy is to keep ball possession to tire our opponents. They will then make mistakes and we will capitalise on them to win the game. “We’ve learnt our lessons from the Pirates defeat and mistakes happen in football. But how we react going forward matters most.” The 24-year-old player said their failure to utilise chances they create has been their main downfall. AmaZulu will rely on the scoring prowess of the likes of Lehlohonolo Majoro and Siphelele Mthembu, while the Chilli Boys will pin their hopes on Augustine Kwem and Bienvenu Eva Nga.
