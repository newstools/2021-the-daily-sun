The SABC will not be broadcasting the Bafana Bafana v Sudan Afcon qualifier live on Sunday at 6pm "due to the exorbitant costs, and as a result this match will not be aired on any of the SABC platforms". Acting SABC spokesperson, Mmoni Seapolelo, confirmed that the game will not be televised live on either of the broadcasters' platforms, including radio. In a statement, the SABC said: "The SABC can confirm that the public service broadcaster couldn't obtain the broadcasting rights of the match between Bafana and Sudan, as a result this match will not be aired on any of the platforms." The all-important final Group C qualifier, scheduled for the Khartoum Independent Stadium, was originally scheduled to be broadcast by the SABC, but rights complications, forced a complete blackout of the match. SunSport understands that the game has been taken off the schedule and we will no longer be broadcast due to rights.
