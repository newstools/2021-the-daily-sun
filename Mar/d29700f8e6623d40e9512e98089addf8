MZANSI recently moved to level one after the deadly Covid-19 second wave. But there are already fears of a third wave. And this was caused by large gatherings, especially at Tshwane pubs. A video made the rounds on social media of DJ Lamiez Holworthy playing at an overly packed pub in Soshanguve on Saturday, 13 March. Patrons could be seen having fun and contravening all lockdown regulations. It even looked like the DJ and what looked like bouncers were not wearing masks, or even maintaining social distancing.  The video was initially posted with the caption that Lamiez’s phone was snatched at the venue. But social media users were more worried about the spread of Covid-19. Sihle Nduna said: “Covid will rise again. No social distancing.” Lamiez’s manager, Imelda Klow, who’s also her mother, told Daily Sun she’d only be able to speak to her next week as she was resting. She said she had to cancel all her shoots and gigs for this week. “I’m very protective over my child, so she will be able to respond to your questions next week,” she said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo condemned the actions of those who choose to ignore regulations. “If police find you not wearing a mask, they will first warn you before arresting you,” he said. He also urged people to report those not adhering to lockdown regulations.
