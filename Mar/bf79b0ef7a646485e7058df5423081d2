Lara Goodall’s career-best half-century helped the Momentum Proteas complete their highest successful one-day international chase as they beat India Women by seven wickets to surge into an unassailable 3-1 lead at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on Sunday. Set a target of 267, the in-form Lizelle Lee struck 69 (75 balls, 10 fours), stand-in captain Laura Wolvaardt hit 53 (78 balls, six fours), Player of the Match Mignon du Preez attacked with 61 off 55 balls (eight fours, one six) and the solid Goodall made an unbeaten 59 off 66 balls (five fours) as South Africa won with eight balls to spare.Their chase beat their previous highest effort of 265 against England at Centurion in 2015-16 and also secured a third successive series triumph after they beat New Zealand (2020) and Pakistan (2021) in their previous two 50-over outings.In between those fixtures, coach Hilton Moreeng’s charges also reached the T20 World Cup semifinal in Australia last year, an indication that they are a team making substantial gains in the world game.They had been impressive in their two wins so far on their tour to India, which is taking place in a bio-secure environment (BSE) in Lucknow, with their latest result meaning they have secured the series with a game to spare.But they will go into that game on Wednesday full of confidence following Sunday’s assured win, built around the batsmen.The bowlers had earlier conceded 266 for four after Wolvaardt, again standing in as captain for the injured Sune Luus, won the toss and opted to field first.India's innings was built around Punam Raut’s third career century after she top-scored with an unbeaten 104 (123 balls, 10 fours).Harmanpreet Kaur also plundered 54 off 35 balls (seven fours, one six), while there were useful contributions from skipper Mithali Raj (45) and Priya Punia (32).For the South Africans, Nondumiso Shangase (1-41) was most impressive, along with Ayabonga Khaka (0-26). Shabnim Ismail (1-50) also claimed a wicket, while the most successful bowler was Tumi Sekhukhune with 2-63.With a huge target in front of them, the Proteas set out towards the task with an impressive Lee-Wolvaardt stand that yielded 116. The two set the tone from the outset by scoring 79 in the first 15 overs and that allowed for their side to stay ahead of the chase.After both fell in quick succession, the baton was taken up boldly by Du Preez and Goodall. The two added 103 for the third wicket to drain the Indian bowlers and continue the momentum in favour of the tourists.Du Preez was removed with 31 runs still needed, but Marizanne Kapp stepped in and blasted 22 off 18 balls to help Goodall complete the job. -SuperSport
