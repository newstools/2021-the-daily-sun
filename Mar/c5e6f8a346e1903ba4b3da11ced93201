KAIZER Chiefs and Moroka Swallows legend prolific midfield goal scorer, Malefetsane "Chippa" Molatedi is appealing to parents to support their kids in sport. This even if it means they must go to the ground to support their children He spends the better part of his daily afternoons at the dusty streets of Phiri, Soweto where he has committed to drilling in skills to 35 aspiring footballers - grouped in Under-9, U-11, U-13, U-15 and U-17. If not at the Phiri park which is next to the community hall, Molatedi, also known Fetsi, has cut an agreement with Seana Marena High School with regards to using their soccer grounds in Mapetla. But the 60-year-old Molatedi, who led Chiefs to a historic Mainstay Cup final by scoring a brace in their semi-final clash against African Wanderers, where he came on as a substitute in the second half where Amakhosi were trailing 1-0 at Ellis Park, then he punched in two for the Naturena side to win it 3-1, has a vision of starting a professional football academy. "Seana Marena High School were generous by offering me the soccer grounds to use, and I also volunteered to helping their soccer team when they need my assistance," said the legend. "My team is financially well supported. All kids are freely allowed to come and train with us to keep them out of crime infested street, and drugs. Those more talented might play professional soccer. But my biggest request is that parents must support their children, academically and sports-wise."  As a sign that this initiative is bearing fruits, Molatedi has one player that he prides himself with: 17-year-old Kabelo Molatedi, son of Tshepo Molatedi who is now training with Chiefs' development structures. "I'm so serious about this, and I applaud all those who are doing the same thing as I'm doing," he asked. "Most academies are in town and these children in townships don't have fare money to attend to them. I want something that will be in a walking distance, in the township and free for all."
