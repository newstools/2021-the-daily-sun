FORMER eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede is expected to appear in the Durban Magistrates Court today. Gumede and 21 co-accused are facing corruption charges relating to a waste collection tender amounting to over R430 million. The tender was issued by the municipality in 2017. Following arguments between the state and lawyers of the accused in 2020, the matter was postponed to 23 March. Magistrate Dawn Somaroo said previously that prosecutor Ashiken Lucken should ensure the forensic report was ready. The report has exhibits that will be used in the trial. Gumedeâ€™s supporters have arrived outside court and are chanting struggle songs.
