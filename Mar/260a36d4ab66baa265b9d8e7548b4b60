PITSO Mosimane once bragged that Mamelodi Sundowns only sell players to overseas clubs. Well, the former Downs coach’s statement certainly rings true with Siphelele Mkhulise being the latest player to attract interest from the European side Monaco, France. The enterprising midfielder is being monitored by scouts from the French Ligue 1, who wants to invite him for trials, according to French reports. Mkhulise could follow in the footsteps of Lyle Foster, the former Orlando Pirates striker who was snapped up by The Monegasques three years ago, although the youngster could not stick it out. Mkhulise is currently on a five-year contract, which expires the season after next. He is a regular in the team, having played 15 games for Masandawana so far this season. Should he move overseas, he will be the fifth local player to be exported to France in a decade, joining Lebo Mothiba, Keagan Dolly, Lebogang Phiri and Bongani Zungu, who have had a taste of French football. The 24-year-old debuted for the Brazilians three years ago and has worked hard to entrench himself in the star-studded Downs team. From being ball-boy to first-team player, Mkhulise’s story has been a stuff of dreams. The attacking midfielder has been with Downs since 2012 when he started at the academy. He established himself as one of the key players for the Brazilians, with 34 appearances in all competitions last season. He is inspired by Percy Tau and he has been touted as the next Downs star. Sundowns haven’t had any export since they sold Tau to English side Brighton & Hove Albion.
