ANAL coronavirus swabs are now reportedly compulsory for anyone arriving in China even though there have been objections from other governments. The “humiliating” tests require inserting a cotton swab three to five centimetres into the anus and gently rotating it. According to the Mirror, China claims it is a more effective way to detect Covid, but critics say it has left people suffering from “psychological distress”. The swab tests were previously used in areas of China that had suffered outbreaks, however they are now being extended to airports, including in Beijing and Shanghai. Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) said stool tests may be most effective in identifying Covid-19 in kids. In a paper published in 2020, the CHUK experts said children and infants carry higher viral loads in their faeces than adults. A throat swab on a 52-year-old man in Weinan, a city in northern Shaanxi province, reportedly showed a negative result despite him displaying multiple tell-tale Covid symptoms.
