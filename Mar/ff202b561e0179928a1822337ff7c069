 ORLANDO Pirates barely raised a sweat when they cruised 3-0 past Chippa United in their DStv Premiership at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday. First-half goals from Deon Hotto and an own goal from Riaan Hanamub as well as the third from Ben Motswari in the second ensured the Buccaneers climbed up to the second spot on the log. Ayanda Mtshali made a mess of a clearance, allowing Deon to finish off effortlessly for the opener in the 39th minute. With a minute to go before the break, Hanamub directed a Fortune Makaringe shot into his net, paving the way for Bucs to record their third straight league win and a tenth in a row for them against the Chilli Boys. Bucs trail Mamelodi Sundowns by a point, although the latter have four games in hand. The Chilli Boys are winless in the league in five matches, their last win coming back in January when they thumped Black Leopards by the same scoreline.
