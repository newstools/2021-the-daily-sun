A 17-YEAR-OLD teenager is expected to appear in the Ventersdorp Magistrates Court today in connection with the murder of Mapula Khune, soccer star Itumeleng Khune’s sister. The body of 27-year-old Khune was found badly burnt in the backroom of her grandparents’ house in Ventersdorp, North West, last week. Colonel Adele Myburgh said a teenager was charged on Friday, 5 March in Ventersdorp. The incident happened on Thursday, 4 March at about 5am when neighbours saw smoke coming from a house in Tshing extension 2. “Emergency services were called, and after force opening a backroom they discovered the severely burnt body of Khune on top of her bed. Only the backroom was damaged during the fire,” she said. Residents have been up in arms hunting for the killers. “Since Friday, additional cases of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm have been reported as community street patrollers and family members have allegedly been assaulting alleged perpetrators for the murder,” she said. North West provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Sello Kwena praised police, who bust the suspect within a day. He cautioned members of the community not to take the law into their own hands. Police are investigating a murder case.
