North West police have arrested a teen for allegedly
murdering his brother during an argument in Taung. The argument, reportedly over money the two teens were
supposed to share, broke out on Saturday in Matolong Village. According to police, the siblings, aged 17 and 19, visited a
local tavern on Friday and returned home in the early hours of Saturday. "It is alleged that a fight ensued between the two
brothers, because of money that they were supposed to [share] amongst
themselves.Â  It is further alleged that
the parents tried to stop the fight, but the two brothers left the house and
continued with their fight on the streets," police spokesperson Lieutenant
Colonel Amanda Funani said. The brothers fell to the ground during the altercation and
the older brother had a stab wound to his stomach. He died at the scene. "The 17-year-old is currently under parental care and
was dealt with according to the Child Justice Act 75 of 2008. [An]
investigation into the matter continues," Funani added. SOURCE: NEWS24
