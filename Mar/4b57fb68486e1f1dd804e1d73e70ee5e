“MANCHASTER United. That’s all we care about now,” Pep Guardiola said ahead of Manchester City’s “Super Sunday” English Premiership clash against their fellow city rivals. This Manchester Derby cannot be missed for anything else considering the two clubs’ contrasting results, of late, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer led his charges to an unexpected goalless draw against Crystal Palace. But the night before, on Tuesday, City walked all over Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Etihad Stadium, thumping them 4-1 to stretch their lead on the standings to a credible 65 points, while as a result opening a 14 points gap between them and United. On Sunday when the warring sides meet at the Etihad Stadium, City’s slaughterhouse, all eyes will be on Ole, who has been criticised lately for the Palace result. Guardiola hailed an outstanding performance as City secured a 21st straight win against Wolves, but insists his side’s focus now switches straight to United. Gabriel Jesus will be among the leaders in the park, having shown his prowess on Tuesday when he grabbed a brace. “The champions are Liverpool. the crown belongs to them. We are in the best position right now to take them out and we are going to try, but they are the champions,” Guardiola told Sky Sport. “There are 33 points to play for. We are in a really good position – I did not expect to be in this position two or three months ago – but we need to be calm and compete. “I had a feeling we were going to be good. “I saw this morning the team, how focused they were when we warmed up. I thought they were ready. I told them, ‘now rest, and then Man United’.” Ole had not much words after Wednesday’s disappointing result, safe to say: “The attention quickly turns to our next game – Manchester derby. One of the biggest matches of the season needs the biggest of build-ups, and we’ll be ready.” SUNDAY FIXTURES:
