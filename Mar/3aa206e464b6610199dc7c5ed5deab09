Dear MizzB I’M 28-year-old lady and have been single for five years since my break up with my baby daddy. I have a sex partner whom I met a year ago. I’m developing feelings for him, but I’m afraid to tell him. Is it possible that I could lose him? Sista Dear Sista Sex partner arrangements usually end up with one or both partners catching feelings. As much as it is easy to make rules at the beginning of the whole arrangement, it’s not easy to abide to them. As time progresses and because you are human, bonds and connections are formed. It then becomes difficult to break apart. It is common to see most of these arrangements either turning into full-blown relationships or a break up. Expressing how you feel to the guy is a gamble from your side as he might receive or reject you. Either way you need to do what feels right for you. All the best!
