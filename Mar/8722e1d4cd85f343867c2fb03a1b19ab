CO-CHAIRMAN of the ministerial advisory committee on Covid-19, Professor Salim Abdool Karim, has stepped down, citing commitment to his HIV research. In a letter addressed to Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize dated 24 March, Prof Karim said the time had come for him to rededicate his time to his passion. He said it had suffered as he had devoted much of his time to the pandemic in the past year. He said serving on the advisory body and working alongside many outstanding scientists was rewarding. He said he was leading the committee in safe hands. “I wish to pay tribute to my colleagues who served and continue to serve on the committee – it’s a labour of love, grappling with an avalanche of new information daily, sifting through fact, fiction, conspiracy theories, assumptions and projections to provide science-based advice in the midst of substantial uncertainty,” he wrote. Earlier in the morning, Prof Karim was quoted as saying it would be advisable for government to upgrade the country’s alert level 1 ahead of the Easter holidays as a precaution to avoid super-spreader events arising from religious gatherings. His advice came amid fears the country could be headed for a third wave. It also came as the National Coronavirus Command Council was said to be meeting today (Thursday, 25 March). “I don’t know if we’ll have a third wave after Easter. But I don’t want to find out. I’d rather take precautions and reduce our chances of a third wave,” the professor was quoted as saying.
