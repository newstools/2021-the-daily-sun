BLACK Leopards first choice goalkeeper King Ndlovu shares with us his first experience on different issues on his life. My First car: A Toyota Tazz that I bought in 2012/13 season while playing for ABC Motsepe League side Soshanguve Sunshine. I drove that car for two years before I upgraded. My First Gloves: It was Nike brand that Mamazala (mother) bought them for me. I was 13-year-old attending primary school at Rosina Sedibane in Lodium. My First boots: It was a brand called Grandprix that my mom bought for R100 at Pep store when I was seven-year-old. The boots had a lot of colours like a Christmas tree, I enjoyed playing with them. My First time on plane: In 2008 I travelled from OR Tambo via Switzerland to play Youth World Cup in Copenhagen, Denmark. I was too scared, but it wasn’t only me who was on a plane for the first time. It was a great experience as we also connected another flight to Sweden then we travelled on bus for an hour to our destination. My First Movie:  It was a sports drama film directed by Danny Cannon and starring Kuno Becker about a young man with a rough background who is offered the chance to have trials with one of England's top football club. I watched the movie in Pretoria, I enjoyed it. My first salary: I earned R3000 playing for Soshanguve Sunshine in ABC Motsepe League. I spent some of the money with my girlfriend as I used to visit her in Joburg. I also bought myself a nice pair of takkies. My First Kiss: I was 11-year-old, I was scared to do it. My heart was pumping fast as if I will collapse. I still remember who she is as we also attended (TUT) Tshwane University of Technology together. She knows it because I used to tease her about it.
