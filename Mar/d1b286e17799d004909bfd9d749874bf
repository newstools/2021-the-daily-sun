DO you think you have seen the best of Mamelodi Sundowns striker Peter Shalulile? No, you haven't according to the Namibian national coach Bobby Samaria. Samaria told SunSport the best is yet to come from his compatriot at Downs. The 27-year-old star joined the Brazilians this season from Highlands Park and has been enjoying outstanding form. Some doubted if Shalulile would fit in at the 10-times PSL champions but the Windhoek born player is proving them wrong. So far, Shalulile has netted 12 goals in 22 games in all competitions. Shalulile was named DStv Premiership Player of the month for January and February on Monday for his form which has helped Downs climb to the top of the log. “Shalulile is a true talisman and a worthy ambassador for our country,” said Samaria. “Highlands Park knew his worth well before he started making headlines in the PSL. To fully understand and appreciate him you need to see him at training, he is a beast. "He works hard all the time. The guy (Shalulile) has energy for days. That is why we back home in Namibian are not surprised by what he is doing in South Africa. I think people will see the best of him." Added Samaria: “It is not a fluke that he is doing well in the PSL. What I love about him is that it is never about him but the whole team. "I just hope his teammates will continue to embrace him and supply him with service to help Sundowns do well. We are super proud not only him but our entire foreign legion doing duty at their various clubs in South Africa." Other former Namibian players who came to PSL  and make names for themselves are Mohamed Nauseb and Robert Nauseb  (both Kaizer Chiefs), Ronni Kanalelo (Sundowns), Henrico Botes (Moroka Swallows and Platinum Stars) and Ricardo Mannetti (Santos).
