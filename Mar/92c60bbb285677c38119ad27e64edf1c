FORMER Eskom CEO Brian Molefe denied being involved in the R1,6 billion paid to the Gupta company Tegeta. Molefe told the Zondo Commission yesterday that he was in hospital when the transaction happened. “I have no comment on that. I was not part of prepayment. I only got to know about it after I came back from hospital,” he said. He said he was admitted on 1 December 2015 and the prepayment decision was made on 9 December. He said he only came back to work in January 2016. The commission heard evidence from Hatch director, Henk Bester, that Gupta associate Salim Essa bragged that the Guptas had decided Molefe was going to be Eskom CEO months before he was appointed. R40K BET ENDS IN TEARS! “I know nothing about it. Furthermore, I don’t know Salim Essa. I have never met him. I don’t know what he looks like,” said Molefe. He said the only person who talked to him about the Eskom job was former public enterprises minister Lynne Brown. He said Brown told him they had serious problems at Eskom and wouldn’t even be able to pay salaries. She asked if he’d agree to be seconded to solve the crisis. He said he was employed as a permanent employee, but that was changed to contract. He said an argument started and the board took a resolution that when he leaves he’d be regarded as having worked until age 63. Molefe said in November 2016 former public protector Thuli Madonsela released the state of capture report accusing him of corruption without being consulted. “I decided perhaps it’s best to leave. Then I activated that agreement that when I leave I’d be regarded as leaving at 63,” he said.
