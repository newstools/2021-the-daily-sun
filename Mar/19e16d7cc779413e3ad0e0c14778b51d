SWALLOWS FC coach Brandon Truter believes their first defeat in almost a year is a wake-up call and insisted his players did well. The defeat was Swallows’ first since last year March. The Dube Birds had last lost a game on 8 March, losing 3-2 against the University of Pretoria last season, while still campaigning in the GladAfrica Championship. On Tuesday, Swallows were on the lead until the 85th minute against TS Galaxy who shocked them 2-1. Ruzaigh Gamildien converted from a spot-kick in the 50th minutes to put Swallows in the driving seat in a match played at Mbombela Stadium. However, Galaxy levelled matters through Lindokuhle Mbatha in the 84th minute before Bevan Fransman stole The Rockets' victory three minutes later to earn maximum points and break Swallows’ 12 month long standing record.The result left Swallows on fourth place with 30 points from 17 games, and Galaxy are in eighth spot with 22 points. "We controlled the game nicely for 85 minutes, and managed to go 1-0 up fairly comfortably. Then they put us under a bit of pressure. They put four or five players up upfront," Truter told SuperSport TV after the match. "They got a turnover and then scored via a deflection. The other one was a set-play. Two moments of madness, and we got punished." "This might be a wake-up call, but the boys did very well. I want to emphasise that. They are a bit down with the result." Truther added: "It is almost exactly a year since we lost our last game, so we will look to bounce back against TTM (Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila)." Swallows are now six points behind Mamelodi Sundowns, who remains the only team to taste defeat this season. Sundowns have played 16 games this season. They are currently busy with Caf Champions League commitments, and they will only resume DStv Premiership late this month.
