A PRE-TRIAL hearing for the three cops accused of the murder of Nateniel Julies has been postponed to next month. Sergeant Voster Netshiongolo, Sergeant Simon “Scorpion” Ndyalvana and Warrant Officer Caylene Whiteboy made a brief court appearance at the South Gauteng High Court on Friday, 19 March. Their case has been postponed to 22 April for disclosure of dockets from the state, for the defence team to prepare its argument. The case against the trio was transferred from the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto. Both Ndyalvana and Whiteboy will remain in custody while Netshiongolo is currently out on bail.

We just feel that Bridget and the family need to be given necessary time. “We will be dealing with the media,” said Pretorius. She said the justice system needs to ensure that Nateniel’s death is not in vain and that justice is served.  16-year-old Nateniel, who had Down syndrome, was shot and killed near his home in Eldorado Park, south of Joburg, last August. His death sparked outrage which saw community members marching to the police station demanding justice. The cops are facing charges of murder, possession of prohibited ammunition and defeating the ends of justice.
