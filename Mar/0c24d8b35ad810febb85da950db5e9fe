THEY haven’t kissed since March last year in respect of lockdown restrictions. But their relationship isn’t in any kind of trouble. In fact, Lindiwe Dlamini (30) and her partner Joseph Sithole (33) are madly in love and spend most of their time together, mostly indoors. The couple from Tsakane, Ekurhunei, told Daily Sun they’re afraid of the virus and don’t want to die. “We don’t want to be statistics. We want to beat this and the only way to do that is to stay home and avoid manga manga business,” she said. She said when lockdown started they stopped being touchy-feely. “We wear masks everywhere, even in the house. When we need something from the shops, only one of us goes out,” he said. He said the one who goes out takes their clothes off at the door when they return and heads straight to the bathroom to bath. Lindiwe said they avoid kissing at all costs as they believe the face is more exposed to the virus. They blow kisses at each other. In addition, the couple sleep separately, with Lindiwe on the bed and Joseph on the floor. And when they want to poke there’s no foreplay. They stare at each other and talk about poking to get aroused or watch porn videos. “We use protection, and it’s always doggy style to avoid a lot of contact,” they said. “We’ll continue like this until Covid-19 is over. We’ve gotten used to this life and enjoy it. “It brought something different to our love life.” Lindiwe said they never had flu since the outbreak of the virus. “We buy herbs like umhlonyane and other immune boosters.” The couple are unemployed and Joseph makes money through Hollywood betting. “I am lucky when it comes to betting. I am able to make at least R500 a day,” he said. They’ve been together for more than six years and don’t have kids. But they plan to have them after lockdown.
