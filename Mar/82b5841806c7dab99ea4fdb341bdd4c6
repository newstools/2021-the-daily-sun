THEY say different strokes for different folks, right? Well, in this context this is the closest thing to the truth and you’re just about to find out why. Women are what we call “varied human beings”. This is because they have different tastes for various things – from fashion to food and sexual preferences. They indeed have a beautiful mind of their own. Speaking about sexual preferences, women have their own sexual preferences when it comes to the 4-5. According to science, there are four different types of 4-5s and we take a closer look at which one of the four women like the most: 1
 . The big one A survey was conducted by renowned sexologist, Dr Vijaysarathi Ramanathan, on his website about the various sizes of the 4-5. While it’s known that the average 4-5 size is 14.15cm. A man with a 17cm tool is considered a big guy and, according to Dr Vijaysarathi Ramanathan’s survey, a big 4-5 can be fun as it can penetrate more, stimulating every part of the vagina. But the bad news is that it could hurt her badly and she might need more time to recover from the big action. 2. The curved one According to experts, a curved 4-5 during penetration would be touching the upper wall of the punani, where the G-spot is. This type of the 4-5 is preferred by women. 3. Captain hook This 4-5 is almost the same as the curved one, only that it is bent slightly downward from the tip. This type of 4-5 becomes a hindrance during the missionary position but is great for doggy-style. 4. Little one While we might underestimate its potential, the little guy is the safest when it comes to long-term relationships because it promises the right fun with less soreness and much less recovery time.
