IN a short social media statement, Bongani Zungu has pulled out of Bafana Bafana's two Afcon qualifiers. "Unfortunately I won’t be able to travel to South Africa to  represent my country. But I’d  like to wish the boys the best of luck," said the Rangers star who was willing to meet with his national teammates in Ethiopia due to Covid-19 restrictions in South Africa. The Scotland-based midfielder made a passionate plea to the SA Football Association (Safa) to join the national team for their Afcon qualifier against Sudan on Sunday, but indications are that he's struggling to find a connecting flight.Bafana have already been dealt a blow with Keagan Dolly of French club Montpelier, Carlisle midfielder Dean Furman and Al Jazira’s Thulani Serero all missing the qualifiers due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.But Brighton Hove and Albion forward Percy Tau was allowed to travel to Mzansi by his English Premier League club, and he's the go to man for Bafana.Most African countries have been affected by the Covid-19 regulations hence most European clubs refused their players to trave for the international week.Ghana will be without their English-based captain Andre Ayew, his brother Jordan and Arsenal’s Thomas Partey, who scored when the Black Stars beat Bafana 2-0 when the Afcon qualifiers started in November 2019, because of the same Covid-19 regulations in the UK.
