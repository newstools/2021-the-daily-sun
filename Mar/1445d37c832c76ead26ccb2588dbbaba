Afro pop singer Nomfundo Moh has made a song for lovers. The 20-year-old, whose real name is Nomfundo Ngcobo, released a single titled Lilizela in January. Speaking to SunBuzz, she said she felt the song is great for a debut single. “For years I featured on people’s songs because I wanted to find the perfect song and the perfect time to finally release my music. “I then wrote this song last year. It’s a love song about a woman appreciating her lover and thanking him for loving her. It also encourages people to look at the beauty of love.” Nomfundo, who started singing as a child, said the people around her are the reason she started singing. “I was inspired by the comments I got when I sang. I started singing at church when I was six years old and people really loved my voice,” she said. “That made me see I could make a career out of music. I started by listening to Brandy and singing her songs. As time went by I started writing my own songs and I’ve been writing and singing since.” ALSO READ |PICS: SKEEM SAAM ACTOR BECOMES A SANGOMA She started pursuing music professionally in 2018 when she was doing her first year at the University of KZN.

Then I decided to do it on the side. It’s been a great journey so far.” Nomfundo is working on her debut album, Amagama. “I’m not sure when I’ll release it yet, but I’ll announce everything soon. I worked very hard on the album. There are great features in it. Most importantly, I’ll be showing off my writing skills.”
