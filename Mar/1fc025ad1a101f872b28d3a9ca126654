FINALLY, the Premier Soccer League (PSL) referees have received their uniform. According to the Le Coq official, Roger Noades, the kit has been ready all along but just needed a Showman's name to be emblazoned on to it. PSL referee Akhona Makalina was excited to show off the uniform on social media alongside PSL referee Jelly Chavali. "The referees uniform has been delivered. What stalled the process was Showman, with the approvals and changes," said Noades. The referees' kit has been an issue since Safa signed a deal with insurance company Outsurance in 2018 on a five-year deal. Referees will wear this new uniform in PSL games post this international Fifa break.
