Dear MizzB I’M 20 years old and I lost my virginity to my boyfriend of two years. Since we’ve had sex, he has changed and no longer gives me attention. I feel like he wanted me for sex. Will he dump me?  ) Sista Dear Sista People get into relationships for different reasons and unfortunately not all are good. ALSO READ: THREESOME BIRTHDAY GIFT! Sex is part of the motivation for others to stay in relationships, even though they are no longer interested in their partners. Jumping into conclusions will not help as he is the only one who can tell you what his intentions are. Sex does not keep people together and when the other partner wants out of the relationship, there’s nothing that you can do. All the best!
