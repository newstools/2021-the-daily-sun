DID you know? Swallows FC’s recipe for all their successes under coach, Brandon Truter, has been their believe in God.  Truter has started a Bible Studies class with his players and he says this works wonders for him and his motivated players. His religion seems to have rubbed off well on his players and works like magic since the start of this season when they were unbeaten in all competition until that incredible record ended on Friday when  they lost 4-3 on penalties to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila after the teams played to a 2-2 draw at full-time. Also relying on his religion is former Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo who has left his fans bemused after posting a picture of himself dressed in a thobe (a long robe worn by male in Muslim region).  This has confused many of his fans and Nigerians on whether Ighalo, who now plies his trade for Saudi Arabian side Al Shabab has changed his faith to Muslim. Although, Ighalo looked stunning in white attire with his head covered like a Muslim who just completed a Holy Pilgrimage, this saw him criticised on social media while others praised him on his new look. Ighalo seems to have joined serious Christian, Jew, or Muslim who express religious conviction in sport.
