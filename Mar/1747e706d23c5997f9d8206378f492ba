PARENTS and pupils can finally breathe a sigh of relief. The North West government kept its promise and delivered scholar transport to pupils at Slagboom and Mmukubyane. Pupils were forced to walk over 8km in the bushes, which led to a 13-year-old being raped and her two friends robbed. Daily Sun published the story on 26 February, headlined “Pupil raped on way home”. Residents closed down three schools and demanded government provides transport. It delivered but they were sad after a child was raped. The mother of the victim was relieved no other child would go through what hers did. The child went back to school as she didn’t want to fall back on her studies. “It had been difficult for her, but I’m happy her ordeal was not in vain,” she said. According to Lesiba Monkwe, a deputy director in the MEC’s office, the transport was halted because the service provider terminated his contract after some enquiries from them. “The provider was escalating travelling kilos by 74 a day, and when the department wanted to pay him according to the actual kilos he terminated the contract.”
