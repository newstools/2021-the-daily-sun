THE United Democratic Movement (UDM) President Bantu Holomisa has said the whole Safa structure should be looked at too after the association let go of coach Molefi Ntseki today. Holomisa, who is not shy about letting his feelings be known in matters of football in the country, said firing Ntseki will not solve the situation. Ntseki was let go from his duties after Bafana embarrassingly lost the crucial Afcon qualifying match against Sudan in Khartoum on Sunday. The 1996 Afcon champions needed a draw to reach the tournament finals in Cameroon in January and February next year. “Molefi Ntseki sacked as Bafana Bafana head coach - nonsense, he is a sacrificial lamb. It’s simple, we don’t have material,” said Holomisa on his social media account. Ntseki was appointed by Safa in August 2019 on a five-year contract to replace Stuart Baxter, whom he assisted a month earlier in the Afcon finals in Egypt. Ntseki’s mandate was to take Bafana to Afcon next year and also to the Fifa World Cup finals in 2022 in Qatar. Holomisa insists that the failure of Bafana is down to the country’s shortcomings to produce top finishers. “We always rely on foreign players at club level instead of producing our own, especially in the striking dept. SAFA must wake up!” Ntseki was in charge of just for nine games in all competitions. He won four, lost three and drew two.
