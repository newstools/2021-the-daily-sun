THE ex-cop
was approached by two armed suspects while buying firewood along the Emanguzi
main road in northern KZN on 10 November. They
grabbed him by the neck and pointed guns at him. Patrick
Pedlar (57) resisted and shots were fired. He was shot twice in the head but
shot suspect Mandlenkosi Khumalo (28) twice. Khumalo
died at the scene and Pedlar in hospital the next day. Colonel
Thembeka Mbele said: “One suspect managed to escape. An air handgun used by the
deceased suspect was recovered, as well as the 9mm pistol of the deceased
victim.” Vryheid
police took over investigations later that month. The suspect
who’d fled was soon identified. Detectives arrested the 27-year-old on Friday,
19 March. He’s
expected to appear in the Emanguzi Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 23 March.
