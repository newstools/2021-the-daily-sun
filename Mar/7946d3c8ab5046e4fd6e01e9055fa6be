DRESSED in beautiful and colorful Ndebele attire a man was turned away from a shopping mall. He was told his cultural attire was not decent enough for the mall as it's a public place. The incident took place at the infamous Clicks store at Boulders Shopping Centre in Midrand, north of Joburg. He was told that his traditional outfit was not decent for the mall and told to leave the mall. The man, who is apparently the store manager, said he didn't condone dressing in traditional attire and ordered the lady to leave. "I don't condone this in my mall, please leave," he can be heard in a video posted on Twitter. The man in Ndebele attire tried to tell the centre manager that their attire is as good as the western clothes the manager was wearing, but he wasn't having any of that. As if chasing them out of the mall was not enough, he also ordered the shopkeepers not to serve the Ndebele man and his entourage. "Don't sell them whatever they want to buy, they must just leave the store," he said. Saddest reality in Africa, I was subjected to inside the @Clicks_SA store at The Boulders Shopping Center. By the center manager, who said it was his shopping complex. I was told that I'm wearing inappropriate I must go & Omega risk solutions harassed me #NdebeleTwitter pic.twitter.com/klzmTQspJO  The conduct of the manager didn't sit right with Twitter users who came out guns blazing after seeing the video. Pakiso Motsoari tweeted, "People go to malls and other public places wearing bum shorts and other revealing clothing and it's never indecent. This gentleman is not even naked, he is even adhering to CoVid-19 regulations by having his mask on. This mall must be boycotted at all cost." Khethelo Zwane said," This guy is black, African and middle age. Where are the people he grew up with, what did they teach him throughout his life? This one is a disappointment. I could maybe understand if it was a skrr skrr person but this from a person in his 40/50!"
