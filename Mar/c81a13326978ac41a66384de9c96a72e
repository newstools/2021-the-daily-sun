IT SEEMS there may be a bun in the oven for Babes Wodumo. The queen of gqom is allegedly pregnant with Mampintsha’s baby. It is alleged that the controversial couple has been trying hard to keep the pregnancy a secret. But they apparently failed dismally during Babes’ birthday party that was held at Eyadini Lounge on Thursday night. At the party, Babes was wearing a tight dress that exposed her big tummy. Even the flowers that she used to hide it couldn’t help. Sources close to the couple said they are excited. ALSO READ: UKHOZI FM FANS: BRING BACK TSHATHA!  “The two have been through a lot. So this baby is therapy to them,” said one source. Another source said: “They don’t want the public to know about this because they don’t want to draw unnecessary attention which might affect the pregnancy.” Her manager and sister Nondumiso Simelane said: “So what if she’s pregnant? Ungenaphi wena?” And when Daily Sun called her back, she said: “Please ask Babes and Mampintsha. This is their private and personal affair. So please talk to them. I doubt that you will get them since they are tired from the party last night.”   Babes and Mampitsha's phones were-off at the time of publishing. Even Twitter users noticed Babes’ belly. A twitter user Tboogie@djplatinumore1 said: “2-3 weeks ago Babes Wodumo was at MacG drinking gin. By the end of the potcast she was drunk... and she’s pregnant?” Chamain Motsamai replied: “And its showing already.” Speaking to the media outside Pinetown Magistrates Court in 2019 where he was attending an assault case after the video that showed him beating Babes, Mampintsha claimed Babes’ family didn’t want her to get pregnant because she was a breadwinner to her family. Babes Wodumo's father Bishop Welcome Simelane said he was not aware of Babes's pregnancy but has seen birthday photos. "Let me speak to my daughter first and get the facts. I'm sure she'll tell me what's going on," said Simelane. pic.twitter.com/neMgs8wDUD
