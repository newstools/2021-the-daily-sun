SPRINGBOK captain Siya Kolisi will make his debut for the Cell C Sharks in Friday night’s Kick Off 2021 clash with the Vodacom Bulls in at Kings Park (7pm). Kolisi has been included in the starting team in his regular No6 jersey that he wore for the DHL Stormers and also wears for the Springboks. Sharks head coach Sean Everitt has thrown in a number of players who were part of the conditioning group and are now ready to play. “It was lovely to take the field again,” Everitt enthused. “We were really hungry to play and being back in action was really special.” “It’s going to be a big one, I assume the Bulls will also play their senior players. It’s going to be a huge clash, one we’re really looking forward to. “There’s a vibe amongst the boys, a lot of excitement.” Flying winger Yaw Penxe was back in action for the Sharks last week after training with the conditioning group for the opening two matches of the preparation series and is again named in the starting line-up. Given the team’s goals in this series of matches, not so much about the results as creating finesse around the style of play, the game plan and developing depth, Penxe believes the team has really benefited. Penxe tols Sharks website: “We did achieve what we wanted to in fine-tuning our processes, and in our losses, it was discipline here or there or just minor errors. “Going into this final game, we’re looking to put everything into place and hopefully put in a really proper performance.” SHARKS TEAM: Anthony Volmink, Sbu Nkosi, Lukhanyo Am (captain), Marius Louw, Yaw Penxe, Boeta Chamberlain, Jayden Hendrikse, Sikhumbuzo Notshe, Henco Venter, Siya Kolisi, Ruben van Heerden, Emile van Heerden, Thomas du Toit, Fez Mbatha, Ox Nche.
