MAMELODI Sundowns' striker Kermit Erasmus will be out for six weeks due to an ankle injury. This was confirmed by Sundowns team doctor Carl Tabane on Friday afternoon. The striker was substituted just after 12 minutes after replacing Gaston Sirino last Saturday when Sundowns played against Stellenbosch FC. This means Erasmus will miss Bafana Bafana back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan. "Everybody saw on TV how the injury happened. It looked like a horrible injury even ourselves (doctors) we were worried," said Tabane. "However, I am happy to say it is not bad as we thought. He got two ankle sprains, and the outlook is quite good. No operative surgery will be needed. We are going to manage everything consecutively. "He has actually commenced with his rehabilitation and is looking quite well. The estimated return to play should be about four to six weeks. It might be earlier because of our experience working with ankle injuries. We happy to say he will be back soon." Sundowns' medical team has dealt with similar injuries in the past, with Thapelo Morena, Phakamani Mahlambi, and Sirino sustaining similar injuries. Tabane has detailed some of the processes they follow when dealing with an ankle injury. He said: "As Sundowns medical team with our vast experience with this ankle injuries, today we were even discussing on how many ankle injuries we have had. "We have set steps as to how we managed these injuries. Primary, he has been assessed by us medical doctors. Then he goes on to physio to manage the swelling make sure the ankle is not stiff. Then he will commence with the rehabilitation which I've said it has commenced." Another Downs striker Peter Shalulile will miss his first match since he joined Sundowns at the beginning of the season. Shalulile is serving a one-match suspension after accumulating four yellow cards.
