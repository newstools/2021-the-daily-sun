GUGU Msimanga was happy and shocked when she was told she was pregnant with triplets. She expected her partner to share her joy, but he dumped her after she told him. The 29-year-old from Zamane in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun: “He told me to go as he couldn’t afford to look after that many kids.” Gugu is now struggling to care for her babies, who are three months old.

She said she used to live in a rented room, but she had to move out as she couldn’t afford to pay for it any more. She moved in with her gogo, Nobelungu Khumalo (67). Gugu said her gogo’s RDP was very small and they had to push together two sofas so she could sleep with her baby girls – Amahle, Sphesihle and Sibahle. “It’s uncomfortable but I have no choice. My gogo took me in because she couldn’t leave me on the street,” she said. Gogo Nobelungu said the babies were healthy but they needed formula because their mum was not breastfeeding them.
