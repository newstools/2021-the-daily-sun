A
WELL-KNOWN pastor from Seshego in Limpopo, who’s serving two life sentences for
rape, has suffered another blow. The Limpopo
High Court found the man guilty of more rape charges involving girls under the
age of 16! Judge
Gerrit Muller on Monday found Pastor James Thubakgale (58) guilty on five
counts of rape, common assault and of calling church members witches. The Divine
Deliverance Church leader’s reign of terror took place from 2010 until 2017
when he was reported. During
trial more than two weeks ago, the court heard the suspect would promise
victims marriage, telling them it was God’s will. The pastor
would rape them at a lodge, in his vehicles, or in rooms he was renting on
their behalf. He targeted
young girls who were members of his church. The judge
told the pastor: “You used your power as a leader of the church to commit the
crimes. “You’d
induce fear in your complainants by telling them if they refused to marry or
have sex with you, God would punish them for disobedience and there would be
death and sickness in their families.” Thubakgale
would scold the victims if they defied him, calling them witches possessed by
evil spirits. He’d assault them in full view of fellow congregants. He’d demand
congregants bring all their money to church, including their retirement
savings. Last
September, Thubakgale was sentenced to two life terms on two counts of raping
minor girls – incidents that happened in 2011 and 2013 in Mankweng. Limpopo NPA
spokeswoman, Mashudu Malabi-Dzangi, urged community members experiencing terror
by church members or leaders to report them to the authorities. The case
was postponed to 24 March for sentencing.
