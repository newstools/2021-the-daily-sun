Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer says his side will have to be at the top of their game to beat Kaizer Chiefs in the Soweto Derby at FNB Stadium on Sunday, brushing aside the notion they are heavy favourites. Pirates have already defeated Chiefs three times in all competitions this season, scoring seven goals and conceding only one, but Zinnbauer says the AmaKhosi have more than enough quality to defeat his team.“We know they have quality players and a quality coach [Gavin Hunt], he knows exactly how to fight for titles. He has a lot of experience and knows what to say to the players,” Zinnbauer told reporters.“We know they are struggling a bit in the league, but there are signs they are coming better and better. The mood [at Pirates] is good at the moment, but we know it is a special game and we will need full concentration if we are to win the points.”Pirates could claim a fourth successive victory over Chiefs for the first time in their history in what is also the 100th league meeting between the sides, but Zinnbauer believes his team should not get sucked into looking at records and simply focus on the three points.“We have to win the game, that is the most important. We have a lot of work to do, we cannot speak about four wins in a row, we have to win this game and focus on this match only.“It is not important for me that it is the 100th [league] Soweto Derby, yes for the journalists, supporters and the clubs maybe, but for me as a coach you don’t get more than three points in this game.“It is a hard game for us against a top opponent and we will have to play well.” -SuperSport
