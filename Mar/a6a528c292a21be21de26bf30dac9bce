LATE human rights lawyer Advocate George Bizos inspired Fana Mabuza to study law. Bizos, who represented a number of freedom fighters including Nelson Mandela, helped pay Fana’s fees at Unisa during the final year of his LLB degree. Bizos died in September last year, leaving Fana struggling to pay his bills. The 39-year-old from Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni, first met Bizos at the Legal Resources Centre in Joburg in 2014. Bizos was struggling to get out of his car, so he helped him to his office and carried his briefcase. “One day he advised me to study law at Unisa,” he said. “He paid for my registration and taught me about the Constitution and history. “He was like an angel and nothing was impossible to him. “I know he’d have settled my fees if he was here. His death has devastated me. “He spoke as if God had whispered in his ear. He always had good advice and I loved every minute I spent with him.” Fana said although Bizos helped him with his school fees, he often paid for himself when he could. “He only helped me when I couldn’t pay,” he said. “I’d try to hide it from him that I was struggling, but he’d want to see my results and to know what was going on with my studies.” He only needs to complete a few modules before he can graduate. “I don’t know how I performed last semester because I can’t access my results. I didn’t pay,” he said. “I want to graduate so I can make Bizos proud.” Mabuza pleaded with SunReaders to help him pay his school fees. “He always told me he looked forward to my graduation day. I thought he’d be there to see me.”
