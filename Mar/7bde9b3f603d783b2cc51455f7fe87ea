There were mixed emotions as JMPD’s Chief Chaplain
Dr. Phinda Ngwenya’s funeral service was held at Roodepoort City Hall. Family, friends, and colleagues spoke fondly of the
man who respected and enforced the law, motivated his peers, prayed for
everyone’s wellbeing, and loved his family, his children while hiding their
anger and pain because of his death. The respected Chaplin was laid to rest at West Park
Cemetery.
