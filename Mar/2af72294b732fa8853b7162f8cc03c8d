THE South African Post Office has moved to assure South Africans who receive the R350 Social Relief of Distress grant that all the money owed to them will be paid. Post office spokesman Johan Kruger confirmed this to Daily Sun on Saturday, 20 March. He added: “All beneficiaries should also know that there’s no deadline for them to collect their grant from the post office. The funds that are waiting for them do not expire, and they can collect it later if it suits them. “The post office has also introduced a system to reduce waiting time for beneficiaries who collect their R350 grant. The system will also make it easier for beneficiaries depending on the last three digits of their ID number. Since 22 March is a public holiday, the days move one day forward after that,” said Kruger. He said the first week of each month is reserved for paying grants to the elderly, those living with disabilities and for child grants. “This schedule is displayed at post office branches and is on the post office website www.postoffice.co.za. And the post office has introduced separate queues at its branches to reduce waiting time and to ensure social distancing. “One queue is reserved for beneficiaries of the R350 grant while the other queue is for all other transactions. There are queue walkers who check ID numbers and help customers to collect their grant on the correct day,” he said. For more information clients are encouraged to call Sassa on 0800 601011 from 8am to 4pm from Monday to Friday.
