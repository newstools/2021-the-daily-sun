POLICE are likely to be attacked or
harmed by criminals. But on Sunday, that wasn’t the case as
two Joburg Metro Police officers were hospitalised after they were attacked by
'men of God.’ In a statement, JMPD spokesman
Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the officers, a female JMPD Superintendent,
one female Inspector and five officers attended a noise complaint at a church
in Midway, Soweto. “On their arrival, the officers were
surrounded by a group of aggressive male churchgoers who thumped onto the JMPD
patrol vehicles. “Officers used pepper fog to disperse the
group and called for backup. Rubber bullets were then used to disperse the
aggressive churchgoers who damaged JMPD patrol vehicles and injured two
officers, one officer had to be taken to Milpark Hospital. Two churchgoers were
also injured, one was taken to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital,” Minnaar said. Several church members were arrested,
including the pastor of that church. They were charged at Moroka Police
Station for public violence, assault, malicious damage to property and
contravention of the Disaster Management Act as more than two thousand people
were attending the church service.
