STELLENBOSCH FC coach Steve Barker is not happy with how things have gone this year. However, Barker said the DStv Premiership Cape Town derby against Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday (3pm) is an opportunity to turn things around. Since the year started, the Stellies have had a horror show. They have won only once, which was against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the first game of the year. It is now eight games in all competitions without a victory. In these matches, Barker’s side have lost six including the last four matches. This has resulted in the pressure mounting on him. Stellenbosch are in 13th position on the table with 15 points after 16 matches level on points with TTM. “It is our opportunity to get our season back (on track). We are not happy with where we are in the league,” said Barker who will be without centre back Alan Robertson due to suspension. “This is a chance to turn things around and importantly, the camp has been good. Our game against Mamelodi Sundowns (on Tuesday) was postponed and that gave us an extra time to work on things, refresh the minds and bodies.” Stellies also face a City side that have also struggled to get things going this year. They have not had a win in their last five games in all competitions. City’s last win was a 4-0 mauling of Bloemfontein Celtic in the Nedbank Cup last-32 early last month. However, when it comes to the league, Olde Jan Riekerink side’s last victory was against Golden Arrows in January. With these two clubs having had their fair share of bad results Barker expects an “intense” game. “Our previous encounters with City have been tightly fought affairs. This is an important match for us,” said Barker.
