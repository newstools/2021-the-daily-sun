ZULU king Goodwill Zwelithini has not been buried, yet hidden tensions and squabbles have already started to come out within the monarchy. The Zulu monarchy prime minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi revealed on Saturday, 13 March there was a squabble when they removed the king’s body from Durban to Nongoma, KZN, which made him cry. He said he’d agreed with the king’s wives that his body would go straight to the local mortuary. “On our way to Nongoma I heard some Zulu princes and princesses changed plans behind my back,” he said. “I heard they wanted the king’s body to go to all royal palaces before being kept at the mortuary.” Buthelezi said he was hurt and had to call Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and Police Minister Bheki Cele to stop the royal house from breaking Covid-19 regulations as the king also had Covid-19.  “I told the ministers and royal house that I will never go to the royal house if they continued to ignore my decisions. “Mkhize asked me to calm down and intervened. The king’s body was finally kept at Icebo Lethu Mortuary in Nongoma, a few kilometres from the palace,” he said. Buthelezi revealed this was not the first time the royal family had a problem with him as prime minister. “In 1968 I almost didn’t bury my cousin King Bhekuzulu because many of the princes attacked me, asking what would happen to me because I was protected by him.” MENZI NGUBANE HAS PASSED ON! He said although he and Zwelithini appeared close, there was bad blood between them. “Although the king used to hurt me, I didn’t allow our differences to stop me from doing my duties as Zulu monarchy prime minister. “I didn’t hold grudges against the king. I want to come clean and forgive him so he can go well,” said Buthelezi. The funeral details are still to be announced.
