AT the age of 62, most people would have completely forgotten about school to focus on ageing gracefully and spending time with their grandchildren. But for Zambian gogo Maureen Ngoma, it has become the start of a new phase for her in education. The mother of nine recently joined the Senga Lumbwe Basic School in Lusaka under adult literacy as a grade 8 pupil. “I want to work in a big office and give my service to the people when I finish school,” she said. According to The Times of Zambia, Maureen aspires to join the Zambia Army, or join politics and vie for the Lusaka Central Parliamentary seat once she’s done with her education. The mother of nine said independent women who work in respectable offices inspire her. She had very minimal formal education, and this stood in her way of being like them. This is the reason she decided to go back to where she went off-track and pick up the pieces. Maureen’s educational journey came to a halt 45 years ago when she dropped out of school, aged 17, to get married.
