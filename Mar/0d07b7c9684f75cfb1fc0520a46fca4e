 CHIPPA United are looking at ending their six match winless run when they host Swallows Fc in a DStv Premiership fixture at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). The Chilli Boys last tasted a league victory in January when they defeated Black Leopards 3-0. With them doing well in the Nedbank Cup, coach Dan Malesela's charges will be looking at taking the cup form into the league on Saturday. Chippa winger, Anthony Laffor who has been enjoying his football at the Eastern Cape side said he is keen to lead his side to a win over Swallows ahead of their encounter.“We have a big game against Swallows. We know that they are desperate for a win," said laffor. "In our last game against them, we played a draw. This time around, if we listen to what the coach wants us to do, I think we will be successful." The former Mamelodi Sundowns player thanked the coaching staff for believing in him and also revealed that he has decided to guide players who want to be successful.“Since I came here, I have been getting game time. I just want to thank the coaches, the technical staff and my teammates for believing in me. If the coach does not believe in you, you can’t start a game,” he said. “I have been working so hard, now I am starting to gel with the guys very well. It took time to get used to them but now everything is fine and we are happy."
