One of the most important routes to maturity is to be careful of what you say to others. We can’t run away from the fact that social media platforms have given us a way to acquire and disseminate information. The paradox is that the same social media platforms are used to broadcast hatred, lack of compassion, racial slurs and propaganda to suppress those who’re not connected to the elites. Some people have a tendency of “writing what they like” on social media without considering the ramifications of what they’re commenting on and writing about. These people feel that as long as they are not seen or are using pseudonyms, which make them unidentifiable, they have a right to terrorise their victims on social media. The unfortunate aspect of this culture is that it creates a selfish and inhumane society. We don’t take into consideration how the victims of these attacks feel after being humiliated. People must be guided by morals and compassion. - Letter by Pascal Machai, Vosloorus
