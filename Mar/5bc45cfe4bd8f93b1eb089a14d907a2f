IF YOU didn’t know how helicopters are transported, now you do. In an Instagram account, creative_engineerrr has shared pictures of Mil Mi-26 Halo helicopters being transported through a city. On the post, creative_engineerrr said: “I’m not sure what the story is behind the movement of these Mil Mi-26 Halo helicopters, through what I believe is a town in Belgium. “But based on what I see here, I’ll definitely be trusting ABN Special Transport to handle all of my future Mi-26 shipping needs.” The huge helicopters caused a stir in the town as they navigated through the electricity lines and narrow roads.
