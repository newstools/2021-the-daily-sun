THE late Philimon "Chippa" Masinga was the country's trusted striker and he has made South Africa happy in many ways. The bully but polite Masinga, who passed away on 13 January 2019, was feared by opposition defenders. With his eyes watching you straight in the face, opposition players would just melt in fear and he would hammer the ball into the net. Boasting 58 Bafana Bafana caps and 18 goals, the Klerksdorp born made his international debut in July 1992 against Cameroon - South Africa's first match following readmission of the country to international football. In an African Cup of Nations qualifier versus Zambia in 1992, Masinga became the first South African ever to be sent off in an international match. Bubbly as he was, Masinga was in the Bafana side when South Africa won the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations and when they finished second to Egypt in the 1998 Afcon. He will always be remembered by the all important decisive goal in the 1997 game against the Republic of the Congo that took South Africa to the 1998 World Cup in France, which saw coach Clive Barker running around the field with his hands stretched out open to resemble wings of an aeroplane
