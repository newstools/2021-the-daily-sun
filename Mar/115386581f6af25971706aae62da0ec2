THE path is cleared for Patrice Motsepe to cruise to
victory in the upcoming Caf presidential elections.  This is after Ivorian Jacques Anouma became the latest
candidate to pull out of the race and throw his weight behind the South African
businessman.  Senegal FA president Augustin Senghor on Friday announced
he was pulling out of the race and pledged his support to Motsepe.  Together with the third candidate, Ahmed Yahya of
Mauritania, Anouma and Senghor will sign an agreement in Nouakchott in which
they will agree to give up their bids in exchange for the post of advisor and
two vice-presidencies respectively.  This means Motsepe may be elected unopposed as the eighth
president of Caf at the 12 March congress in Rabat, Morocco.  “After several reflections and consultations, I decided
to give up my candidacy for the election to the presidency of CAF,” Anouma told
an Ivorian TV programme on Friday.  Senghor, the Senegal FA president, posed a serious threat
to Motsepe as he enjoyed the backing of the key West Africa constituency.  But he issued a statement declaring his support for the
Mamelodi Sundowns supremo.  “Taking into account the particular context of this
campaign, we have decided to accept the consensual proposal submitted to us by
Fifa, Morocco and Egypt, in the name of the supreme interest of the unity of
African Football,” said Senghor.  “It seems to us that this is the best decision that we
could take after a lucid analysis of the current situation of CAF and of the
imperative need to favour a synergy of actions of all the skills to rectify it
- a Team to raise African football.  Senghor admitted his decision will not be “shared by all
for various reasons”.  But he has insisted it is a good decision.
