Special funerals should be for poor people, not public figures who earn a fat salary every month. Public figures can bury themselves without any difficulty, but destitute people can’t. If the president has the power to designate a special official funeral to a public figure, then he can do so to destitute people. Why should the poor struggle to bury their loved ones while public figures are using taxpayers’ money? Why does our president give help to people who don’t need it and doesn’t help those who need it the most? People can’t give their loved ones a decent burial because they are jobless. Which better life for all is the ANC talking about? Let those who don’t need help bury themselves and pay attention to those who need it. Mtititi Altein
