President Cyril Ramaphosa has stressed that the wearing of masks in public places is still required and the failure to wear one remains an offence. Ramaphosa said land border posts that have been closed throughout the lockdown period will remain closed, while the other 20 will remain open. He said only five airports will be open for international travel with standard infection control measures. These include OR Tambo, Cape Town, King Shaka, Kruger Mpumalanga and Lanseria airports. The president further warned that the easing of restrictions didn’t mean the public should let their guard down. “As we ease restrictions, we cannot let our guard down. The few remaining restrictions under alert level 1 are meant to maintain low levels of infections and, in particular, to prevent super-spreading events.” “The country has now clearly emerged from the second wave. New infections, admissions to hospital and deaths have fallen significantly and continue to decline steadily,” said Ramaphosa. The president said the decline in infections was due to a combination of public health measures introduced, changes in behaviour and accumulating immunity in those who became infected.
