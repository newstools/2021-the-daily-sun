ACTOR Thobani Nzuza is in mourning. The talented actor, best known for his roles as Kehla on Uzalo and Mndeni on eHostela, recently shared that his grandmother has died. “And today she passed away,” he said. Remembering moments he shared with her, Thobani shared a screenshot of an interview he had with TshisaLIVE about how his grandmother used to tease him, using his role as a Ben 10 on Uzalo, to make more grandkids. He said although his gogo used to make fun of him and his on-screen sugar mamas, she couldn’t handle seeing him as Mndeni on eHostela.
