ACTRESS Nomzamo Mbatha was on Thursday on The Daily Show hosted by fellow South African Trevor Noah. In welcoming her, he said it was an amazing day for him, because not only did he get to celebrate the actress as a fellow South African, “I get to celebrate your success in the most successful movie of the year”. Her movie Coming 2 America, which also stars Hollywood A-listers Eddie Murphy and Wesley Snipes, broke Amazon Prime records and became the most streamed movie of 2021. She told Trevor the experience of being in the movie still felt like an out-of-body experience. “It’s been an incredible experience, like a full circle moment for me. I flew from New York to Switzerland and the UAE and I was supposed to fly from the UAE to South Africa to host the Sama Awards.

I told him I’d spent a lot of money flying in and out, these auditions are not working out, and I wasn’t going to spend a penny more,” she said. She changed her mind when her agent told her the role she was going to audition for was a lead role in Coming 2 America. She said she changed her flight destination and flew from Dubai to LA. “I made it into the offices of Leon Butler for the audition. It was a process because of the visa process,” said the actress.
