KAIZER Chiefs have ended Orlando Pirates’ recent dominance in the Soweto derby. The Glamour Boys edged Bucs 1-0 in the 100th Soweto Derby league meeting played at FNB Stadium on Sunday. Amakhosi had their talismanic striker Samir Nurkovic to thank as he scored the all-important goal to hand Chiefs maximum points. Chiefs ended a wretched run in the derby this season having failed to beat Bucs in their past meetings this season. The result catapulted Amakhosi to ninth place in the standings having started the match in 11th place. Amakhosi coach Gavin Hunt made four changes to his team with Nurkovic, Daniel Cardoso, Reeve Frosler and Siyabonga Ngezana coming into the side. His counterpart, Josef Zinnbauer, made only one change with Siphesihle Ndlovu came into the starting line-up in place of Fortune Makaringe. Siyabonga Mpontshane was once again preferred in goal in Richard Ofori's absence. Amakhosi looked determined to turn their fortunes around in this fixture in recent times with Bernard Parker signaling intentions early with a long-range shot that slightly over the crossbar. Parker then looked to provide an assist for Happy Mashiane whose first-time shot could not trouble Mpontshane in the Bucs goal. Bucs dominated possession in the first half but they could not fashion any clear goal-scoring chances with Chiefs’ defence solid. It was not until the second half that the game sparked into life as Nurkovic popped up with an acrobatic finish. Bucs threw everything they had at Chiefs from there but they could not breach the Glamour Boys’ stout defence.
