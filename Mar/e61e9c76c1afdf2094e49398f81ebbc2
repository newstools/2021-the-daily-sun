TENSIONS have been running high at the Zondo Commission recently. Emotions were raised when Advocate Dali Mpofu was cross-examining Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan on Tuesday. Advocate Michelle le Roux got into a heated argument with Mpofu, who represents former SARS commissioner Tom Moyane. As the commission was wrapping up on allegations of racism levelled again Gordhan at some point by Moyane, the minister’s lawyer interjected and asked him how it felt to be called a racist. This didn’t sit well with Mpofu, who objected for Gordhan to make a brief comment. Le Roux then came in, trying to explain why she wanted the minister to address the racism issue again. For Context of earlier Tweet! @AdvDali_Mpofu was in middle of a point having raised an objection, #PravinGordhan's Counsel cut him & was allowed by @StateCaptureCom Chair. Adv #Mpofu not impressed as He couldn't finish his point. Commission continues on #SABCNews Wednesday. pic.twitter.com/elMF07tFAZ  Mpofu then pointed out to the chairman he still had the floor and shouted “Shut up, shut up!” at Le Roux. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo addressed Mpofu, telling him that he was still the man in charge. Even Ramaphosa in his mediocre conception of anti-black racism knows that you must tell a racist to Shut Up! pic.twitter.com/0GdtN0Qhkg  At the end of the examination, Mpofu asked Zondo for a chance to address the incident – he indicated he was not happy with the way he was treated.
