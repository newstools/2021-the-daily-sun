TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach Dylan Kerr is hoping to have two of his star players, Alfred Ndengane and Rhulani Manzini back when the DStv Premiership resumes after the Fifa international break. The duo missed Tshakhuma’s 2-0 defeat against AmaZulu at the weekend as they are still to face the club’s disciplinary committee after they were allegedly involved in a training ground punch-up last week. Ndengane had to be rushed to the nearest medical centre to be stitched on his forehead. TTM, who are fighting to move away from the relegation zone will host log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns in their next league assignment at Peter Mokaba Stadium on 6 April (3.30pm). “Every coach wants to have all his players in the team,” said Kerr. “But there are situations which, as a coach, are beyond you. I hope this can be sorted soon and we can focus on playing football with one goal of helping this team move away from the danger zone. I hope to have all the players available for our next game.” Tshakhuma are currently second from bottom with 16 points from 19 league matches. They are only three points ahead of bottom side Black Leopards. But the Englishman is confident his side will survive relegation. “Honestly, we have a good squad and genuine players who want to do well for this club,” said the former Black Leopards and Baroka coach. “Despite losing to AmaZulu, the trip home from Durban was amazing because the players were in a reflective mood all the way home which was good and healthy because it shows they cared about the result. “So, I have no doubt that we will move from the relegation zone.”
