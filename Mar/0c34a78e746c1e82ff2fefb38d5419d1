EVEN though the recent heavy rainfall filled up dams, it left problems in its wake. It damaged 95% of dirt roads in Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo. Villagers struggle to move around after the rain dug big channels and ditches. They told Daily Sun they’d lost patience with the Greater Letaba Municipality. They claimed it’s ignoring them and dragging its feet. Matome Makgoba (37) said it takes almost 45 minutes to reach the R81 road, a trip that usually takes less than 10 minutes. “We’re suffering because of this. We’re always late for appointments,” he said. “The dirt roads are really bad and need to be fixed urgently.” A taxi owner said his vehicles were getting damaged. “I have to take my vehicles to a mechanic once or twice a week. “If this continues I’m going to lose my business because I spend a lot of money on repairs.” Villagers said they repair the roads when there’s a funeral. “Hearses find it difficult to drive through when they have to collect or deliver a corpse,” said Mpho Malefo (29). “Our local municipality has turned its back on us. We don’t know where to turn to.” Municipal spokeswoman Lovers Mainetje said a programme aimed at addressing damage on dirt roads after the heavy rainfall was developed. “Sekgopo Village is on the programme,” said Mainetje. “Villagers must liaise with their ward councillors so they can prioritise the important roads as there’s greater damage in many areas.”
