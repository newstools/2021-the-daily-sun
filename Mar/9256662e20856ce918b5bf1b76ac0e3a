BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic chairman Max Tshabalala and chief executive Khumbulani Konco have smoked the peace pipe.Tshabalala suspended Konco last week following a telephonic brawl which has been explained as a "small misunderstanding". According to our sources, Konco put his foot down on Tshabalala who shouted at him and the CEO retaliated, which led to the big boss exercising his power and suspended him. On Tuesday the two had a meeting where Konco and Tshalalala shook hands and put the matter to rest without going through the disciplinary processes. Now Konco has a challenge to deal with the outstanding staff salaries from Wednesday when he returns to office, who have threatened to approach the CCMA and Labour Courts to help fight their long standing salary battles. Club spokesman Sello Nduna confirmed that Konco is now back in office after meeting with chairman.  "The two met and had a discussion and ironed out their misunderstanding," said Nduna. Celtic on Wednesday have a DStv Premiership date against Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium at 5pm.
