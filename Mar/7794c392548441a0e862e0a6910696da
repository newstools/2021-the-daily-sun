Queen Mantfombi is the mother of prince MisuZulu, and according to insiders he is the one in line next for the throne. Insiders also told Daily Sun that the appointment of Queen Mantfombi was revealed during King Zwelithini's will read that was held last week Thursday at the KwaKhethomthandayo royal palace right just after the memorial service. Queen Mantfombi is the daughter of late King Mswati II and the sister of the current Swatini king, King Mswati III. The insiders further revealed that Queen Mantfombi who is also known as  the great wife was appointed because among King Zwelithini wives she is the only who has royal blood and the king's successor will come from her. “Lobola for Mantfombi was paid by the Zulu nation because she is from the eSwatini royal house. Even back then the king always came from the queen who has royal blood and her lobola was paid by the nation. “She has eight princes but as per Zulu culture the first one who is MisuZulu will be the next king that why king Zwelithini appointed her to be interim while she is preparing her son," said the mole.
