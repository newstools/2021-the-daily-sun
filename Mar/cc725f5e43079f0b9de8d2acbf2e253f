LOSING weight is great for one’s self-esteem. It boosts your confidence and, like singer Lira puts it, losing weight “makes you feel good every day”. While losing weight can build your muscles, health experts agree that it can also grow your 4-5. According to Cosmopolitan magazine, as men lose fat around the base of their 4-5, the apparent length increases significantly – about 2cm for every 35 pounds (about 16kg) lost. According sex expert Dr James Elist, losing weight can help visually increase the size of your 4-5. The relationship between weight loss and 4-5 size comes down to the amount of fat in your suprapubic area. The less fat surrounding your 4-5, the bigger it will look, and the more length you can effectively use during intercourse. The catch of the relationship between weight loss and 4-5 size is your current weight. While 4-5 size by race is what people think has the most difference, it’s actually the size by weight. Dr Elist further explains that if you’re obese, you might suffer from buried penis syndrome. This causes the 4-5 to be buried or hidden under your suprapubic fat pad. After you lose that weight, your genitals have the space they need to fully show themselves. Your 4-5 and testicles will look larger. This will give you a psychological boost in the bedroom.
