Exercising can be a very stimulating activity. From working your entire anatomy to the pulsating sweat you endure from your session, working out literally takes a lot out of you. Speaking of working out, according to recent research women can have an orgasm during their workout. Researchers and fitness enthusiasts have known about coregasms for a long time. The first authoritative study on the exercise-induced orgasm was published in 2012 in The Journal of Sexual and Relationship Therapy. Exercise-induced orgasms are a real thing, and about 10% of women have reported experiencing a coregasm at some point in their life. Certain exercises are more likely to trigger them, particularly ones that stress abnormal muscles like hanging leg raises or pull-ups. Doing cardio beforehand increases the odds of a coregasm. In one case, a woman reported having consistent orgasms from doing pull-ups after her eighth or ninth rep. So the next time sheâ€™s wet down there, it just might be more than her sweating from her workout.
