MPUMALANGA police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma has applauded cops for busting one of their own. On Wednesday, 24 March, a 55-year-old warrant officer was arrested for fraud. Zuma said the suspect, who works at the vehicle crime investigation unit, allegedly authorised the clearance of a stolen Toyota RAV4 that formed part of the evidence of a hijacking incident that occurred in March 2020 in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. “He allegedly went ahead and made it possible for the vehicle to be registered fraudulently,” he said. Investigators were probing whether the officer was involved in similar criminal activities in the past. “This must be a warning to SAPS members. We cannot allow anyone to dent our image by being involved in criminal activities. The law must take its course,” he said. The officer is due to appear before the White River Magistrates Court soon.
