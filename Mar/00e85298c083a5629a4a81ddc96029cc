Junior Khanye Khanye burst onto the scene and created huge expectations thanks to his ability. But he never lived up to them as he became overwhelmed by fame leading to a number of issues off the field.His career was ultimately destroyed by alcohol. Thabiso 'Skapie' Malatsi He was one of the bad boys of Daveyton. Malatsi, along with his buddies Jabu Mahlangu and Junior Khanye, used to terrorize defenders as well as their club’s PR team. Although he was extremely skilful and talented on the field of play, Malatsi is still remembered for his off-field antics which destroyed his career. Masibusane Zongo Zongo was one of the most talented dribbling wizards in the PSL. But he never really reached the heights he could have because of his ill-discipline.He became addicted to alcohol and was constantly in and out of rehab.
