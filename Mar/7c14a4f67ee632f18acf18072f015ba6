THE number of incidents of police brutality against black people should be questioned. Cops continue to dismally fail to control large crowds. We have witnessed incidents that blatantly displayed police incompetence in crowd control, and resulted in clashes between them and the protesters. In some instances, innocent lives were lost. Yesterday, a man was shot in cold blood during a protest. Another concerning fail by police is that their brutal actions are in most, if not all cases, directed at black people. This is validated by the fact that it is always black people who lose their lives. Months ago, white farmers stormed the court in the Free State and fired shots. They proceeded to overturn a police vehicle and no crowd control strategies were deployed. No rubber bullet was fired. Again, white farmers blocked the N1 during a protest against farm killings. No bullet was fired. If this is how they were trained to control crowds,then it is time to review the curriculum before blacks fight back. This must stop! - Letter by Dineo Rasekhula
