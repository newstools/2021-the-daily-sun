A GRAPHIC video of a man who is alleged to be mentally unfit has gone viral on social media. In the video, the man can be seen walking naked while screaming ‘I want my money!’ inside a mall. The man then enters a bank, where he is repeatedly beaten with plastic security knobkerries. He is seen struck everywhere around his naked body, with some people chanting: ‘beat him’ while others say the opposite, mentioning that he is mentally unfit. Social media was abuzz with comments, with others saying the security guards were in the wrong for beating him up without understanding what was happening. “They could have just restrained him with handcuffs. Not beat him up like an African dog that has eaten family meat meant for lunch.” Tumediso Kewakae said: “I pray it’s Given Carter (a comedian) because he won’t mind the beating as it comes with his pranks. If the man is mentally challenged, then the guys are in hot soup. But we should know that theft is on the rise and thieves are developing new trends to get away with cash from banks and big companies.” Glory Jay said: “Hayi, if ke prank then Given Carter a chekiwe or something.”
