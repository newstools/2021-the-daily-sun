BAROKA FC midfielder Gerald Phiri says he will do anything he can to help his side avoid relegation from the DStv Premiership. Since the club made their debut in the Premier Soccer League in the 2016-17 season, they have never finished in the top 12 teams. For the past four seasons, they have been flirting with relegation. In their first season, they retained their Premiership status in the promotion/relegation play-offs. Currently, they are 11th with 22 points after 20 matches. On Saturday Phiri, took a bold decision when he became the goalkeeper for the last 20 minutes of their 1-1 draw against Bloemfontein Celtic after keeper Elvis Chipezeze was sent off for violent conduct. Phiri replaced Chipezeze in the goal and did not concede and they managed to snatch a  point when Richard Mbulu scored a late equaliser. The Malawian midfielder said: “I was very nervous. I have never played as a goalkeeper in an official match, but, at training, I am always fooling around. It is something that I have been doing. “Anything for the team, you know where we were last season. When I was going in there (to be the goalkeeper) Masuluke (Oscarine) told me not to be nervous and yah we managed to get a point.” “There was a free-kick, and you know some players are good with free-kicks but the defence was there to help me. The guys did well. I only made one or two saves in those 20 minutes.”
