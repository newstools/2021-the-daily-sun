AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy admitted he was disappointed after his team defeated SuperSport United 1-0 in a DStv Premiership match on Tuesday. Siphelele Mthembu scored the only goal of the match, which saw Usuthu’s impressive display continues in the league as they have now collected 16 points in the last six games, which is a remarkable turnaround since McCarthy’s arrival. McCarthy has lamented a lack of killer instinct in front of goal. “I’m absolutely delighted for the boys. They always work hard, and they give me everything they have got, so I have to be very appreciative of that,” McCarthy said after the match. “My only disappointment is we did not score more than one goal, and that left us with some pressure to soak up towards the end, but we managed it well.” After 18 matches, Usuthu are in sixth position after collecting 28 points. “I am delighted with the three points and the fact that we keep making our mark in this league,” McCarthy added. “The players keep getting better and we are showing that we are a sleeping giant that is slowly waking up.”
