UNDER-PERFORMING Kaizer Chiefs are set for talks with the club management. Amakhosi returned from Burkina Faso on Monday leaking their wounds after they were slain 4-0 by Wydad Athletic in their Caf Champions League fixture at the weekend. But as embarrassing as the result was, it is but one of the many poor results suffered by the team, which has been crashing from one poor result to another. Amakhosi are winless in seven matches, having gone the month of February without a single win. Their league campaign is in shambles and they are not safe bets to go through to the knockout stages in the Champions League, on the evidence of their performances so far. According to a source close to the club, the latest result is a major cause for concern for the team. “The team’s poor form has remained a source of concern for the club and it is not hard to figure out why. The loss to Wydad has highlighted a much bigger challenge for the club,” said the source. “But the meeting is not about finger-pointing or anything of that sort. “It is to highlight the concerns management has and to find a way past the poor run. Remember there is the Fifa transfer ban issue which has disadvantaged the team. “However, the senior players are under pressure to raise their hands and help lead the team out of the current situation. They have been encouraged to raise their concerns if there are any.” The mole also added the club have already put several players on their radar, with Hunt leading the identification process. He has already notified the club about the players he intends to recruit, post the transfer ban. “No less than eight players will be shown the door at the end of the season. And there is already a growing talk about who will be leaving. “Plans for the new season are already underway and the coach has the support of the club,” the source added.
