PATRICK Mofokeng has scored a new role. The actor, best known for playing Mlungisi Ngema on e.tv’s Scandal!, has joined 1Magic’s new telenovela Lingashoni. Speaking to Daily Sun, Patrick said: “When I got the call back, I had forgotten I had even auditioned as they took so long to respond. “More than anything, I was ecstatic because I’ve been looking for a change and a new challenge.” Patrick described his character Mandla as a kind family man. “He is a businessman, politician and entrepreneur who goes through a very traumatic experience that changes his life completely but he later returns to his former life after a decade of memory loss,” he said. “He is a family man who will go to any lengths to protect his family. He will fight tooth and nail for them. “I believe that’s where I connect with him because I love my family very much. “I believe viewers will start to hate him when he goes out for revenge after discovering the things that happened to him.” The Safta-winning actor said bringing Mandla to life was not a challenge. “The only challenge I had was when we began shooting. I was in three productions and it was not easy to juggle them all,” he said. Patrick said the telenovela was unique as it dealt with current issues. “It touches on corruption, nepotism, family values, love and social issues many of us are facing,” he said. The actor said he chose to resign from his job at Scandal!. “When I told them I was leaving, it was the most difficult meeting I had ever had because there were tears in the boardroom, but I’m happy with my decision because I needed growth and change.” Lingashoni will premiere on 22 March on 1Magic on DStv channel 103.
