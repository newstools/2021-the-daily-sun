Parents and pupils can finally breathe a sigh of relief after the North West government kept its promise and delivered a scholar transport pupils have been begging for. The pupils from Slagboom and Mmukubyane villages were forced to walk over eight kilometres to get to school. The pupils had to walk in the bushes, which led to a 13-year-old grade nine pupil being raped and her two of her friends robbed. Daily Sun published their story on the 26 February, headlined: “Pupil raped on way home.” After the rape incident last Monday, the residents closed down three schools and demanded the government provide them with scholar transport. Thanks to SunPower, pupils were provided with buses on Monday, 1 March. The residents said they were happy the government had fulfilled its promise. They said they were only saddened it took a child being raped before they could deliver services. The parents said they were happy that at least their children will be able to continue with their lessons. They said when they closed down the schools it was not to disrupt their lessons, but for their safety. The mother of the 13-year-old girl said she was relieved there won’t be any other child who will go through what her daughter went through. She said her child has gone back to school because she didn’t want to fall back on her studies. “When she heard there are buses, she told me she was ready to go to school. It has been difficult for her,” she said. According to Lesiba Monkwe, who is the departmental deputy director in the MEC’s office, said the reason the transport was halted was because the service provider terminated his contract with them after some enquiries from them. “The service provider was escalating travelling kilos with 74 kilos a day, and when the department wanted to pay him according to the actual kilos, he then terminated the contract,” he said. He urged school principals to alert the department concerning any emerging challenges with regard to the scholar transport.
