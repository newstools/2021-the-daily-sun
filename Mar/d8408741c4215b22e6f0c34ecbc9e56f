Her work is inspired by the recent mass shooting that occurred in Boulder last Monday, 22 March and claimed 10 lives. “It feels like it’s more important now to create a space where people can feel emotions. I want the viewer to feel touched, embraced and held. It’s a way of connecting with people in ways when words are not enough," said Precious about her work. The talented creative said her work is inspired by where she comes from, South Africa. “I am influenced by where I am from. My mentality is not of a minority, my mentality is of an African-majority. Just from being from South Africa, I have an international perspective on global issues and that is how I approach my art, I am excited that the museum is opening up. It’s an opportunity to have a voice in a community where I am a minority. I know Boulder will be able to connect to the work," she said. Precious' exhibition will be available on the Boulder Arts Week website.
