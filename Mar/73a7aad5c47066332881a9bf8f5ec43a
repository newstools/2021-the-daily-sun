TWO Limpopo men are now millionaires after they won Powerball jackpots. The first winner (30) won R51 million on 2 March, while the second winner walked away with R43 million on 5 March. While claiming his winnings, the second winner told the National Lottery operator, Ithuba he bought the winning lottery ticket on the Nedbank banking App. He used a QuickPick selection method. The father of three said he planned to involve his family in his new fortune. “I want to enjoy my winnings with my family. My father and I have a business and some of the money will go towards expanding and growing the company. This will also allow me to create jobs in my community,” he said. He said the magnitude of his winnings was beyond what he has ever dreamt of. “This is honestly something I never expected. As a father of three young kids, it’s important to me for my children to get the best education. “I will save a portion of my winnings to give them the opportunity to go university and make their dreams become a reality,” he said. Ithuba Group CEO, Charmaine Mabuza, said Ithuba’s partnerships with banks yielded positive results. “Since 2015, over R1,3 billion in winnings has been paid to banking channel winners. Our innovation as Ithuba is always motivated by our players. “We want to offer players as much convenience as possible. The partnership with banks provides our players with the convenience of playing Lottery games from anywhere, anytime on trusted platforms of their choice,” said Mabuza. She said Ithuba offered counselling and extensive financial advice to anyone who wins R50 000 and higher. The winning numbers from that draw were: 10, 12,21,27,43 and the PowerBall Plus 15.
