IT IS no secret that Gavin Hunt has not done well since he arrived at Kaizer Chiefs. Since he succeeded Ernst Middendorp at the start of the season, Hunt has endured one of the worst campaigns of his coaching careers.. In a virtual press conference ahead of their Caf Champions League fixture against Petró de Luanda, Hunt lamented inconsistency in team selection. Amakhosi are in position 10 in the league with four wins after 17 games. They started their first-ever Champions League group stage with an unsatisfactory result. On Saturday evening (6pm), they will be hoping for the first win against Petro at FNB Stadium. They were held to a 0-0 by Horoya in their first match and that was followed by a heavy 4-0 defeat at the hands of  Wydad Athletic. "Well, the biggest problem we have had‚ certainly‚ has been in consistency in the selection of the team," Hunt told the reporters. "That has been something that's been out of my hands. Every game, there has been a problem... a change here and change there. And I feel like it will be like that tomorrow (Saturday). Chiefs will be without Samir Nurkovic, Leonardo Castro, Itumeleng Khune, and Kgotso Moleko, to mention a few. Hunt added: "The conceding of goals has been a major problem. We haven't had a settled defence for ages. But we have to be better. There's no doubt about it‚ we've made some huge errors‚ and we have got to be better." If Chiefs fail to get three points in their Caf Group C match against the Angola outfit, they will equal their longest winless streak of nine matches in all competitions since 1996.
