THE absence of Thamsanqa Gabuza and Bradley Grobler was one of the factors that led to a frustrating draw for SuperSport United against TS Galaxy on Friday evening. United coach Kaitano Tembo admitted they had been relying heavily on the duo for goals. Matsatsantsa a Pitori went into the game without their two best finishers in Grobler and Gabuza, who were nursing injuries. "We lacked experience because if you look, most of our goals have been coming from them (Gabuza and Grobler)," Tembo said. "We have been relying heavily on them. With them missing you could see we didn't really know where the goal was going to come from. But it also boils down to the number of games we've played in a very short space of time. You could see it has been difficult for them," Tembo added. "They probably needed the rest, but we have two weeks until we play Stellenbosch and so we will be able to give the guys a little bit of a break." The result means SuperSport's frustrating run of form continues as they have not won in four games, thus missing a chance of equalling with log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns on points. Matsatsantsa A Pitori will next be in action against Stellenbosch FC at the Danie Craven Stadium in two weeks. Tembo believes the break came at the right time, and they needed the break. He noted: "We have to soldier on. I think we have to try to put this game behind us. Now we have about two to three weeksâ€™ break. That is what we needed for the guys to get recover a little bit of freshness because sometimes we tend to be lethargic. "Since January we haven't had a day of rest, we will try and give them a break before starting preparations for Stellenbosch."
