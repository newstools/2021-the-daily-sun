Singer and songwriter Zahara is in mourning. The talented artist has lost her eldest’s sister Nomonde Mkutukana (45) to a tragic car crash. According to the family, the accident happened around the Mooiplaas area in East London, Eastern Cape. Shortly after the news of the accident, heartbroken Zahara took to Instagram to share a heart felt message. “So yesterday was my last time seeing your face when you were at work yhini Masthathu mntakamama. I can’t even cry because in my heart you’re still alive. Lala Ndebe Nkulu kaTata,” she said. The tragic loss of one of the Mkutukana sisters happened just before the Phendula hitmaker released her much-anticipated fifth studio album which she has been working for years. Nomonde leaves behind her two children, four siblings, and the community of Phumlani Village in the Eastern Cape. Nomonde’s death follows seven years after her brother Mbuyiseli Mkutukana was gunned down in 2014 after being caught in a crossfire between rival gangs in a nearby village. The Mkutukana family said they were grateful for the messages of condolences, but asked for privacy during this time of grief.
