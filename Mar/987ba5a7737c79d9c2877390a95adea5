A YOUNG pupil recently found himself in deep kak. However, the 11-year-old did nothing wrong. He was simply following his principal’s instructions.

He allegedly told the pupil he would give him R200 to get into the pit toilet and get his but only gave him R50 after he did. Petros Majola, director of Khula Community Development Project, said after the principal’s cellphone fell into the pit toilet, he allegedly asked pupils to help take kak out with buckets. When the kak water level was halfway, he asked the pupil to get inside and he was tied with a rope. “The child had to stir the faeces using his hands,” he said. A toilet is not a bedroom, kitchen or fridge where you pick something up. “The child is an orphan and lives with his grandmother. He’s traumatised by this experience because he’s now a laughing stock. “The child was adamant he did not voluntary go inside the toilet, but was asked.” Majola said they won’t sit back while kids were being treated badly. The principal has been suspended. Education MEC Fundile Gade condemned the incident. He said the principal was served with a suspension letter. “I’ll visit the school and pupil’s family on Thursday to apologise for this terrible and untoward behaviour displayed by the principal,” said Gade. “This behaviour shows lack of respect for our children. We’re really embarrassed by behaviour that seeks to destroy the noble profession of teaching.” Gade said that counselling was being provided to the affected pupil.
