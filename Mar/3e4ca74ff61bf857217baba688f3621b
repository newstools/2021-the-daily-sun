A GRADE 12 pupil and his friend were allegedly killed by a group of men in full police uniform. Mthobisi Zungu and his friend Khulekani Gumede were killed in the Oqaqeni area in Maphumulo, northern KZN on Friday, 5 March, leaving their families with many unanswered questions. Mthobisi’s sister Beki said they were told the men stormed into a relative’s home near the Otimati area where Mthobisi used to live, and demanded he give them a firearm. “They also turned all the houses in the yard upside down looking for this firearm, but didn’t find it. “When they realised their search led nowhere, they then took him to Khulekani’s home, where they demanded he give them a firearm.” Beki said they were told Khulekani brought his firearm out of the safe, but the men allegedly said it was not the one they were looking for. “He had just taken a few steps back to the safe when the men shot him.” Beki said they then turned the gun on Mthobisi and shot him as well. “We heard they then ran on foot. We’re asking ourselves where they got the police uniform from because we suspect they were not the police. Everything they did was suspicious. They walked such a long distance from Otimati to Khulekani’s home on foot. They would have driven there if they were real police,” said Beki. Captain Nqobile Gwala said charges of murder were being investigated by Maphumulo cop shop. “Two men were allegedly shot and killed at Oqaqeni area by unknown suspects. Both victims were declared dead at the scene by paramedics. The matter is still under investigation,” said Gwala.
