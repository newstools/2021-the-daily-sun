THE evidence against EFF leader Julius Malema and EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi was tampered with. This emerged in court as Warrant Officer Jacobus Nicholas Smith of Cyber Crimes Unit took the stand in the Randburg Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 10 March. Smith told the court the first exhibit he got was a CD with footage of the incident. It was sealed in a forensic bag. “The request was that the charge was assault and I must compile a photo album.” He said there were 23 images on the album and he extracted 39 images from the USB. However, the number of images that were presented in court was much lower. Defence lawyer Advocate Lawrence Hodes said: “Your album was manipulated. You put in 23 images and we ended up with 11.” Smith could not say where the missing images were, or who removed them from the album. However, he said the video was not tampered with when he received it. Earlier, Charles Seanego’s 42-years of experience as a police officer was questioned as he made some blunders when collecting evidence. Seanego was the investigating officer who was tasked with investigating the high-profile assault case involving Malema and Ndlozi, who are accused of assaulting Lieutenant-Colonel Johannes Venter. He said when he took the CDs with the footage from Deon Klingbeil, he sealed the forensic bag in front of him, but his statement didn’t have that information. Hodes said: “In your statement you didn’t record that you sealed it in front of him. “A constable would know that a seal number and serial number need to be recorded.” Speaking to the media outside court, Malema said the removal of the photos from the album was to try to make them guilty. The trial was postponed to 1 July.
