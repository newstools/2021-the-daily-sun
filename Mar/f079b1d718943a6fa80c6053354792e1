A TAXI driver, passenger,
and truck driver lost their lives in a horrific accident on the R101 road
outside Polokwane in Limpopo. A 22-seater minibus and a
truck collided head-on allegedly when unsafe overtaking took place. Mike Maringa the spokesman
for Transport Department and Community Safety in Limpopo says the preliminary
investigations suggest that fatigue or unsafe overtaking could be the possible
cause of the deadly accident. Maringa said: "A
Scania truck collided head-on with a 22 Seater bus between Polokwane
Weighbridge and The Ranch Hotel. Three people were certified dead on the scene
and two others were rushed to the hospital." "Preliminary
investigations suggest that fatigue or unsafe overtaking could be the possible
cause of the accident. The deceased include drivers of both vehicles and a
female passenger from the bus." He said.
