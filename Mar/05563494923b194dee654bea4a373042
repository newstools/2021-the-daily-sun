UNBEATEN powerful puncher Noxolo Makhanavu is back on her feet again, ready to take on any challengers for her flyweight division belt. This comes after she collapsed a fortnight ago while jogging in East London, Eastern Cape while preparing for the Return of the Big Guns tournament in Secunda, Mpumalanga, organised by Joyce Kungwane’s TLB Boxing Promotions. Makhanavu went back to the gym yesterday as she shakes off the cobwebs after having last fought in 2017, when she knocked out Portia Base to successfully retain her crown. “I’m glad I haven’t been stripped of the title after so many years of been inactive,” said the 36-year-old from Mdantsane. Makhanavu will tomorrow register with Boxing SA (BSA) as a fighter for the 2021-2022 boxing season. “Boxing is still in me and I will fight for as long as I can until I’m crowned world champion one day,” said the boxer, who works in the medical field. Trainer Kholisile Cengani believes Makhanavu is ready to get back to the ring, after the collapsing episode. “Doctors said it was nothing too serious, but just dehydration. “She pushed herself very hard on the road while also still unfit,” said Cengani yesterday. “But I’m glad she’s made a complete recovery and took some time off from training to give her body a break. I’m excited that she will be registering as a boxer again.” Without being in the ring for three years, Makhanavu was ready to quit the sport for good as there were no competitors for her, and worse, the lockdown happened last year. Makhanavu, the unbeaten boxer out of five bouts, was scheduled to make her ring return against fellow hard- punching Smangele Hadebe in the flyweight, but that drawl ended up being dropped to a catchweight where the latter fought against Melissa Miller.
