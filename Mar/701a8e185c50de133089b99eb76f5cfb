IT is a win or bust for DStv Premiership bottom side Maritzburg United! Coach Ernst Middendorp says work starts now for him to rescue the club. The out of sorts Team of Choice crashed out of the Nedbank Cup last-16 at the hands of Orlando Pirates’ 3-1 at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday. Middendorp, who rescued Maritzburg’s Premiership status in the 2015-16 season, added the match against Lidoda Duvha at Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow (5pm) is crucial as they have not won in their last six league games. However, they face a Lidoda Duvha side that will be looking to complete the hat-trick of wins over Kwa-Zulu Natal sides after beating two clubs from the same province in the space of less than a week. They beat Golden Arrows 2-1 in a league match before edging AmaZulu 1-0 in the Nedbank Cup last-16 at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. Leopards also defeated Maritzburg in the first round of the league. “Our business starts on Tuesday (tomorrow) when we start the second half of the season,” said Middendorp. Failure to win this game could see Middendorp’s days at the club numbered. The German continued: “We said after finishing the first half of the season with a defeat against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila here on 12 February, it was important to release other players and bring others in, who we think have the right mentality to fight the battle of staying in the league.” Middendorp had a busy transfer window to bolster his team. He signed Travis Graham, German-born goalkeeper Marcel Engelhardt, Keletso Sifama on loan from Kaizer Chiefs, Serbian striker Dusan Stevic who was a free agent and recently added versatile player in Ryan Rae. He also promoted few players from the DStv Diski Challenge team. He surprisingly parted ways with Keagan Buchanan and Pogiso Sanoka. “We hope we are able to start the second half of the season with a certain intensity to get results,” added Middendorp.
