THE Department of Education has welcomed the sentencing of a 17-year-old pupil from Mathole High School in Mahlabathini, northern KZN. The pupil was filmed while assaulting another pupil in September last year. A 29-second video of the bullying was circulated on various social media platforms. The three-month sentence comes after she failed to give the magistrate valid reasons for not showing up in court on 23 February. Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu welcomed the sentencing. “We’re pleased with the manner in which law enforcement agencies have dealt with the matter,” said Mshengu. He said the department had a number of bullying cases. “Despite campaigns to plead with pupils to stop this behaviour, it appears some continue to disregard our call,” said Mshengu. “We hope this sentence and likelihood of another one for assault will serve as a harsh lesson to all other badly behaved pupils.” The victim’s parents opened a case at a local police station in Mahlabathini, where  the pupil was charged with assault. After appearing in court last September, the underage suspect was released on warning and placed under the care of her mum. She was expected to appear in court on 23 February but didn’t show up. Her mum said she didn’t know where she was. The magistrate postponed the matter to 9 March to establish reasons for her non-attendance. She failed to provide valid reasons. She was found guilty of contempt of court and sentenced to three months imprisonment. She’s expected to appear again on 31 March when the assault case will once again be heard.
