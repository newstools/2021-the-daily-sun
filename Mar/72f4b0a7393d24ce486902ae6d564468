KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has confirmed four senior players that will missÂ  Sunday's Soweto derby clash against Orlando Pirates. The highly anticipated match between the two clubs, which will be their 100 meeting, will take place at FNB Stadium in Soweto (3 pm). Hunt revealed in a virtual press conference that Leonardo Castro, Itumeleng Khune, and Khama Billiat would miss the encounter on Thursday. Billiat and Castro are out with injuries while Khune is out due to the Covid-19 protocols after attending her sister's funeral the past weekend. "Yeah, Khune is not available. He's still going through all the Covid-19 protocols of when you come back after obviously having been at a funeral and that, so he won't be available," Hunt said. Lebogang Manyama is another player that will miss the game due to suspension. Hunt added: "Castro won't be back; Khama is obviously still out; Lebo Manyama is suspended. And we have one or two other little problems, which hopefully will come right by Sunday. "Since his arrival at Chiefs, Hunt is yet to win a match against Pirates. Without a doubt, he is desperate to get all the points when these two meets on Sunday. "I don't think I have ever lost to Pirates three times in my life. It's disappointing, but we have to look forward and we have to correct these mistakes," he stated. Amakhosi are without a league victory in their last six matches. They had to fight back to hold Maritzburg United to a 1-1 draw in their last league game early this month.
