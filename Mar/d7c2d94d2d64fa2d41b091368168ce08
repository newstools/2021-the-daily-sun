It’s disappointing and unfortunate that police can’t crowd-control student gatherings and opt to respond with bullets. Someone died as a result of police negligence. Remember what happened at Marikana? Remember the brutal killing of Andries Tatane? There was no need to shoot at the Wits students on Wednesday! They were protesting against financial exclusion after being ignored by government leaders and varsity management? Police need training in proper handling of peaceful protests. A minister, premier or MEC should’ve intervened and listened to the students’ concerns. Now that a man has died, suddenly leaders are paying attention. - Letter by Norman Maake, Tembisa
