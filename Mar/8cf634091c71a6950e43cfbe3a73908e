GHANA FA president Kurt Okraku has issued a mandate to his national team players beat Bafana Bafana in Thursday's (6pm) penultimate Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers at FNB Stadium. Ghana and Bafana are joint leaders of Group C with nine points each from four games and Okraku said they must complete the job by beating Bafana to make things easy going into their last Afcon qualifying match against pointless Sao Tome. The Black Stars are without captain and Swansea City forward Andre Ayew and his brother, Jordan of Crystal Palace, vice-captain and Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey as they didn’t travel as Mzansi is listed by the United Kingdom (UK) as a Covid-19 hotspot. However, the trio are set to be in the starting line-up when the Black Stars host bottom side Sao Tome in Cape Coast Stadium on Sunday. Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Richard Ofori will also miss this game as he’s injured. Ofori missed the Soweto derby against Kaizer Chiefs last Sunday. The country will be led by Mubarak Wakaso, who is the stand-in captain. But Okraku, despite being minus his big stars, wants maximum points.  “From the two games, we have to qualify. The qualification has to start from the first game in South Africa,” said Okraku. “For the past four weeks (Ghana called up local based players initially for the camp), we have been preparing for this important two assignment. When we march out of the tunnel to face Bafana Bafana, we all have one thing in mind - qualification.” However, Ghana have not had good results when they faced Bafana in their last four visits to South Africa. They have won only once, lost two and drawn the other one. The win was a 2-0  victory in June 2005 in a 2006 Fifa World Cup qualifier. Ghana also face a Bafana side that has not lost in a competitive game at home since losing to Senegal in the November 2017 in a 2018 World Cup qualifiers in Limpopo. But added Okraku: “We wholly believe in the quality of the technical team we have.”
