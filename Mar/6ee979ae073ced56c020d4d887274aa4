MORE politicians, kings and union leaders paid their last respects to late Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini yesterday. Among those who visited the KwaKhethomthandayo Royal Palace in Nongoma, northern KZN, were ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule and the EFF top six led by Julius Malema. The country’s deputy president David Mabuza, Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa, and Bakoena ba Mopeli king Moremoholo Mopeli also visited. Malema, whose party gave two cows to the royal house, said: “The death of our father shouldn’t serve as a source of divisions. Many kingdoms were undermined through divisions and we don’t want to see those division happening to the Zulu monarchy. “Anyone who fights for black people is a friend of the EFF. He had many interventions that stopped political wars in Natal. He was not only the king of the Zulu people but the king of us all,” he said. Magashule said: “The king always had one message for us as the ANC: he used to tell us the ANC must unite because it’s a glorious movement for the people of South Africa.” Mabuza described the king as joyous.  “He was a straightforward person. If he didn’t want something he would say so. He was a good leader,” he said. Mathunjwa said the king was often concerned about the exploitation of migrant mineworkers. “I still remember when we met him in Joburg. He said I still needed to do more to fight for workers. He was vocal about worker exploitation, regardless of the tribes,” he said. Royal house spokesman Prince Thulani said mourners would only be allowed into the palace after Wednesday, 17 March when the king’s body arrived. “We will perform private rituals and protocols. I can’t give details, but from Thursday mourners are free to come,” he said.
