WE are
living in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where everything has been
integrated into technology. Technological
advancements of the past five years 
indicate that many industries will seize to exist should they fail to
step into this new revolution. Take the
sex workers industry as an example. While many are known to be ladies and
gentlemen of the night or night city mayors, the magoshas are about to add some
pink into their industry. According
to global statistics, there are over 40 million sex workers in the world.
Despite being such a big industry, with so many people directly and indirectly
linked to it, the attitude and behaviour of society towards the industry is
very regressive and primitive. This has resulted in sex workers always being
deprived of basic rights such as safety. This was
the insight used to develop Pink – a mobile app for sex workers (primarily for
females). It’s a
solution that targets to resolve many of the problems that sex workers face in
their daily lives. The primary goal is to assist in educating and protecting
them while at work. As many
would know, sex workers are socially and economically excluded. Pink, through
its global network, also provides opportunities in matters such as health and
access to education. With the
global pandemic affecting the productivity of this industry, the app took this
time to empower and grow the over 600 000 sex workers on its platform, with
many users based in India. I have no
doubt that this app has the right spices to succeed and grow the sex work
industry.
