Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has extended the validity of visas which expired during lockdown to 30 June for short-term visas and 31 July for long-term visas. Motsoaledi issued the directions in line with the National State of Disaster Regulations. “This means visas that were lawfully issued and expired during the period of lockdown are deemed to be valid until the end of June and 31 July this year.” He said holders of such visas are permitted to remain in the country under the conditions of their visas until the expiry of their applicable extension. “Those wishing to be repatriated to their countries within this period can depart without being declared undesirable persons. “However, the extension doesn’t apply to people who entered the country from 15 March 2021. The normal validity period of visas of people admitted into the country from 15 March 2021 applies,” he said. He said Refugee Reception Centres remain closed. “The validity of asylum and refugee permits has been extended until 30 June 2021. “In due course, the department will communicate details of an online service to renew these permits,” said Motsoaledi. On the other hand, holders of longer-term temporary visas such as study visa, treaty visa, business visa, medical treatment visa, relatives’ visas, general work visa, critical skills work visa, retired person’s visa and exchange visa, which expired during the State of National Disaster are invited to renew their visas at www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica before 31 July 2021.
