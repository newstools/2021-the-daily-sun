LAWRENCE “Bhobhoza” Tshwenu and Siyabonga Mabila were close friends and did everything together. The friends died together when they drowned at Mountain View in Kopanong, Tshwane. They drowned on Saturday, 27 February. Bhobhoza’s mum Madeline (24) said it was difficult to forget the five-year-old’s last words. “He promised to buy me a house and car,” she said. “He said I was suffering and people in the area were also suffering as they live in shacks.” She said her son wanted to improve people’s lives. “He was a loving child who always made everyone happy. I’m heartbroken,” she said. Siyabonga’s mum Pretty (38) said the company that digs up sand in the area was to blame as there was no fence and guards. “I’m heartbroken. I need answers and I know nothing will replace my boy,” she said. Community leader, William Makhari (63), said: “We’re tired of companies that dig up sand and leave open spaces that become dams during the rainy season.” Roads and Infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo told Daily Sun: “We’ll appoint senior counsel to conduct a proper investigation which will give us facts, information and answers. “We want to be open and transparent and make sure all factors are investigated. “We’ll attend to it where it’s found that appointed service providers and contractors were negligent.”
