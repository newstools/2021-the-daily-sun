THE mystery behind actress Noxolo “Noxee” Maqashalala’s death has been solved. Her family got the post mortem results, which revealed that the Diamond City actress died of natural causes. Noxee was found dead in her home in Honeydew, north of Joburg on Friday, 12 March. It was reported that it looked like she had been dead for about a week when her body was found. Family spokesman Pastor Khabo Nyikiza told Daily Sun: “The post mortem revealed that it was a natural death, nothing else.” PRISON POKE INMATE SERVING LIFE FOR RAPE! The family faced backlash for not checking on Noxee for a week. But Nyikiza said there was a reason for that. “When she was working, two weeks would go by without hearing from her because she was usually busy,” he said. But the family became worried when she didn’t answer her phone for a week. “Her brother sent someone to check on her because she wasn’t answering her phone. Unfortunately, they couldn’t enter because the security guard didn’t let them in. Before entering, the security guard must first check with the resident and if the resident doesn’t answer, then the visitor won’t be let in,” he said. Nyikiza said Noxee will be buried in KwaBhaca in the Eastern Cape on Friday, 19 March. Her memorial service will be held at the Market Theatre on Wednesday, 24 March.
