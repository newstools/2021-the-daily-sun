BAROKA coach Thoka Matsimela is a very proud man! Matsimela is bragging after his two youngsters Goodman Mosele and Evidence  "Tower" Makgopa were called up to the South African Under-23 squad for the camp in Durban in preparation for the Tokyo Olympics which starts in July. Mosele and Makgopa have been impressive this season and the duo have made it clear that they are dreaming to playing in the Olympics. Striker Makgopa (20) have scored five goals while Mosele (21) have been instrumental in the midfielder for Bakgaga. “I am so proud of these two youngsters,” said Matsimela. “This is good news for the boys and the club as a whole. This shows that when you give your best at training and in games you will be rewarded. "I am very thankful to (SA U-23) coach David Notoane for giving these youngsters a chance as they are working hard all the time. It is a very player's dream to play for his country. He added: "I believe this is the beginning of good things for these boys and I hope their call up will inspire other youngsters we have in the team. It shows that to play for your country you don't have to play for a so called big team." Matsimela, who is in his debut season as coach in the DStv Premiership says he is keeping his fingers crossed for the duo to make it to Notoane's final squad for the Olympics. “Our goal is to finish in the top eight this season and it will be a cherry on top of the cake if we achieve that and the boys make it to the Olympics,” he explained. “I have no doubt that they can go to the Olympics. All we have to do is to encourage them to stay humble and keep working hard."
