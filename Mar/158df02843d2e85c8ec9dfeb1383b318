WITH South Africa moving down to lockdown level 1, Nehawu hopes it will not make people think they can let their guard down. The union said this was not the time to sit back and relax because the new variant of Covid-19 spreads very easily. “The extension of the hours for the sale of alcohol must not lead to trauma cases which will further put strain on our already overstretched healthcare system,” the union said. “With a third wave expected in the next three months, our government must move with speed in preparing our healthcare system. “As Nehawu, we will continue to monitor all healthcare facilities and check if they have sufficient stocks of quality PPE, functioning health and safety committees and enough space for social distancing. “We note the announcement that more than 67 000 frontline workers have been vaccinated. However, this number is too small considering the first phase was supposed to vaccinate more than 1,5 million workers.” The Southern African Alcohol Policy Alliance SA said it was concerned that the government was moving too quickly too fast. “We urge the cabinet to be proactive and to introduce targeted measures to help reduce the harmful use of alcohol and to protect lives over the next two months, including restricting access to alcohol on high-risk days,” the alliance said. The SunTeam took to the streets to get people’s reactions on the move to level 1. Prince Phuzane from Dlamini, Soweto, said: “I am happy that everything is open, only if people can do social distancing. People should always wear masks. I also hope that people will follow the Covid-19 regulations, because this thing kills.” Sifiso Motaung (24) from Soweto said: “I feel like we are going to go back to level 5. It seems like things were rushed to reach level 1 and in addition, most of the population has not been vaccinated.”
