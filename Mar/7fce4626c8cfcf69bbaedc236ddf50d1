KING Goodwill
Zwelithini's body was expected to arrive at KwaKhethomthandayo Royal Palace in
Nongoma, KZN on the afternoon of Friday, 12 March. This was said by Zulu monarch Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Speaking on Ukhozi FM, Buthelezi said the king's body will lie in state
to let the people pay their respects before the burial. “I want to emphasise that although the Zulu nation is grieving, they
must not forget that the king died amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Even while we
are grieving, we must protect people and follow all Covid-19 regulations. The
Zulu nation can mourn and pay respect to the king by postponing all their
entertainment events until the royal house announces that the nation is free to
have events,” he said. “The funeral
arrangement details will be announced once the Royal House has met to decide,”
Buthelezi said. King Zwelithini died
on Friday, 12 March in hospital where he had been receiving medical care for
high glucose levels. When Daily Sun arrived at KwaKhethomthandayo Royal Palace,
princes were outside the palace mourning together. When asked for comment, they said Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi is the
only one who has authority to comment. President Cyril Ramaphosa mourned the passing of the Zulu king. “This sad news comes at a time when we had all been hopeful that His
Majesty was recovering well in the hospital where he had been over the past few
weeks. “His
Majesty will be remembered as a much-loved, visionary monarch who made an
important contribution to cultural identity, national unity and economic
development in KZN and through this, to the development of our country as a
whole. King
Zwelithini was the longest serving Zulu king, ruling for almost 50 years. King
Zwelithini restored the circumcision culture in 2009 after it was banned by
King Shaka around 200 years ago because of many wars at that time. He also
restored the Reed Dance ceremony and many Zulu cultural festivals and
activities.
