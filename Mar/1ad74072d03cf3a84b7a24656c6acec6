SOWETO-born hip-hop dancer and choreographer Ntando Mabaso is headed to New York to represent Mzansi. But the only thing standing between him and achieving this dream is the funds to get there. He told SunBuzz he’s been dancing for more than 20 years and even has an award to back it up. “Last December, I won at the SATE Awards. I then went on to qualify at the International Arts Talent Showcase to go to New York in July 2022. “But I need funds so I can showcase my talent in September in front of scouts such as the New York Academy, Tyler Perry Studios and America’s Got Talent,” he said.

He said his dream of being a world-renowned dancer/choreographer would be possible if he had the funds. “I’m appealing to those who are able to assist in funding me so I not only represent my country, but I can also do what I love. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Ntando was confident this opportunity would open doors for him. “With this opportunity, I can make it into talent scouting, which would be the beginning of my career. I just need someone to believe in me by investing in my dream,” he said. Ntando is hoping that someone will read his story and help him.
