IT’S BEEN 28 years of waking up with evil hands on her throat, choking her at night. And finding the wet evidence of unwanted sex on her thighs in the morning. NOT EVEN GOING TO THWASA COULD SCARE AWAY HER HATED TOKOLOSHE LOVER! Rosinah Monkge (51) from Soshanguve, Tshwane, told Daily Sun she hasn’t had a proper night’s sleep soon after she moved into her house in Soshanguve, Tshwane, in 1993. “It started happening after about six months,” said Rosinah. “When I went to bed something would come and choke me. I’d feel like I’m losing my breath and pass out.” She said in later years she’d wake up wet. “I always wake up with moisture on my private parts, meaning there was something sleeping with me at night,” she said. She consulted izangoma who told her to go and thwasa, but that made it worse. “I went to thwasa in 2016, and my gobela said my torture would end, but it didn’t,” she said. “It got worse. It was as if I was going out of my way to find bad luck.” Rosinah said she even envies people who sleep peacefully at night. “My life is a mess. Every night this thing has to come to my bed first and when it’s done with me, I try to sleep,” she said. “But I don’t sleep properly because I’m scared it will come back.” She said she can’t keep a man. “Men come into my life and soon go away as if something is scaring them away,” she said. “I’ve been told that this thing has made my body smell badly and has caused bad luck.” She said she’s seen people being helped through the pages of the People’s Paper. “I’m hoping I can be helped, as well,” she said. Rosinah’s friend, Anna Ngobeni (53), said Rosinah has been suffering for years. “This thing is destroying her life,” said Anna. “How can a woman stay without a man yet something is busy trying to be her husband but it doesn’t even come with groceries? “And it wants to choke and kill her. She really needs help.” Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said Rosinah has probably been cursed. “She needs to get a sangoma who will do rituals.”
