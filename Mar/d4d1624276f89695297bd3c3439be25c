ZULU king Goodwill Zwelithini’s praise singer Buzetsheni Mdletshe says he learnt many things about his culture over the five decades of working in the royal house. Speaking about the late king, the 66-year-old told Daily Sun: “We have lost a great leader who was a man of peace. He prioritised royal development.” He said he started volunteering as a praise singer in 1974 when he was only 19, but he was officially hired into the position in 2001. He said he never set foot in a classroom but his skills had seen him win the respect of academics, historians and politicians. Mdletshe said it was an honour to travel with the king and introduce him before his speeches. Mdletshe said his uncle Nogotshwa Mdletshe taught him all the king’s praise names. He first recited the king’s praise publicly in 1974 at the wedding of the his daughter as the official praise singer couldn’t make it.

Mdletshe travelled the world with the king and said his first overseas trip was to Coker College in the US, where the king received an honorary doctorate in law in 1999. He told Daily Sun that the king’s burial protocols were kept a secret. He said the king’s grave was called an idlinza because no one was sure he was buried there.
