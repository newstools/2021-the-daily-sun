Former president FW de Klerk announced, during his 85th
birthday celebration on Thursday, that he had been diagnosed with cancer. In a statement, De Klerk's foundation said he was diagnosed
with mesothelioma, which is a cancer that affects the tissue lining the
lungs. "Mr De Klerk will start a course of immunotherapy next
week. There is no immediate threat and we are confident the treatment will be
successful," said the foundation. In October last year, De Klerk lost his son, Willem, 53, to
cancer. SOURCE: NEWS24
