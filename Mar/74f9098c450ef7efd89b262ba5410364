The unexpected cancellation of the fight was due to the untimely death of King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu at the age of 73.

"South Africans, due to the passing of  Isilo sa Mabandla, King Goodwill Zwelithini, who was very close to me, and I was like a son to him, and he was like a father to me, therefore, we're in mourning as the Zulu nation, so the fight will be postponed until further notice. This is in mourning and respect of Isilo sa Mabandla," said Mnisi on Friday. Among the guests that were expected at the fight night included retired 54-year-old lightweight and super middleweight champion, Dingaan “Rose of Soweto” Thobela.
