MARITZBURG United coach Ernst Middendorp said they should have beaten Kaizer Chiefs on Wednesday considering the number of chances they created. Middendorp’s side could have been out of sight by halftime but they let their visitors off the hook after the break to see this DStv Premiership game end in a 1-1 draw at Harry Gwala Stadium. Maritzburg went ahead when Thabiso Kutumela scored in the 15th minute. Judas Moseamedi saw his shot come off the Amakhosi crossbar in the second half. But United who dominated paid the price when Lebogang Manyama headed home the equaliser in the 89th minute. A disappointed Middendorp said: “I’m not totally happy about it and we should have seen the game out. In the first half, we had higher intensity, pressing them high and scoring the goal and having other clear possibilities to score a second goal. It should have been 2-0 at halftime. “In the second half, we hit the crossbar and we had other counter-attacks because that was our strength. But we should have scored the second goal as that was going to be crucial for us.” Maritzburg, who have picked up five points in three league matches, will have 10 days of rest before their next game. They visit TS Galaxy on 20 March at Mbombela Stadium. Middendorp hopes by then he’ll have Kwanda Mngonyama, new signing Dusan Stevic and Travis Graham back from injuries. Clayton Daniels will be back from suspension. “Hopefully also Kutumela would have fully recovered and Judas, Phumlani Ntshangase, who played 15 minutes (after being )out for four months, will be okay,” added Middendorp. “We need to have better options during games.”
