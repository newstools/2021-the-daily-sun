History clearly favours Kaizer Chiefs when they travel to Luanda to play Angolan side Petro Atletico in their CAF Champions League Group C clash on Tuesday. The AmaKhosi have already sealed a 2-0 home win in the pool, their first ever success at this stage of the competition. South Africa sides have only suffered one defeat to Petro in nine previous meetings across the Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup competitions, and that came 20 years ago in the semifinals. Mamelodi Sundowns claimed a 2-0 home win and then lost by the same scoreline away, but triumphed 5-3 on penalties to advance to the final, where they lost to Al Ahly. But more recently, The Brazilians claimed a 3-0 home win in the 2019-20 pool stages, and then gained a 2-2 draw in Luanda, though Chiefs will be desperate to make to back-to-back wins given their precarious position in the group. SuperSport United are the other Premier Soccer League team to have played Petro, on both occasions in the Confederation Cup. They claimed a 0-0 away draw and then won 2-0 at home in the 2013 season, before again being held scoreless and winning 2-1 at home in 2018. The overall record of South African teams against Petro reads won five, drawn three and lost one. And in terms of all PSL clubs against all Angolan sides, the records is played 24, won 11, draws six and lost seven. Chiefs have already defeated Primeiro de Agosto in the Champions League this season (including a 1-0 away win), while they have special memories of facing Angolan opposition after they beat InterClube in the final of the 2001 CAF Cup Winnersâ€™ Cup to lift the trophy. -SuperSport
