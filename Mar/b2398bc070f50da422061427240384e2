Mpumalanga
police have launched a manhunt for the attackers behind the murder of four
people in the taxi industry. Two of the
victims were killed in the Nkangala District on Monday. The first
shooting occurred at 17:30 when a group of armed attackers in a white VW Golf 7
shot at a 44-year-old man sitting in a minibus taxi at KwaMhlanga Crossroad.
The man, a taxi driver identified as Jeremia Nkosinathi Chabangu, died. The
attackers fled the scene. On Monday
at around 20:40, a 65-year-old man was shot at Boekenhouthoek near
Kwaggafontein when two armed men entered his home and opened fire, police

Piet Mahlangu was fatally wounded and his wife sustained injuries to her leg. Two other
men were killed earlier this month, Hlathi said. Taxi driver
