SEX, like a well-mixed cocktail, has many layers to it – from the foreplay, the physical, to the emotional aspects. Sex is multi-layered, but for today, we will focus on the physical aspect of sex. Besides making one feel good emotionally, sex has an outward benefit – the beauty benefits of sex. According to the Mind Body Green publication, sex can make you feel more beautiful. Here are the five beauty benefits of sex: 1. Sex is good for your skin and hair. According to one study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, having an orgasm increases your body’s levels of estrogen, which contributes to healthy hair and skin. 2. Sex makes you glow Sex makes your heart rate and blood flow increase, and more blood flow means more oxygen flooding your body, which can give you more vibrant, flushed-looking skin. Like Rihanna said, you shine bright like a diamond. 3. Sex makes you look younger One study on over 3 000 men and women found those who had sex three times a week appeared seven to 12 years younger than their actual age. 4. Sex makes your breasts look bigger According to internist Michael Roizen, breasts can swell up to 25% during sex. 5. Orgasms flatten your belly Having increased cortisol in your system contributes to that mkhaba around your belly. Oxytocin, which is the hormone you release while having an orgasm, lowers your cortisol and can shed 5-10 pounds off your belly.
