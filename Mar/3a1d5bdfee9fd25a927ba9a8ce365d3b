BAFANA Bafana striker Lyle Foster is hoping to make a huge impact with the senior national team. The 20-year-old is one of a few players to have represented his country from Under-17 level to Bafana Bafana. Foster, who now plies his trade in Portugal for Vitória Guimaraes, is delighted with the progress he has made in his international career. The striker is determined to make the most of his opportunity with Bafana who are hoping to seal qualification for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) on Thursday (6pm) when they lock horns against Ghana at FNB Stadium. Foster is hoping to get a run in Molefi Ntseki’s side after injuries ruled out fellow strikers Bradley Grobler and Kermit Erasmus. Foster might not be getting as much game time in Portugal but he insists he is fit and raring to go for Bafana. “The injuries are unfortunate but it is an opportunity for someone else to show what they can do,” said Foster. “You do feel sorry for the players who miss due to injuries because everyone wants to represent their country but that’s just the nature of football. “We don’t come to the camp hoping someone gets injured so you can play, you come hoping you can do well and earn your spot. “That’s been my mindset since I have been here. I am new in the team so I just want to do my best to help the team achieve our goals.”
