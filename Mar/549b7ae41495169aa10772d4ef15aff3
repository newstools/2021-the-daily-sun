AT least 121 cattle, 57 goats and 111 sheep were recovered during a police operation in Mthatha between 19 February and Tuesday, 9 March. The operation, according to police spokesman Khaya Tonjeni, was supported by provincial and King Sabata Dalindyebo traffic services as a direct response to the rise in stock theft-ridden places. These included Bityi, Mthatha, Mount Frere, Libode, Sulenkama, Lusikisiki, Flagstaff and Tsolo. “The operation is targeted at combating stock theft, proliferation of illegal weapons and general crime. Its impact is expected to reach OR Tambo, Joe Gqabi and Chris Hani districts,” said Tonjeni. Following the operation, 40 suspects, aged between 21 and 58, were arrested and charged for possession of suspected stolen stock and possession and dealing in drugs. During the three-week operation, six firearms, 47 ammunition, 37 knives and five cellphone were recovered. Part of the operation included issuing 30 traffic fines amounting to R30 600 for different offences. Tonjeni said 12 awareness campaigns were conducted during this operation, where one unlicensed liquor outlet was closed. About R240 000 worth of drugs were confiscated in the district namely crystal meth, dagga, whoonga and mandrax. Eastern provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga commended members for the breakthrough, and affirmed the public that “police will do their best to fight stock theft in the province”. She encouraged the public to support this initiative by giving cops valuable information.
