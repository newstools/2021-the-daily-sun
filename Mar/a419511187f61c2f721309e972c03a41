BAFANA Bafana could be without midfielder Keagan Dolly for their vital Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan later this month. This comes after Fifa instituted a rule for European clubs that says they can withdraw players for international duty in this March window due to fears around the Covid-19 pandemic. On Wednesday, French clubs voted unanimously not to allow foreign players from outside the European Union to travel to their home countries to avoid possible quarantine on their return. They decided that they will enforce that ruling, a decision made easier for them by the postponement of World Cup qualifiers in South America. "In the absence of an exemption from quarantine for foreign international players made available to their national team. Clubs will not make foreign players called up for matches outside the EU/EEA zone available to their national teams during the next international period in March," said the French football league statement. This means Bafana will have to do without Dolly, who is playing in the Ligue 1 for Montpellier. Dolly is the only French-based player who was called in the squad as Lebo Mothiba, and Lebogang Phiri are out due to injuries. Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki will now be hoping that clubs in Portugal, England, and Scotland do not follow suit, resulting in more overseas players such as Bongani Zungu, Percy Tau, and Luther Singh not being allowed. Ghana, who will play Bafana in one of the two matches, has four players playing in Ghana. They have defenders John Boye (Metz), Nicholas Opoku (Amiens), and Alexander Djiku (Strasbourg), as well as midfielder Emmanuel Lomotey (Amiens).
