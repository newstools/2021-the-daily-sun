IT is widely known around Africa that most football players struggle financially after their retirement age, which leaves them living a paupers life when their millions of Rands are over. The leading cause is that most of them tend to focus only on football to manage their fancy lifestyle while still playing. They do not plan for life beyond their football careers. They end up with nothing to fall back on once their career is over. To avoid falling on hard times in future, Bafana Bafana striker Dino Ndlovu is not only living a lavish lifestyle, but he already kicked off plans for life beyond his professional career. Ndlovu, currently playing for Chinese side Zhejiang Greentown FC in Asia, has launched a sumptuous Legacy Lifestyle Lounge in Mpumalanga. “I opened the Legacy Lifestyle Lounge last weekend, together with George Lebese,” Ndlovu told SunSport. Ndlovu is also “securing the bag” with a lucrative Real Estate business in his hometown of Klerksdorp. “Of course, the property business is something that I’ve also been working on for the past five years now. It's one of the business ventures I'm working on.” The 31-year-old is also the Casa De Lavilla Guest House owner, which is situated at 17 Dawill Street, Wilkoppies, Klerksdorp. He revealed: “I have townhouses and small complexes in my hometown (Klerksdorp) and I’m busy on the market trying to get a few others. “I am also building townhouses at the moment back at home, but the Covid-19 pandemic just got everything going slowly. However, I'm optimistic about the future. I'm planning for life beyond football.”
