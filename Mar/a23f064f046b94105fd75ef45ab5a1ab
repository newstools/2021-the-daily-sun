One person was trapped in the car after the crash. The blue BMW convertible was involved in a crash
that led to the car going down a cliff on N2 In KwaZulu Natal. IPSS Medical Rescues Search and paramedics worked
to stabilize the trapped person from the wrecked vehicle. According to IPSS Medical Rescues, witnesses allege
that two cars had been traveling at high speeds and interchanging lanes on the
N2 Northbound when one of the cars lost control just after the Croc Farm. This caused it to leave the roadway and roll
multiple times.  “An IPSS Medical Rescue unit was in proximity and
arrived on the scene in less than a minute and began stabilizing patients
whilst awaiting further units. Rescue tools were used to access and free the
entrapped patient.”  The critical patient, along with a moderately
injured passenger and one minor injured person were transported by paramedics
to Mediclinic Victoria Hospital.
