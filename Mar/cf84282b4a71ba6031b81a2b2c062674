A DRUNK mum punched her e-hailing service driver in the head in a car travelling at over 100mk/h. This after he refused to spend the night with her. The incident happened when Emma Louise Cope was being taken home last year on 16 September in Australia. During the ride, she climbed from the back of the car into the front seat next to the driver. When the driver declined her advances, the 42-year-old punched him in the head. He pulled over and was taken to hospital. The pair were driving in a 110km/h zone when the assault occurred. Prosecutor Rebecca Lambert said he was lucky there were no severe consequences. “He was driving in a 110km/h zone, close to the roadworks area on the Bruce Highway,” Lambert told the Maroochydore Magistrates Court. “In my submission, it was good luck rather than good management that it didn’t result in more severe consequences.” According to The Daily Mail, the defendant was drunk at the time of the incident, which she couldn’t recall. The court heard Cope struggled with alcohol problems and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of childhood trauma. The car had damages amounting to R93 000, paid by an insurance company. In the past, Cope had alcohol-related offences and was sentenced for dangerously operating a car and causing a four-car crash in Maroochydore.
