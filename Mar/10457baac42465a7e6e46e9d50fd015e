2021 can easily be deemed a dark year for South Africans, with the stubborn continuation of the pandemic and ever growing socio-economic challenges. We really are living in dark days where joy and happiness are less common. Speaking of darkness, the years 2020 and 2021 have been marred with consistent rolling blackouts. Not the type that happen at a bar or shebeen, but the blackouts courtesy of Eskom. According to stats provided by Stats SA, in the year 2021 alone we have had more load shedding instances than the whole of 2020. Furthermore, Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter has revealed that South Africaâ€™s energy crisis will persist for the next two to five years. If that is anything to go by, we need to have things in place to keep productivity going. So, here are some items you need to invest in to keep you switched on during load shedding: 1. A strong power bank Power banks are used to charge battery powered items like mobile phones and other similar items that have a USB interface. To ensure that your device is always on, invest in a reputable power bank. 2. Pocket router Nothing stifles productivity more than the loss of electricity. If you are working from home because of the pandemic, then having a pocket router will go a long way in keeping you connected to the net. 3. Invest in gas appliances With electricity becoming a scarce resource, we need to invest in an alternative option like gas. From gas stoves and heaters, it is important to look at an alternative to ensure that our daily lives continue in the midst of darkness.
