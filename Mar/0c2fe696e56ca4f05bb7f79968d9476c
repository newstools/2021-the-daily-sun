HE is restless as he doesn’t know where his wife is buried. He claims his mamazala made the funeral arrangements and wanted nothing to do with him as she never approved of the relationship. Nkululeko Mswane didn’t even know the date of his wife’s burial. “She died on 20 February and I heard from neighbours she was buried on 24 February,” he said. The 33-year-old sangoma from Alexandra, north of Joburg, said he and his wife Thabo met at sangoma initiation school in 2014 and they got married the following year. “When we met she had a problem with carrying a child. She had miscarriages but we sorted the problem out,” he said. The grieving widower and dad of two said Thabo’s relationship with her mum suffered as the mum didn’t want to bless their marriage. “I tried to reconcile with them three times. Even though she made up with her mother, it was never the same again,” he said. Nkulukelo said the marriage had problems. When he involved family his mamazala refused. “It wasn’t fair but I let it happen for the sake of peace,” he said. “My mother-in-law didn’t approve of us being izangoma and told us to move our indumba away from her home.” He said his wife travelled home to Jane Furse in Limpopo and got sick when she got there. “She vomited and couldn’t eat solid foods. She got worse and came back to Alexandra,” he said. When Thabo died Nkulukelo didn’t have a say in her funeral arrangements. “When I asked about the date of burial, her mother gave me the wrong details,” he claimed. Daily Sun spoke to Nkulukelo’s mamazala Ruth Maboa, who said they were both at the clinic when Thabo died, but Nkululeko showed no interest in arranging the funeral. “I asked him to bring the kids but he refused. It’s funny how he suddenly has an interest in his wife’s burial when he could’ve been hands on from the beginning,” she said.
