STEVE Komphela is not a regular coach. The Mamelodi Sundowns mentor has made a reputation for himself as one of the most stylish coaches in football. Komphela is not only as stylish as some of his players but he is perhaps just as fit as well. The former Golden Arrows coach regularly works out and is not shy to flaunt his biceps now and then. His touchline drip is another thing that set him apart from his counterparts. Komphela has also recently shared another passion of his off the field, which is rising motorbikes. He took to his social media to share a picture of his hot Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Komphela is one of a handful of coaches who are kind enough to give fans a glimpse of his life outside of football. If he isnâ€™t in the gym working up a sweat, he is cruising the streets with his fancy bike. He also enjoys dressing up and sending fashion statements whenever he steps out of the house.
