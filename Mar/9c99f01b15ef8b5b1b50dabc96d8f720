BAROKA FC coach Matsimela Thoka says it will be a huge achievement for him if he can help Bakgaga finish in the top eight bracket this season. Since gaining promotion to the DStv Premiership five years ago, the Ga-Mphahlele based side have never played in the MTN8 competition. But Thoka, who is in his debut season as a head coach in the top flight, is confident Baroka will play in Wafa Wafa competition at the start of next season. “It has been my dream to coach in the PSL and I have achieved it,” said Thoka. “What I have learnt so far is that it is not easy to coach in the PSL, but the support I am getting from the club management is amazing. “All I want now is to repay the trust the chairman, Khurishi Mphahlele, has put in me by helping Baroka become a good side. Our goal this season is to finish in the top eight.” Thoka, who took over the helm this season after the team sacked Dylan Kerr, added: “To be honest, it will be a huge achievement for me to see Baroka in the top eight. Many coaches have come and failed to achieve that. But I am optimistic that this season things are going to be different. “The other thing is that I am lucky to coach a quality team like Baroka. We have players who are committed to seeing us achieve this season.” Baroka are currently eighth on the log with 20 points from 17 league matches. Thoka has 13 games to achieve his goal this season. Baroka face Golden Arrows in their next league encounter at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Wednesday (5pm). But Thoka’s team will be without Richard Mbulu, Leonardo Afonso and Vusi Sibiya due to injuries. “It is a blow to us and we will miss them. But the good thing is that we have a big squad,” said Thoka.
