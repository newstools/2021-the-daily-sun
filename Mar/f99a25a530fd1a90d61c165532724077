RESIDENTS of Flakplaas squatter camp in Spruitview, Ekurhuleni, were promised RDP houses years ago but they still haven’t received them. So many of them decided to build brick houses in the squatter camp. But one unfortunate resident is Khanyisile Gumbi (44), whose house was demolished by cops. “They told me this is private land and that residents are not supposed to build permanent structures on it,” she said. Khanyisile said she was confused as everyone in the area had a brick house. “How is it that I am the only one who suffered? “Am I the only one not allowed to build a brick house.” Khanyisile said she started building in December and was only left with the roofing. But as she doesn’t have a stable job, she’s doing one portion at a time, taking longer to finish her house. She claimed cops demolished part of the house last Wednesday and told her to demolish the rest. Videos of cops demolishing her house trended on social media. “They threatened to come with a TLB if I don’t demolish it,” she said. Khanyisile said they built the brick houses as shacks were not safe. “Shacks burn every now and then. We also fear gunshots. “We are afraid bullets may penetrate through the corrugated iron and injure or kill us. A brick can hold that bullet.” Khanyisile asked for any help. Ekurhuleni spokesman Zweli Dlamini confirmed that the cops demolished Khanyisile’s house. He said residents were not allowed to put permanent structures in the area and if found doing so, the structures were demolished. Dlamini said it was against the law to demolish the structure when someone already lived in it. “But we can demolish it while they are still building it and not living there yet.” Neighbours told Daily Sun this was not fair. “If it was possible, Khanyisile would have put the roof, doors and windows. “It is not fair she has to live in an unsafe shack while everyone in the area’s in a brick house,” Mantwa Kau (40) told the People’s Paper.
