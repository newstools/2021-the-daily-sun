POPULAR The Queen actress Cindy Mahlangu is not one to be messed with. She enlisted the help of her lawyers to get an apology from a tweep, who published a defamatory tweet about her. In the tweet, the tweep appears to be accusing Cindy of flirting with her boyfriend, who she said will soon be her ex. “I see a lot ish happening, but I choose to keep tf quiet. Not Cindy Thando being flewee by someone who is about to be my ex-nig*** (sic),” reads the tweet. But the actress didn’t take this lightly and quickly alerted her lawyers to come to her aid.

Our client also has no knowledge of the individual you are mentioning to be soon your ex-boyfriend/partner. Your tweet has impugned on the character, integrity and dignity of our client, as your tweet has been republished by tabloid websites,” reads the letter, in part. In the letter, she said should the woman fail to do as instructed, she would seek further legal recourse. “It is therefore our instructions that we demand the following: “That you retract your tweet of 5 March and issue an unreserved apology to our client and acknowledge the harm that your tweet has caused her. This retraction and apology must be published on your timeline by no later than close of business on 10 March.” The woman later issued an apology to the actress, acknowledging the harm her tweet may have caused Cindy. “I would like to unreservedly apologise to Cindy Thando for my tweet published on the 5 of March 2021. I was aggrieved by the turn of events, then went to publish without applying myself. Thus, I retract my tweet,” she tweeted. This is the apology I accept. https://t.co/Igpr13IwY0 pic.twitter.com/xpAYArUj19
