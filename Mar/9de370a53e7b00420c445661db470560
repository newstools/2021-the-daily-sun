KING Goodwill Zwelithini has died after spending about a month in hospital. The news was announced by the Zulu Monarch Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Buthelezi said the king died in hospital in the early hours of Friday, 12 March. “It is with the utmost grief that I inform the nation of the passing of his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka BhekuZulu, king of the Zulu nation. “Tragically, while still in the hospital, His Majesty’s health took a turn for the worse and he subsequently passed away in the early hours of this morning,” he said. Buthelezi said that on behalf of the Royal Family they thank the nation for their continued prayers and support in this most difficult time. “May His Majesty our king rest in peace.” Last month, Buthelezi announced the hospitalisation of the king in an undisclosed hospital in Zululand where the king was being treated for high glucose levels. In the middle of last month, the fake news of the death of the king circulated on social media and Buthelezi rubbished claims which were fueling more pain in the Royal Family. King Zwelithini reigned for almost 50 years. Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi is expected to give more details later today.
