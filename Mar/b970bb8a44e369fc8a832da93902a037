RESIDENTS in Jouberton, Klerksdorp are living in fear. This is because two gangs in the North West kasi, that call themselves Boko Haram and Vietnam, have been fighting in the area. According to residents, gang members exchange gun fire in broad daylight. They said they no longer felt safe and wanted the police to do something before innocent people died. “This has been going on for sometime now. We thought it would stop, but it’s getting worse,” said resident Thabang Semotlo (40). He said gang members also burnt houses and cars belonging to other gang members. Thabang even sent Daily Sun videos showing gang members chasing each other in the streets. Gunshots can be also be heard. Another resident, Julius Moselane, said they didn’t know what these gangs were fighting for. R40K BET ENDS IN TEARS! “The situation is hectic. We hear gunshots everyday.” As if that was not enough, on Monday, 1 March, one of the gangs stomped the Jouberton Police Station in Klerksdorp. They demanded to see the station commander. But it is not clear whether it was Boko Haram or Vietnam. The gang allegedly accused the police of favouring another gang. Things then got out of hand when the gang tried to disarm a cop carrying an R5 rifle. Members of the tactical response team had to intervene and successfully pushed the group out of the station. Police said the motive for the attack was unknown. But they said they suspected the incident was related to the setting alight of several houses and vehicles in the area since Saturday, 20 February. “Cases of malicious damage to property, attempted murder and arson were opened,” said the police in a statement. North West police commissioner Lieutenant-General Sello Kwena condemned the incident. He said no matter how one was dissatisfied, complaints should always be raised in an acceptable manner and within the ambit of the law.
