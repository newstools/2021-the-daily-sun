TSHWANE Human Settlements MMC Mpho Mehlape-Zimu and Action SA leader Herman Mashaba have visited the dam where two boys drowned on Saturday. Speaking at the dam in Mountain View, Mehlape-Zimu said the dam was formed due to a provincial project to build a road. “For some reason, they excavated and it became a dam after it rained. We were not informed of this particular dam as a city. “On Sunday when we were here after the tragedy, it became clear this is negligence as the place was not barricaded. We brought the Metro police and they will be patrolling around the area,” she said. Mehlape-Zimu said technically, the municipality didn’t have authority over provincial and national projects. “But I can’t fold my arms and say this is not our project. Some accidents can be prevented with a fence. However, we need a permanent solution and this area must be barricaded,” she said. Mehlape-Zimu said she still needed to engage the contractor to come up with a solution. She said the municipality was considering draining the water through the contractor but it would take time. Mashaba said he was concerned about negligence leading to the deaths of innocent children. “I’m shocked that it was not barricaded. Whoever is building here cannot tell me they didn’t know safety measures have to be taken care of,” he said. Mashaba said what happened was culpable homicide. He also visited the families of the two children. “The families have agreed with us that we have to help them with lawyers. We want to hold people liable civilly and criminally liable so the families can be properly compensated,” he said. The two kids who died were Siyabonga Mabila (7) and Lawrence Tshwenu (5).
