Impatient motorists must learn to change their bad behaviour. What ever happened to safe driving and respecting fellow road users? Impatient, aggressive drivers pose a serious danger to fellow drivers. Their mistakes make other people pay the ultimate price – with their lives. Nearly every time you hit the road you will see reckless drivers doing dangerous stunts. The fact remains that a response of anger on your part only further upsets you and can even lead to acts of violence in extreme cases of road rage. Drivers should admit when they’re in the wrong and apologise for their action. People tend to do ridiculous things on the road and get away with it. Drivers, through their reckless and thoughtless actions, put lives at risk. Please don’t react to those drivers who’re always looking out for fights or trying to provoke you. Just pull over and let them pass. Don’t even engage in eye contact. Just keep your hands on the steering wheel and don’t make hand gestures that may show your irritation or frustration with their misbehaviour. Avoid getting into a situation where you’re forced to race to get to an important meeting and end up taking deadly risks. Let’s learn to be responsible drivers. Letter by Slight Ramphaka Florida
