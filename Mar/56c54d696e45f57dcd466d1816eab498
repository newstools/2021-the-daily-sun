TS SPORTING chairman Slungu Thobela remains firm that he won’t pay Mozambican side CD da Costa do Sol a transfer fee for Chawananga Kaonga. Thobela said the matter is still before the court, even though Fifa asked the GladAfrica Championship club to pay an amount of US$48 062 (about R727 000). Sporting were notified by Fifa on 15 December and were given 45 days to pay the Mozambican side. If Sporting does not pay during this period, Fifa in a statement said they run the risk of being banned from registering any new players, either nationally or internationally, up until the due amount is paid and for the maximum duration of three entire and consecutive registration periods. The statement added: “The club shall also be restricted from playing an official match up until the due amount is paid, for the maximum duration of six months. “In the event that the payable amount as per in this decision is still not paid by the end of the bans imposed on the respondents, the present matter shall be submitted, upon request, to the Fifa Disciplinary Committee.” Today will be 45 days since Fifa furnished the team with the letter of demand. However, Thobela has argued that Malawian-born Kaonga came to them as a free agent. With him being a foreigner, the club also tried to get clarity from Fifa who then granted the player’s clearance to register him via the international transfer matching system (TSM). With that being the case, Thobela said nothing has changed and he won’t pay the money. “I’m still saying to you I won’t pay that money and I’m also yet to get communication from Fifa on what is the way forward,” said Thobela. The Malawi international, who joined Abantu Bemthetho at the beginning of last season, played when Sporting lost 2-1 to Richards Bay in the Nedbank Cup last-16 at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday.
