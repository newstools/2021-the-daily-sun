THE trial of three men accused of kidnapping and killing Gabisile Shabane and her nephew Nkosikhona Ngwenya was postponed to today. Gabisile (13) and Nkosikhona (15) were killed in 2018. Gabisile had albinism while Nkhosikhona didn’t, but was mistaken to have it because of his light complexion. The suspects appeared in the Middelburg High Court on Wednesday, where the case was postponed because the mastermind sangoma Thokozani Msibi (35) terminated his lawyer Werner Smit’s services. The case was also postponed on Monday as Thokozani did not arrive in court after the car he was being transport with broke down. Thokozani , Knowledge Mhlanga (31) and Brilliant Mkhize (25) face charges of housebreaking, murder and violation of a corpse. Their co-accused Themba Thubane (45), who pleaded guilty, is currently serving two life terms after being sentenced in 2019. The fifth accused, Mfanasibili Gamedze, died in jail. Gabisile’s mum, Annah Shabane, said the family had a gruelling two years waiting for the trial to start. “We want the killers to rot in jail. We hope the sentence meted to the other suspect will be transferred to the remaining three. We hope justice will be served,” she said. Tryphinah Nhlapo of Melokuhle Albinism Foundation said people with albinism lived in fear, adding that they’d never rest until justice was served. “Everywhere we go we have to be more careful because we have become like animals to people who are greedy. A jail sentence will teach others never to touch us. We want full protection. These people must know we’re not a gold mine,” she said.
