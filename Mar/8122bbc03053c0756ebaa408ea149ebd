GLADAFRICA Championship leaders Richards Bay are eager to cause another major upset in the Nedbank Cup quarter-final against struggling DStv Premiership outfit Chippa United at Sisa Dukashe Stadium tomorrow (3pm). The Natal Rich Boyz dumped Kaizer Chiefs out of the Ke Yona Cup in the last-32 round before beating fellow Championship side TS Sporting in the last round. However, coach Simo Dladla has confirmed that he’ll rest many of his players such as Sphamandla Mtolo, Malcolm Jacobs, Tsepo Mabua and Katlego Maphathe, because his priority is to win the Championship this season. The North Coast side from Kwa-Zulu Natal lead the Championship table with 28 points from 16 games. They head into this game unbeaten in 14 matches in all competitions. “We have our own goals and we want to go there and exploit their weaknesses,” Dladla stated. “And make sure we progress to the next stage. But it is always difficult to play against a team that is not winning. I understand they have not won in their six league matches and that makes it more complex and more difficult. “But we had an opportunity to watch them on Wednesday when they played against AmaZulu (where they lost 1-0) and I had to quickly warn the players that they won’t face the same team with the same attitude.” Dladla, who is familiar with the Eastern Cape, having previously played for Umtata Bush Bucks, will be relying on Khanyisa Mayo to deliver the goods for him once more. Mayo scored twice against Sporting and walked away with a Man of the Match award. Against Chiefs, Mayo claimed another Man of the Match award. “The boy is classy, has quality and a match winner. He is a special player. He can get you a goal out of nothing and I’m happy for him. Just seeing him growing, seeing working hard, it makes me happy,” added Dladla.
