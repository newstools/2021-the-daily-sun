CHIPPA United coach Dan “Dance” Malesela is feeling the effect of playing a number of games in a short space of time. And to add to Malesela’s pressure is that their next match is a DStv Premiership clash against Orlando Pirates at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday (5pm), who they have not defeated since September 2014. He doesn’t think they’ll even have time to train to prepare for the match. The former TS Galaxy coach revealed that they’ll meet this afternoon to analyse Bucs via video. Malesela, who captained Pirates during his playing days, will be looking to end his side’s current winless streak, which now stretches to four league matches since beating bottom side Black Leopards in January. The 12th placed Chilli Boys collected 16 points after 17 games, however, their opponents, Pirates have won six of their last seven games in all competitions since losing to Golden Arrows last month. Bucs are third on the table with 32 points after 19 games. The Soweto giants come to this game having defeated Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 on Tuesday. Pirates also beat the Eastern Cape-based side in the reverse league fixture at Orlando Stadium last December. “I don’t think we’ll even train for Pirates. It will just be a case of going home, rest and maybe we will meet later,” said Malesela. “It’s going to be difficult to play against Pirates because they have a huge squad to choose from and they can change at any given time. What we need here is the character we showed when we were on the road.” Malesela said the congested schedule is the cause of his side struggling to get maximum points. Against Cape Town City, they lost Andile Mbenyane early in the game to an injury and it’s not clear whether their long standing player will be fit for the match.
