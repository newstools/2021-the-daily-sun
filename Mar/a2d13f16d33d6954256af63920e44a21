PRETORIA Callies are on the verge of signing William Twala in a bid to gain promotion to the Premier Soccer League. The former Kaizer Chiefs winger has been training with the club hoping to secure a contract following a stint in Iraq where he played for top flight side Erbil SC. He moved overseas in October last year after being released by PSL outfit Chippa United in September. A reliable source told Daily Sun that Twala was homesick in Western Asia having joined the club on a one year deal. Said the Source: “Twala grabbed the opportunity to return home when Callies management approached him. The experience he  gained throughout the years will be vital to help them achieve their target of playing in the Premiership” Callies media officer Doctor Maphalle confirmed Twala’s arrival in Tshwane. He added: “Twala has been training with us since the start of this week. But I know nothing if he has already been signed. But when it happens management will notify me to inform our fans” Twala made 146 appearances in the PSL while playing for Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Chippa prior to his departure to Asia in search of greener pastures. However, it’s still unclear whether he will make his debut for Callies when they take on fellow GladAfrica Championship side Cape Town All Stars in the Nedbank Cup last eight at Danie Craven Stadium on Sunday.
