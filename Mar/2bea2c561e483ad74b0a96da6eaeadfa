TWO Mozambican men have been sentenced to spend 12 months in jail or a R2 000 fine for being in the country illegally and trespassed at the Kruger National Park on Friday, 5 March. Obadia Macuvele (34) and Fernando Mahlaula (25) appeared before the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court facing two counts of trespassing and being in the country illegally. Both pleaded guilty on the two charges before Magistrate Nhlanhla Malomane. Their lawyer Eric Mashele from the Legal Aid Board told the court that both his clients were on their way to Mzansi for job opportunities when they were arrested by rangers at Pretoriuskop in the Kruger National Park on 29 August. “My clients were on their way to this country to look for a job when accosted by rangers at the Pretoriuskop within the Kruger National Park. “They wronged the law for having avoided the port entry when entering this country, and are pleading guilty on both counts as such,” said Mashele. Magistrate Malomane sentenced them to 12 months’ imprisonment or a R2 000 fine each.
