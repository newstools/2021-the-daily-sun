GAMES in hand are not points! And Mamelodi Sundowns coach Manqoba Mngqithi is worried about his side’s upcoming tight fixture schedule in the DStv Premiership. Currently, the log leaders have played 18 matches, two behind most of the other clubs who have completed 20. The Downs coach would prefer to have played the same number of games as other teams. But Mngqithi understands that the defending champions are running to a different schedule from other teams as they are competing in the continental Caf Champions League. “You always want to be with the pack and play the same number of games. But we understand the circumstances, we know we have had far too many matches (due to the Champions League), maybe the same thing will happen to (Orlando) Pirates. “Pirates have only played two matches in the (Caf Confederation Cup) group stages, and we have played four. So already, they will also be in the same position where they will have to catch up somewhere.” Mngqithi says playing more matches has disadvantages, same as having games in hand. He explained: “The truth of the matter is it is always preferable to play the same number of games as everybody else. “And at times when you have played a game (or games) ahead and did not get a result, it is not the ideal situation for any team. Any coach would like to have played the same number of games as every other team in the league.” On Sunday, Mngqithi’s charges failed to open a six points gap at the top of the standings when they were held to a 1-1 draw by relegation haunted Black Leopards at Loftus. Mngqithi was left disappointed by the draw as they failed to take their chances. “At times, we just ask for these draws, I do not think this is a match that we should have drawn if you look at the quality chances we made. We did have chances that could have made the result different, we should have done better,” he said.
