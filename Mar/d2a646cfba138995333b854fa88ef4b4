AN AFFIDAVIT made by Nsfas’s legal adviser Adam Williams will not be submitted as evidence for the case against Sibongile Mani. This is because Mani’s legal representative, Asanda Pakade, was given the documents at short notice, and Prosecutor Luthando Makoyi should have gotten his permission before submitting the evidence to court, according to the Criminal Procedure Act. Mani, a student at Walter Sisulu University, was mistakenly paid R14 million by Nsfas in 2017 instead of R1 400 due to her. She allegedly spent R800 000. In the East London Regional Court on Wednesday, 24 March, Pakade told Magistrate Lynnette Olivier that Makoyi never told him he wanted to submit the affidavit, made in 2019. “The state had ample time to hand the necessary documents to the defence.” Makoyi admitted that the document was only given to the defence on Tuesday. He said it would not prejudice Mani’s case as the issues raised were already common cause. Olivier denied Makoyi’s application to submit the affidavit. She said she couldn’t ignore the fact that the defence did not consent and was not given two days’ notice. The case was postponed to 15 July.
