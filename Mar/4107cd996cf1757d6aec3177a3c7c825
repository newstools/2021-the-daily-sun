Government needs to implement stricter restrictions before the Easter weekend. We know how we behave on long weekends. The Easter super-spreader events will lead to the next wave of infections. The third wave is looming and we must be proactive. I agree with the call that the country be placed on a higher level of lockdown over the Easter weekend. Weâ€™ve done well to manage first and second Covid-19 waves. The holiday weekend will likely spur a third wave of the virus in South Africa, as people travel across provinces to spend time with family and attend mass religious gatherings. Some people just get carried away because of excitement.
