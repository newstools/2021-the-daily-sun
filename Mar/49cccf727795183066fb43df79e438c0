THE power struggle between President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule is set to play out in parliament. This comes as the National Assembly plans to debate the panel report on Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness and competency on 16 March. According to reports, Magashule has already fired his first shot by instructing ANC MPs not to vote with the DA to remove Mkhwebane, who is seen as one of his allies. In a series of tweets, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula went as far as labelling Mkhwebane a hired gun to fight political battles. Although Ramaphosa has not publicly expressed his views on Mkhwebane, the two have had a number of court battles. Friction between Ramaphosa and Magashule were ramped up after the secretary-general was charged with fraud and corruption. Magashule has remained defiant in the face of calls for him to step aside and recommendations by the ANC Integrity Commission. The house will debate whether the report should be adopted after which a parliamentary committee will be established to investigate further. With Magashule reportedly having read ANC MPs the riot act, some have rubbished his comparisons with the party toing the line during a motion of no confidence in former president Jacob Zuma. They said Zuma was an ANC deployee while Mkhwebane was not, meaning they had no allegiance to her. The ANC has 230 MPs and for the report to be adopted, the majority of the 400 MPs in parliament would have to pass it. The manner in which the ANC will vote will lay bare as to who wields power and set the tone before the ANC’s 2022 elective conference, where Magashule and Ramaphosa are likely to compete for the top job. The ANC Women’s League, which is aligned with Magashule, has called on all party MPs to vote against the axing of Mkhwebane.
