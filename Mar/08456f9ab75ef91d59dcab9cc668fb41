Actress and TV host Phindile Gwala has reflected on her childhood. In celebration of her strength and on International Women’s Day on Monday, 8 March, she looked back and remembered how she was ridiculed and insulted by fellow pupils. She said at some point she was called a rabbit, but this did not affect her confidence. She then encouraged women not to allow negative people to steal their light. Taking to Instagram, she wrote: “I still wonder where my confidence comes from. Sometimes I believe I was born with it... Yazi I was once called “Rabbit” at school because of my front teeth. Look at this beautiful smile, hhay bo mtase, don’t believe every fool who wants to dim your light... Happy International Women’s Day.” ALSO READ | SK KHOZA AND SIPHESIHLE VAZI GET NAKED In response to her post, her friends and fans related to her experience. Some even told her she has a gorgeous smile. Her friend, Abongs said she was also made fun of because of her strong melanin. She wrote: “That’s jealousy. They used to call me mthusugula because of my strong melanin. So much jealousy.” Sleey sos28 said: “They were jealous, wena my person. You have the most gorgeous smile.” “Thanks for such positivity. You inspire a lot of us,” wrote Hle Ndlovu. Last year Phindile revealed she was criticised for posting her man. Again she was not discouraged. At the time, she wrote: “I was criticised when I started posting my man a few years back. Isn’t it now a trend to post your partner? Don’t be afraid of showing off your blessings. People post their cars and lose them, post their new houses and get repossessed, posting about their new jobs and get retrenched. So nothing is guaranteed, nothing lives forever. Just do what feels right at that moment.” A post shared by Phindile Gwala-Ngandu (@phindilegwala_official)
