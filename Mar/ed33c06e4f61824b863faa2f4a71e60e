THE Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development launched a R1 billion Agri-Industrial Fund to boost black farmers. The fund was launched in Sandton yesterday. According to IDC and the department, the launch was a key development aimed at addressing funding constraints facing black farmers and breaking entry barriers to commercial farming. They said the fund was the department’s initiative, managed through its blended finance programme. Among other objectives, the fund will also be used to develop and implement high impact black-owned large scale commercial agricultural projects. READ: PRISON POKE INMATE SERVING LIFE FOR RAPE! IDC CEO Tokolo Nchocho said this was the first partnership of its kind between government and the development financial institution community. “This development demonstrates government’s trust in the IDC’s ability to play a role in different initiatives adopted to speed up economic recovery,” said Nchocho. “Through this partnership, funds will be provided to qualifying end beneficiaries as grants. “There will be no pricing and subsidy implications from a risk perspective factor.” The department’s acting director-general, Mooketsa Ramasodi, lauded the partnership. “The IDC has a grasp of some of the funding constraints facing black farmers, which is why we believe this partnership will help break down some of the barriers to entry, elevating these farmers to becoming fully fledged commercial farmers,” he said.
