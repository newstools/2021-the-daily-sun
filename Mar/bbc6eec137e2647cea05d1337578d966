  AMAZULU recent resurgence continues as they are chasing a top-five finish. Usuthu extended their unbeaten run to eight matches with a 1-0 victory over title-chasing SuperSport United in a DStv Premiership match that was played at Kings Park Stadium.  Under the guidance of coach Benni McCarthy Usuthu have been impressive.

On the 25th minute of the match, Usuthu were rewarded when Siphelele Mthembu scored the only goal of the match.  The defeat means SuperSport missing an opportunity of drawing level on points with the log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns.

In another league match that took place on Tuesday, Maritzburg United claimed a crucial 1-0 victory over Black Leopards in a bottom-of-the-table clash at Harry Gwala Stadium.  Thabiso Kutumela scored the key goal from a spot-kick in the dying minutes of the match after Ryan Rae was fouled inside the box.
