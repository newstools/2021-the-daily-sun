 SPINNING
has become an official sport in Mzansi, especially in the kasis. SunWheels
recently published about a R30 million Bugatti Veyron that was roaming the
streets of Sandton. This time
around, the guys at Daily Driven Exotics have done the unthinkable. They were
filmed spinning a similar Veyron. Bugatti
Veyron tyres cost about $10 000 each and $40 000 per set, which is about R600
000.
