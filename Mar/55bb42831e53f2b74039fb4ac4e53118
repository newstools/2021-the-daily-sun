MAMELODI Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana is not planning to retire anytime soon. Sunsport has reliably learnt that Kekana has been earmarked for a job within the club’s technical staff next season. This was also fuelled by fact that the veteran player has seen little action this season with goalkeeper Denis Onyango, defenders Mosa Lebusa and Ricardo Nascimento wearing the armband in his absence. The last time Kekana played 90 minutes was on 18 October last year when Downs lost 1-0 to Bloemfontein Celtic in the MTN8 Cup quarterfinal match played at Lucas Moripe Stadium. Since then, the 35-year-old has been warming the bench or not in the match day squad and this was evident on Sunday as Lebusa was preferred captain when Downs drew 1-1 with bottom club Black Leopards in a DStv Premiership match at Loftus Stadium. However, Kekana insist that he is still in the coaches plans as he is contracted to the club until June 2024. He said: “I am still contracted to the club as a player and I still have a lot to offer on the pitch. I am not planning to retire anytime soon.” His sentiments were echoed by Downs’ coach Manqoba Mngqithi He added: “We have had Ricardo a lot as captain and now he is out. We could easily have had Denis as captain‚ but he is always coming from far and we want to save him from all these runs to the referee. We want him to work a little bit more economically and focus on what is expected of him. The truth is that Hlompho is still captain of this club.” Downs Legal and Commercial manager Yogesh Singh said: “If you remember, the contract we gave KK last year was a 4-year-deal, Sundowns is his home. He may not be playing as often as last season, but KK makes a significant contribution to the Sundowns dressing room and will continue to do so. The skipper’s contribution cannot be measured by the minutes he plays or number of games he plays. Even when he is not playing, he provides leadership, guidance and support to the team.”
