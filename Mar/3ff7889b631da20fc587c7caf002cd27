When announcing the song in October, he said: “I don’t do things according to social media, advisors or lawyers, but according to God’s time. Right now was God’s time to do the right thing.” He also said he hadn’t forgotten about what happened. “Just because I entertain you guys on TV doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten about it. I’m still trying to cope with it. I am living with the scars every single day,” he said. “I am not going to be arrogant or proud. Since I came back from prison I have not spoken about it and I’d like it to stay like that because that’s how I prefer it. I haven’t seen the families and that’s because of my parole conditions. I need to respect the law as much as I respect them.” Shared post on Time
