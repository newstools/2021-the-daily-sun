NEW images have emerged of a high-end performance and luxury vehicle collection that burned to the ground late last year. The 80-large vehicle collection is believed to have been owned by a “wealthy classic car dealer” in the United Kingdom. Facebook page Supercar Advocates recently shared a gallery of new images, which are believed to depict the result of the same incident. According to The Sun, of the only recognisable car is a Ferrari LaFerrari, worth about R66 million. Other vehicles still able to be distinguished include a vintage Ferrari 400i and Jaguar E-Type. At the time of the incident, the Cheshire police force said ongoing joint investigations by firefighters and police had led them to believe the fire had been “started deliberately”.
