GAIZKA Mendieta flashes a big smile as he talks about the goal he scored against South Africa at the 2002 World Cup in Korea/Japan. The spectacular freekick helped separate Spain and Bafana Bafana in their group B match and later ensured condemned Jomo Sono’s team to a third-place finish. “I still remember that goal very well, ” Mendieta fondly remembers. “I have great memories from that tournament. We played against a strong team. They had not lost a match and they needed to get a result to go through. The Valencia and Spain legend is the LaLiga Mena/Africa ambassador. He has seen the popular Spanish league increasingly growing and making great strides in Africa as well as the increase of African footballers in the league, the great commercial deals, and rising opportunities for upcoming talent and local organisation. In a virtual press briefing, also joined by LaLiga SA head, Marco Pellegrini, Mendieta also talked about the inability of African nations to win the World Cup, let alone reach the semifinals. But he has insisted the gap between Caf representatives and their European counterparts was getting smaller. “I think African teams are favourites in any tournament. Many African players play in big leagues throughout the world especially in European, bringing talent from different countries in Africa. That makes African teams competitive.“ Mendieta reckons the next generation is emerging but has tipped Barcelona star Lionel Messi to continue his dominance. “I think we are very lucky to have had two of the best in Messi and Ronaldo in LaLiga for so long.“It’s impossible to replace such players. But with the talent coming through in the world that is starting to shine.”
