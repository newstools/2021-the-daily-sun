A VIDEO of a teacher combing a pupil’s hair at school set tongues wagging on Monday. Even Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi thought the act was “unacceptable” and wanted action taken. But some parents on social media said Lesufi was over-reacting as teachers back in the day used to do more than that. Ntshiza Skhotheni said: “Never forget that moment when my teacher told me I didn’t bathe, so I must go home and do so. I know that morning I didn’t bathe but to shout at me?” Divalady Qhawekazi Gcwensa KaMthunzi said: “In my times at school, they used to even bathe children who didn’t want to, in the centre of the yard where everyone would watch and laugh at them.” Slindokuhle Ntuli defended the teacher: “Our teachers used to cut our hair halfway and you would go home and cut the remaining section off. We never took any videos or hated them. Instead, we learned to do things right. Feeling sorry for children today because they don’t wanna learn anything and are disrespectful.” Sipho Kubayi felt what the teacher did was wrong: “A teacher once mocked me for not ironing my uniform when we had no iron at home. It was 2000 but I still haven’t forgiven her.” Sebza Greens said nothing was embarrassing in the video: “I can’t go to school looking like a phara. We are raising a generation of snowflakes. Growing up thinking that the world owes them something. A little bit of order is already abuse?”
