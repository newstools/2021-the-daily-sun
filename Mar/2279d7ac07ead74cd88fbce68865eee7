THE death of a Cape Town activist has left her loved ones heartbroken. Salonica Mbambane was found dead on Saturday. The 34-year-old mum of three allegedly fought with her boyfriend when she visited unannounced. According to Salonica’s uncle Christopher Notshulwana (54), she was with her aunt on Friday when she called him. The boyfriend stays in Phoenix, Milnerton. “She suspected someone was in the room with her boyfriend,” said Christopher. “I’m told she requested an Uber around midnight to go to his place. “The boyfriend called her aunt at about 2am to tell her she was causing problems, but when the aunt called her she said everything was fine.” But the boyfriend called the family to his place on Saturday morning, where they found her body in a corridor outside his house. It had bruises on the back, ribs and neck. “We don’t know what really happened and will wait for cops to provide us with more information. We’re in shock,” said Christopher. Nata Mfaxa (32) said she’d known Salonica for 28 years. “I’m shattered. She was there for me many times. I never thought I’d bury my friend this early.” Salonica joined the Singabalapha Group, which lives in tents in Observatory and demands affordable houses near the city centre, in 2019. Group leader Barbara Vusa said Salonica: “My heart is bleeding. We lost a fighter who stood her ground for a just society.” Salonica will be buried on 1 April. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “The investigation is at a sensitive stage. This office isn’t in a position to divulge any information.” She said a death inquest was opened.
