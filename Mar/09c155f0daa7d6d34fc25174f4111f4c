SKEEM Saam actress Pebetsi Matlaila is grateful to be alive. She and her family were involved in an accident after a traumatic hijacking attempt. The incident happened on her way home after she had dinner with a loved one at the airport. The star took to social media to share the ordeal and warn others about such incidents. “On Friday night my family and I were involved in a car accident while escaping an attempted hijacking,” she wrote. “Besides the shock and minor injuries, everyone involved in the accident escaped unharmed.” Pebetsi told Daily Sun that she was with her husband and daughter at the time of the hijacking attempt and accident, which shook them. “I’m grateful no one was harmed. My family was able to get assistance almost immediately after the accident,” she said. “As a pregnant woman you’re a priority and the medical and insurance assistance was there.” She shared with SunReaders the importance of having medical aid and insurance. “We often take it for granted, but we need to have such even with the little we have,” she said. Pebetsi, who stars as Mokgadi on Skeem Saam, advised people to limit what they share on social media. “I’m not saying what happened was because I shared on social media, but we need to be aware not everyone is happy for you. “Certain things need to be kept sacred and it’s lessons learned. Choose how much you share, especially about your life. “I had to share because of my work. It’s better to announce things myself rather than allow someone else to tell my story.” Pebetsi said people have to be alert and careful while on the road. “Criminals are stranded for cash right now and will do anything. We need to be alert,” she said. “Drinking and driving is out of the question. “My family looks forward to great things to come, including the arrival of our bundle of joy.”
