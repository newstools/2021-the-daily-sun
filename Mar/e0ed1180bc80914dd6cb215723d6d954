IT was
originally commissioned by Moammar Gaddafi in 2010. This
luxurious Maybach coupe never reached its destination due to the downfall of
his government a year later. In a new
video published by MercBenzKing, all the little details that make this lavish
two-door Maybach so special are revealed. The
two-tone 57S Coupe is the fourth one made by Xenatec coachbuilder, and in the
video, the third one also makes a brief appearance. According
to Motor1, the V12 6.0-liter engine under the hood has a very respectable
output of 471 kW and 1000 Nm of torque.
