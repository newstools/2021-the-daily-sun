WHILE most African players use muti to be invincible in the field of play, soccer stars in Europe opt for products in the pharmacy shelves. Wolverhampton Wanderers' winger Adama Traore has a trick up his shoulders, but it's not the popular 'Phunyuka Bamphethe' in South Africa. His blistering pace always gives opposition defenders a slippery on him in their quest to hit the brakes on him. REUTERS reports that in a bid to prevent defenders grabbing hold of Traore, Wolves' medical department has come up with the ingenious solution of lathering the Spaniard's muscled arms with baby oil before and during matches.  He's always backed himself against any full back, thanks to his blistering pace and rock-solid build and the Premier League club have come up with a ploy to make it nearly impossible to catch him on the pitch. Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo, according to REUTERS, said the trick has ensured they do not lose Traore to niggling injuries too. "I thought it was honestly a fantastic idea by the medical department because it came from the injury that he had with his shoulder," Nuno told a news conference ahead of Tuesday's trip to runaway league leaders Manchester City. "That was caused basically because of holding of his arm and creating this strong impact on his shoulder and he got injured from that. "It's very hard to stop Adama, and that (baby oil) avoids that situation. He becomes more slippery, so we get the advantage of his speed and talent. It was an option to avoid it, and from then on, he's kept on doing it and it's good." Traore recorded four goals and nine assists in the league last season to help Wolves secure a seventh-place finish for a second consecutive season, although they are currently 12th.
