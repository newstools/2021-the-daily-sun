Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer criticised Kaizer Chiefs boss Gavin Hunt for employing defensive and counter-attacking tactics in the Soweto derby. Chiefs came out on top 1-0 thanks to a Samir Nurkovic winner at FNB Stadium on Sunday, but Zinnbauer was not impressed by his opposite number's tactics. "I don't know, they had chances, yes, but it's not normal you play a counter-attack play at home, for me sorry, it's not possible for me. As a coach, a home game and I play a deep block," Zinnabuer told SuperSport TV. "You have to win, we say it before, the target is three points for the supporters, a big chance you jump into second place, this is the next point [step] and 100 derbies, this is 100% what the players want but it was not our day today." "We saw in the first-half we don't have enough power in the final third, it's possible the game gives us the information, it's possible they stay very deep most of the time with a low block and this was the reason we wanted a little bit of offence," Zinnbauer added. "'Figo' [Linda Mntambo] and Ntsiki [Ntsikelelo Nyauza] were not bad in the game but we needed more. "[Kabelo] Dlamini you always find in the small space, solution, Ndlovu played very well in the last game as a full-back. "This was the reason, not that 'Ntsiki' or Linda was bad, this was only for tactical aspects. "We won before three games against Kaizer Chiefs, the supporters were happy, this is football if you don't have the right performance on the right day and you don't have the luck." -TeamTalk Media
