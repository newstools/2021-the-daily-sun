LIVESTOCK owners at Sebokeng Hostel in the Vaal are reeling in shock. The hostel has been hit by swine fever! More than 350 pigs have died since 15 March, according to the Gauteng Department of Agriculture. Government was alerted to the abnormal number of pigs dying at the hostel and investigations showed the animals died of African swine fever. Residents have been warned against buying pork from informal traders as it poses a danger to humans. In a report seen by Daily Sun, the Chief State Veterinarian for Animal Health Regulatory Services, Dr Duma Mpofu, said there’s neither a treatment nor a vaccine. “Pig owners are advised to confine their pigs and avoid bringing in new stock,” said Dr Mpofu. Many livestock owners said government isn’t helping them. “We live off selling this livestock. We don’t know how we’ll be helped,” an owner told Daily Sun. Another said: “The departments will not help. We expected that they’ll help us with a little incentive to make up for what we lost.” The report said the hot spots of the outbreak are the informal structures erected on land not designated for agricultural purposes at Hostel 1. It said 53 people own over 1 089 pigs. In past weeks, 353 pigs died and 43 were sick. The pigs have been placed under quarantine and owners were advised on how to safely dispose of carcasses. Carcasses are now removed from the designated area on a regular basis to be disposed of in a safe and identified dumping area. Informal slaughter houses have been closed. The ward councillor in the area, Mthuzimele Sikukula, led engagements with livestock owners and scheduled a meeting to be held at a local hall on Thursday, 1 April. Sikukula said they will engage all the owners on a possible way to save their dying pigs. “We need to make sure the records we have of their livestock are correct so we save the remaining. The livestock owners live off these animals, to see them lose their fortune like this is really disturbing.”
