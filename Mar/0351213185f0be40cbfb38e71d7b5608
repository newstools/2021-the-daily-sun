WAITING in the queue to collect their Covid-19 grant relief ended in tragedy for two residents. Benjamin Mahasa (47) and an unnamed woman (38) were queuing at Mandela Park Shopping Complex post office in QwaQwa, Free State, when they were shot and killed. It happened on Monday, 22 February. Other beneficiaries told Daily Sun an argument started when a man brought people to the queue and forced them to stand in front of the victims, who were shot several times. They were taken to hospital, where Benjamin died a few days later. The woman is still fighting for her life. Benjamin was buried on Sunday, 28 February. At the funeral, family representative Maqhawana Mofokeng said: “It’s painful to lose one of our brothers. “I wish the police quickened their investigations and arrested the suspect. We need to know who killed our brother.” Maluti-A-Phofung Mayor Masetjhaba Lakaje-Mosia said: “This is the second person who allegedly died at the hands of gangsters. A matric pupil was killed immediately after the announcement of matric results. “I wrote a letter to Police MEC Sam Mashinini and to Brigadier Moses Mohloare asking them to deploy police all over Maluti-A-Phofung. “It hurts to see gangsters terrorise our people, robbing and killing them like insects.” Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said murder and attempted murder cases were being investigated.
