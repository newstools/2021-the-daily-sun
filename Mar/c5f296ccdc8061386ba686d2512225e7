THE family of Rhulani Macheka has been left devastated by his sudden death. His mum Sibongile (43) said the nine-year-old was playing near their home in Winterveldt, Tshwane, on Wednesday, 17 March when concrete pillars fell on him. “He was playing with a friend on a wall of concrete pillars. His friend suddenly came running to tell us that one of the pillars had fallen on top of Rhulani,” she said. “When I went to check on my son, he was under a heavy pile of pillars. His left hand and leg were broken, and he was bleeding through his mouth, nose and ears. “He was not moving when we arrived at the clinic. We suspect he bled to death. He was certified dead on arrival at Kgabo Clinic.” The mother of eight said Rhulani was a good boy, but it was not the first time he was seriously injured.  In 2019, he was hit by a car while standing outside their gate and was admitted to hospital for three days. “We are heartbroken by his sudden death. He loved playing with other children,” she said. Rhulani’s father Patrick Ndlovu (45) said he was traumatised. “He was my friend as he would come and greet me every morning. We were close. He loved me and was a respectful child,” he said. Patrick said he suspected his son had bad luck because bad things kept following him. “We are not working and don’t have money to bury our son. We are pleading for help. We are still waiting for post mortem results so we can arrange his funeral.” Residents and the family said they didn’t know who owned the concrete pillars around an empty piece of land. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said: “A inquest docket was opened.”
