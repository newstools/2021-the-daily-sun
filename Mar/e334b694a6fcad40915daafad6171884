MEDIA personality, businesswoman and philanthropist Relebogile Mabotja has revealed that she is pregnant with her first child. She revealed the news in a social media post that also carried the link of her tell-all interview with an online magazine, Batswadi. In the interview, she said that the pregnancy was teaching her about patience and surrender. “Because I’m an A-type personality who likes to be in control of everything and because I like to plan everything, for the first time in my life I’m forced to surrender. “And that includes things like having to surrender to the fact that today I might have to get nine hours of sleep, surrender to the fact that I’m too tired to continue this task, surrender to the fact that I can’t stay up as long as I used to, or that I can’t wake up as early as I used to.

She also said that through this journey, she has come to realise that there are so many women who suffer from many complications like fibroids, miscarriages, difficulties with falling pregnant… and it’s not often we hear the painful side of pregnancy. “We often hear the wonderful side and mine has been very difficult… Having a sense of community has been as important as having a partner’s support. It’s so important that we share information so we can continue learning from each other,” she said.
