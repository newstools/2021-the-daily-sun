WAR over a piece of land is suspected to have been the reason why six family members were shot and killed in their house in Eshowe, northern KZN, two weeks ago. This was revealed by Sgampu family member Thokozani Mbatha during the burial of four of the deceased in Inanda, north of Durban, on Saturday. During the incident on 20 February, husband Christopher (72), niece Snothile (18), wife Bhikho (62), her daughter Mbali (29), grandchildren Thabo (10) and Elihle Khumalo (7) were killed allegedly by Sthembiso Mthimkhulu (36). Mthimkhulu is Christopher’s nephew and he is a social worker. Mbatha said Bhikho and Christopher stayed in Durban for a very long time while they were still working. “It was a few years ago when they decided to go live in the land of Christopher’s forefathers when they retired. When they got there, they used a piece of land to plough sugarcane. “Some family members didn’t like that so much that they demanded that the deceased bring back the land to which they disagreed because they also believed they had a right to use the land as it belonged to Christopher’s parents too,” said Mbatha. She revealed that it was out of the manner in which her sister and her kids were killed that the Sgampu family decided that they are going to have their burial back in her birth place, Inanda. “We fought tooth and nail that we get their bodies in our possession so that we could bury them ourselves,” said Mbatha. She added that culturally they had a right to do so because certain marriage rituals were not completed. “Culturally, my sister and her kids still belonged to the Sgampu family. We had a right to take them if we felt we wanted to,” said Mbatha. She said in the Eshowe Magistrates Court on Friday, Mthimkhulu abandoned his bail application and the case was postponed to April.
