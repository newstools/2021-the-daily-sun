LIVERPOOL midfielder Curtis Jones dedicated his goal in Sunday’s 2-0 Premier League win at Sheffield United to goalkeeper Alisson Becker, whose father died last week. Jose Becker (57) drowned in a lake near his holiday home in southern Brazil last Wednesday, local police said. He had been swimming at a dam on his property when the accident happened, Doroteo Machado Filho, a police inspector in the town of Lavras do Sul, said. No foul play was suspected. “I’d like to take this time to say that this goal is for Ali’s dad. May he rest in peace and if Ali sees this, this is for you, bro,” Jones told Sky Sports. “He’s a strong lad and a big part of the team. He’s not here today but we miss him, for sure.” Jones and a Kean Bryan own goal gave Liverpool a 2-0 win over bottom side Sheffield United as the Merseyside team snapped a run of four straight league defeats. Liverpool are sixth on the table with 43 points after 26 games. They host fifth-placed Chelsea on Thursday. – REUTERS
