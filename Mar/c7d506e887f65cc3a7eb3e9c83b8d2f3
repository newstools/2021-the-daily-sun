A DESPERATE family is hoping that a man who was buried in 2004 is their father. This after Samuel Zwane went missing 17 years ago. His family searched for him when he did not return home from work on 23 July 2004. But yesterday, the family received hope when a body, believed to be Samuel’s, was exhumed at Olievenhoutbosch Cemetery in Centurion. The family hoped a DNA test would prove the body to be his. Son Casper (54) told Daily Sun when his dad went missing, they enquired with his company, but it also didn’t know his whereabouts. They then opened a missing persons case and searched at hospitals, police stations and mortuaries. “When we got to the government mortuary in Hillbrow, his name was captured on the registry, but his body wasn’t there. It was later discovered it was removed from the mortuary.

We managed to trace her son. He said our dad was buried in the same grave as his cousin, who died in a shack fire. He took us to the grave,” said Casper. Grandson Seetjo Botipe said: “We want closure and answers. Our gogo died in December upon hearing news of the exhumation. “The family has suffered so much trauma.” At the time of going to print, cops had not responded to the People’s Paper.
