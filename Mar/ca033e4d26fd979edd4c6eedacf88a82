OPERATION Okae Molao was felt throughout Soweto and other parts of Gauteng over the weekend. More than 150 people were arrested for various crimes! Drunk drivers ran out of luck at roadblocks on Soweto’s Impala Road. At least 30 people were taken into custody after failing breathalyser tests and spent the weekend behind bars. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela told Daily Sun: “We regard drinking and driving as a serious violation. “You put the lives of innocent people in danger, and if we find you we’ll show no mercy. “I want to urge motorists not to drink and drive.” Mawela said police nabbed a wanted suspect linked to a string of cash van heists. “Our team picked up a suspect who had a warrant of arrest issued against him and his accomplices in Vryheid, KZN. “We also recovered three AK47s, one R4 and a jamming device. “This made it one of the most successful nights for law enforcement agencies.” Mawela thanked those who adhered to lockdown regulations. “We still have pockets of excellence but have those who always break the law,” he said. “Overall, the situation is controllable.  We’re also thankful to Gauteng residents for their co-operation.”
