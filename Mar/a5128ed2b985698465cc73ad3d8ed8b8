A SENIOR traffic officer (32) at Msukalikwa Municipality in Gert Sibande District, Mpumalanga was granted R1 500 bail by the Ermelo Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 3 March. He was arrested by Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation members and members of Road Traffic Management Corporation Head Office in Mpumalanga for corruption. Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said his arrest came after several complaints were received about law enforcement officers who were allegedly soliciting bribes from the public who commit traffic violations. “The operation was conducted on 22 February, where the said officer allegedly demanded bribery from officials who were undercover agents. “A further investigation also established that members of the public who committed serious traffic violations were not prosecuted, but gratifications were allegedly paid to corrupt officials,” said Sekgotodi. The matter has been postponed until 26 March for further investigation.
