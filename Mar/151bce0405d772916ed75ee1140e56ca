AYAPHELA ama-tyre! This was the cry of motorists in the Vaal, south of Jozi, who said one needed to be vigilant of potholes when driving in the area. They told Daily Sun they spent a lot of money fixing or buying tyres. Paseka Thlabanelo (23) said he spent more money on tyres every month than on petrol. “I bought four tyres this month alone because of these bad roads. I know I should at least expect to hit a new pothole every weekend,” he said. Nthabiseng Mofokeng (30) said: “I now know where all the potholes are in my hood. “But other drivers are just reckless and lead you to a pothole. I’ve spent almost R2 000 on tyres in two months.”  Potholes in the area are as big as sinkholes! But Emfuleni municipal spokesman Makhosonke Sangweni said the municipality was working on fixing the bad roads and potholes. “We’re doing pothole and roads resealing,” he said. “The project is run jointly with the provincial government as part of an intervention process to revive service delivery and bring financial stability to the municipality.”
