SINGER Chomee has defended herself in the wake of the National Arts Council (NAC) scandal. In a statement, she painted herself as the victim, saying the reports about her were fuelled by the fact that she was black. “Is it because I’m not deserving of funding or because I am a black woman? The list released showed women of all races who applied for funding. It got approved and they received some payment. No one is asking them anything. Were they asked who they dated before or is it just me?” she asked. The artist further said the presidential employment stimulus programme was meant for job creation, and that no journalist had bothered to ask her if she had planned to create jobs with the money she had received. Chomee said she too was affected by the lockdown and suffered losses as a result because she couldn’t do gigs. “I was affected by the lockdown like all other practitioners and lost a lot of work. Why am I under scrutiny? Is it because a black woman is not deserving of R2 million funding? Is it because a black woman cannot manage money or projects meant to empower others in the industry?” She and Arthur have been on the receiving end of a backlash from artists who didn’t get funding from the NAC.
