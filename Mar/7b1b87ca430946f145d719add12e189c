THAKGALO Leshabela finally took his English Premiership bow as he featured for Leicester City as they walloped Sheffield United 5-0 on Sunday.  Leshabela came on in the second half as Leicester, replacing Ayoze Perez as crushed Sheffield into smithereens at the King Power Stadium.  The day, however, belonged to Nigerian international Kelechi Iheanacho, who scored an incredible hat trick as the Foxes routed to move to second spot in the Premier League table.  But it was a dream debut for the South African-born youngster.  He became the second South African to make an English Premiership appearance after Percy Tau of Brighton & Hove Albion this season.  But he joins a long list of Mzansi players, who have featured in the popular European league.  In an era when South Africa battle to export local talent overseas, it was quite refreshing to see young Kgathalo Leshabela make his debut.  The 21-year-old is in coach David Notoane’s preliminary squad for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in Japan and it is not hard to figure out reasons for his inclusion.
