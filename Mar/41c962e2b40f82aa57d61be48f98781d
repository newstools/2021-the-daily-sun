The CRL Rights Commission is expected to conduct a hearing involving Boulders Shopping Centre manager Jose Maponyane and Ndebele activist Thando Mahlangu on Wednesday. The hearing comes after Jose was captured instructing Thando to leave while he was inside a Clicks store last week. He was told his isiNdebele traditional attire was indecent. The video has since gone viral, causing a public outcry. Clicks, shortly after the incident, said it had intervened and asked Jose to leave. Thando was then allowed to continue shopping. It is understood Jose was later suspended with immediate effect. The commission said Thando and Jose, as well as the centre management, are expected to appear before it.
