THE family of Mthokozisi Ntumba was still looking forward to more from him. Sadly, his life was cut short during a protest that he was not even a part of. According to his family, Mthokozisi was in Hillbrow in Joburg for medical reasons, but never returned home. Family spokesman Sthembiso Jwara said: “We are shocked. He left home in the morning to go to the doctor. He was not part of any protest.” He said they wanted justice to be served, adding that Mthokozisi did not have to die the way he did. Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the family following the death. Cele told the family that he couldn’t really explain what happened, but that someone went crazy. He said the situation could have been handled better, and emphasised the need for better policing. The minister said that things were getting to a point where he couldn’t defend the actions of some police officers. The family said Mthokozisi left behind his wife and four children, the youngest being only eight months old.
