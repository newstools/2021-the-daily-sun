THE human bones reported missing at a government mortuary in Standerton on Friday, 19 March have been found. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the bones, part of an investigation into the murder of former police captain Johannes Engelbrecht (62), were brought back from Newcastle in KZN on Tuesday, 23 March. Police were informed by their counterparts at the Department of Health the bones were mistakenly collected, together with two corpses scheduled to be taken to Newcastle. The officials alerted their colleagues in Standerton as soon as they picked up the error. It’s now been established the bones were never stolen. The investigation into the murder of Engelbrecht continues. “Captain Engelbrecht was reported missing by his family in October 2020,” said Hlathi. “Police launched a search for him without any success until 12 March when 26-year-old Sanele Msimang handed himself over to the Harrismith Police Station in the Free State. “Msimang informed police he killed Captain Engelbrecht, his employer, in Standerton somewhere last year and buried his remains in a shallow grave. “He was detained at Harrismith cop shop and arrangements were made that he be brought to Standerton to face charges.” Hlathi said Msimang arrived at Standerton cop shop on 15 March and pointed out where he buried the remains of his employer, which were exhumed and taken to a government mortuary. “A murder case was opened. Msimang was charged and appeared in the Standerton Magistrates Court on 18 March. “He appeared before the same court on Tuesday, 23 March. The magistrate ordered that a bail application be heard today, 24 March.” Msimang remains in custody.
