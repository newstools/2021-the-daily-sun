ONE of Mzansi’s most decorated fighter and former WBA & IBF world light flyweight champion, Hector “Hekkie” Budler and former IBO lightweight champion, Xolisani “Nomeva” Ndongeni will headline a boxing tournament later this month. The duo’s duel will mark and commemorate this year’s Human Rights Day and International Women’s Month on 20 March. The six bout boxing spectacle will be staged by TLB Boxing Promotions in collaboration with Mpumalanga Sports Department. It will take place at the Graceland Casino in Secunda. This is TLB’s first event to be staged outside of its Gauteng home turf. Aptly dubbed the “Return of the Big Guns,” the tournament will mark Budler’s long anticipated return to the ring after what he describes as a “frustrating and terrible” two-year hiatus from competitive activity. He will headline the tournament in a 10-round International Flyweight bout against Muhsin Kizota from Tanzania. Meanwhile, the main supporting bout will see Ndongeni square off against Malawi’s Byson Gwayani in a 10-round international light-weight bout.
