THE family of late Skeem Saam actor Charles “Big Boy” Maja is happy his tombstone was finally erected. This after waiting for almost a year for Bataung Memorial Tombstone to erect it. The R75 000 tombstone was a donation from Bataung through Limpopo Artist Movement (LAM). It was erected at his home village in Ga-Maja outside Polokwane, Limpopo over the weekend. Charles’ widow, Sophy (54), said she couldn’t believe it when she got a call from Bataung that they were erecting the tombstone. She said that she gathered the family to witness the moment. “We watched them as they erected it. I was happy and sad when they erected it. We had waited for the tombstone for a very long time,” said Sophy. She told Daily Sun that she believes her husband would now rest in peace. ALSO READ:
