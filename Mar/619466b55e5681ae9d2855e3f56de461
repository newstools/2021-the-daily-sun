BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has assured Mzansi that his side will get the job done and qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). Bafana face Sudan in a must win Afcon qualifier at Khartoum International Stadium on Sunday (6pm). Ntseki’s side head into the crunch match needing only a point to seal their qualification. They are hoping to qualify for back-to-back Afcon tournaments having managed to qualify for the last edition held in Egypt. They reached the quarter finals in that edition, bowing out to Nigeria. Ntseki has said they intend to better that finish in the next edition, but they can only do that if they earn the right to participate. Bafana, who are on ten points in Group C, equal with Ghana who have already sealed their spot thanks to their better head-to-head against Bafana, will be hoping to grab the other spot. “We are looking forward to a very tough match given that it’s the final match of the qualifiers,” said Ntseki. “We all want to qualify, every country, player and coach will be looking forward to this one. “We will do the business. We are here to represent our country. We are here to book our spot in the Afcon. “We have a lot of respect for Sudan, but may our team be the one to go through and qualify for the Afcon.”
