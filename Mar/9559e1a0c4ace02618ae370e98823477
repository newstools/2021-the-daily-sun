PASTOR Timothy Omotoso lost his application in court for the NPA to produce emails relating to the charges against him. Omotoso, who is accused of rape, sexual assault and racketeering, was calm as he sat in the high court in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape, holding his Bible yesterday. State Advocate Velile Makhosana refused to hand over secret emails allegedly sent by accuser Cheryl Zondi. “I oppose the application and the emails in question belong to the state,” he said. Omotoso’s defence Advocate Peter Daubermann told the court: “I will be consulting and we will take it from there.” The court adjourned until Thursday, 18 March when it will resume for witnesses to testify. Members of the church waited outside and after receiving feedback from leaders, they started praying. Judge Irma Schoeman told the court: “Omotoso will remain in custody and he will appear in the high court again.”
