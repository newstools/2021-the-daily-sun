Two
teenagers have been arrested for allegedly murdering an 11-year-old boy in
Limpopo. The
teenagers, both aged 15, were arrested in Seshego outside Polokwane after the
boy's body was found in Ga-Makweya village on Tuesday night. "The
young boy from the adjacent village of Ga-Mamadila was apparently lured by the
suspects from the same village to go to a soccer match at the neighbouring
Makweya village on Monday," police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela
Mojapelo said. "When
the victim did not return home that evening, the family reported him missing at
Seshego police station the following day." A search
was launched immediately, and the initial investigations led the police to the
two teenagers, who were found in possession of the victim's cellphone, Mojapelo
said. Further
investigations led police to the spot where the body of the 11-year-old boy was
found. He was identified as Tibane Mahanyele. The
teenagers will be assessed by a probation officer. They were expected to appear
in the Seshego Magistrate's Court soon. SOURCE:
