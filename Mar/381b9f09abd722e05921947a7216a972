CAPE Town City coach Johannes Olde Riekerink has admitted that this is a difficult period for his side. City were unable to hold on and beat Golden Arrows in the DStv Premiership match at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday. Despite taking the lead through new signing Abdul Ajagun in as early as the fourth minute of the game, Arrows hit back to level the matters through Velemseni Ndwandwe to see the game ends 1-1 draw. This means City are on the winless run of seven games in all competitions. In the league, it is also seven games without a victory since beating the very same Arrows 4-2 in January. Because of how Arrows have punched above their weight, lying second on the table, Riekerink said he knew that the Durban-based side would be a difficult side to break down. “We deserve to win the match because we played a little different compared to other systems in other games,” said Riekerink who was without his top scorer Mduduzi Mdantsane because of suspension. “I think we had a better part of the game and also in the second half, I was very happy with the way we played. I think we created very few chances to score to make it 2-1. “I’m very happy in this difficult period on how we played because we showed confidence.” Having lost 4-2 to City in the first round and also 4-1 to the same opponent when last season was completed in the bio bubble, Arrows coach Mandla Ncikazi felt they had a chance to beat City, who they have not defeated now in the last four games. “I thought my players gave their all and we played good football. Maybe we didn’t take the chances that came our way,” said Ncikazi. “But let’s take this point and build on it. We’ll just play each game as it comes and I trust these boys as they have done exceptionally well.”
