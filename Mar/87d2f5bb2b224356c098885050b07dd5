A DURBAN lawyer was found lying in the mortuary on Monday, 8 March. Ntuthuko Goba (30) of Folweni, south of Durban went missing on Friday. He was also a part-time Uber driver. He allegedly left his office and informed his girlfriend that he was on his way to Umlazi to pick up a client. That was the last time he was seen. When his family called him on his cellphone, it was off. The following day his silver VW Polo was found in Golokodo, Folweni with some parts missing. His uncle Dumisani Bhengu said they couldn’t talk because they didn’t have information about what happened. “We searched for him with no luck until Monday when we got a call from an investigating officer telling us to come to Umzinto mortuary to identify a body. Indeed, it was him. We don’t know what happened. If you want information, speak to the investigating officer,” said the uncle. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “A case of murder is being investigated by Isipingo police. A body of a 30-year-old man was found on Plattdrive in Isipingo Hills. The victim sustained gunshot wounds in the stomach. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.”
