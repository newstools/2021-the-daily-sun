THIRTEEN men are behind bars for being involved in the illegal mining trade. They were arrested in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni on Saturday. Metro police spokesman Kobeli Mokheseng told Daily Sun cops had a huge breakthrough when they bust the 13. He said the arrests came after patrolling officers were flagged by security personnel from a private company about an illegal mining operation in the area. “Officers responded promptly and arrested 13 suspects aged between 20 and 40 and confiscated equipment allegedly used in committing this criminal activity.” Mokheseng said some of the arrested men were undocumented. “The offenders face charges related to illegal mining and the undocumented were booked under the Migration Act.” He also said all the detained suspects were expected to appear in the Boksburg Magistrates Court soon. Ekurhuleni residents said they were tired of zama zamas. They said they didn’t feel safe and were happy the suspects were jailed. “There’s obviously still a long way to go, but at least there’s hope they’ll be gone one day,” said Mavis Mogale (38). Ben Mthethwa (33) said they’ve been complaining about zama zamas for a while and they got bust but continued with their job a week later. “They have no respect for the law. I would recommend that police do regular patrols. We need them gone. We can’t live with such people our communities,” said Ben. Mbalenhle Ntshangase (33) believed there would be less zama zamas if cops patrolled regularly ekasi. “Our communities would be a safe place. I believe these people are also behind the robberies and house breakings in our kasis. We’re tired,” said Mbalenhle.
