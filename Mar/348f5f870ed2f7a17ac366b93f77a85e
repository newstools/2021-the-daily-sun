TEACHERS and staff members at Bantfwabethu Secondary School in Elukwatini, Mpumalanga, fear for their lives. This because gangs have turned the school into a war zone. Some staff members have allegedly even stopped going to school after the gangs threatened to kill them. One staff member said the gangs came to the school to settle scores with their rivals. They usually came on Fridays carrying knives and pangas. “Male teachers tried to intervene but they were threatened and warned not to interfere.” A video shot at the school showed some of the gang members harassing teachers. Two boys could be seen carrying knives and pangas. They also quarrelled with male teachers. The teachers said the gangs had made it difficult to instil rules and called for intervention from the education department. One parent, Martha Lushaba, said the issue had been a problem for years but recently got worse. “The school needs police visibility because this will have a negative impact on our children and their schoolwork,” she said. She also feared the gangs would continue to recruit their kids. “Young boys have been forced to be part of gangs. They’re harassed and bullied if they refuse.” Mpumalanga education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the department was disturbed by the incidents. He condemned this and urged police to apprehend the culprits. “The department will send a team of officials to establish the cause of the incident and render the required psychosocial support to those affected. “The team will also engage with the school management teams, governing body and other relevant stakeholders to find a lasting solution on safety measures.”
