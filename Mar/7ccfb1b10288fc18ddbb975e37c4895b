Pierre-Emerick
Aubameyang has been left out of the Arsenal starting XI to play Tottenham in
the north London derby after a disciplinary breach. Gunners boss
Mikel Arteta confirmed the news to Sky Sports ahead of the
game at the Emirates. Arteta refused to reveal the reasons behind his captain's
omission but did confirm he was originally scheduled to start in attack, with
Alexandre Lacazette getting the nod instead. We have drawn
the line, we move on, and he is on the bench," said Arteta. "We have a
process for every game that we have to respect. It was a decision made after
evaluating everything and who Auba is and what he's done. We have other players who can play. Recently we have changed
the team quite a lot and there are players who are willing to play and deserve
a chance, so I'm comfortable with that.
