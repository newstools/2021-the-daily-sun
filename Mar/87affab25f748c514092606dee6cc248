THE proceedings in the Omotoso case ended dramatically on Thursday, 11 March, with pastor Timothy Omotoso holding a Bible with a smile on his face. His defence Advocate Peter Dauberman has, on numerous occasions, asked for the case to be struck from the roll. Omotoso, the leader of Jesus Dominion International Ministries and his co-accused Lusanda Solani and Zukiswa Sitho, are facing 97 charges of rape, sexual assault and racketeering. The case in the Gqeberha High Court was postponed for judgment on Monday. There was confusion as presiding Judge Irma Schoeman was not present. It was the second time she had not attended court as she was also not available on Wednesday. Douberman has claimed that some of the witnesses were contradicting themselves and changing their statements. Douberman told Daily Sun: “I am not allowed to speak to the media, however I smell victory. Come on Monday and see for yourself.” A member of the church said: “God hears our prayers and God has exposed them. On Monday, the prophet will be free after four years.” Spokeswoman for the NPA Advocate Anelisa Ngcakani said: “We believe we have a strong case against Omotoso. The defence is playing delaying tactics and we have objected to their methods.”
