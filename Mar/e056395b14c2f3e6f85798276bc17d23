KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt said they expect a different team in their Caf Champions League group match against Petro de Luanda. The match will take place on Tuesday at the 11 de November Stadium in Angola at 6pm. Amakhosi will be eyeing maximum points to keep their dream of qualifying for the competition's quarterfinals. "We know the Petro team we faced in Johannesburg will be different from the one we will be facing today, so we need to be prepared," said Hunt before the match. "The Champions League is different from our domestic league, teams are generally similar home and away and you know what to expect; but in the Champions League, home games are very different from away games â€“ it's like facing two different teams." Chiefs are heading to this clash, sitting third in their Group C with four points after three games. Hunt says he would like to win two of the remaining three games for a chance to qualify for the quarter-finals of this season's competition. "I believe 10 points will give us a chance to qualify, so we need to go for maximum points today," he stated. Amakhosi will welcome back Samir Nurkovic and Ramahlwe Mphahlele, who missed the first leg encounter against Petro for this encounter. Nurkovic was out due to an injury, and Mphahlele was serving a suspension. Hunt added: "It is good to have Samir back, even though he is not a 100% fit. We need to manage him because he is our only available striker with Khama Billiat and Leonardo Castro out at the moment. "The forward line has been problematic with Nurkovic missing the first round of the season and now Billiat out for almost half the season. We now have Castro out and it has affected us." "Rama's presence is key because he's one of the most experienced campaigners in the competition. He understands the conditions and knows what's needed so it's good to have him back and available for selection."
