THE Post Office has warned customers about a new 419 scam. This comes after it was approached by members of the public who received emails trying to convince them to transfer money to fraudsters. Spokesman Johan Kruger confirmed to Daily Sun an email had been sent out, telling customers a parcel was being held back because customs fees were outstanding. “The notice entices them to click on a link that leads them to a website, where they can make a payment to release the fictitious parcel,” said Kruger. “The email includes a parcel number generated by the post office. Although the sender appears to be ‘ZA-Post Office’, the actual email address is in Morocco. “Members of the public who’ve received the notice should delete it immediately. “If there are custom fees, they can pay them when they collect the parcel. The post office does not require any payment before collection.” Kruger also encouraged members of the public who have information about postal crimes to contact the toll-free crime buster number, on 0800 020 070.
