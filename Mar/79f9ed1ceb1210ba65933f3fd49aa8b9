THE TENANTS contributed money to buy some beers. They returned to the yard in Phomolong in Sharpeville, south of Joburg, to chill and chat. BUT they couldn’t enjoy the drinks as a fight broke out INSTEAD! It all ended in excruciating pain for Salamina Hlumbane when acid was thrown on her face and upper body, allegedly by the mastandi. Salamina regrets renting from the woman after she was scarred by the acid. She said the incident started when the mastandi accused the tenants of robbing her on 20 February. “We were in the yard when we decided to buy beers. We contributed money,” she said. “After we bought the booze the mastandi said R200 was missing.” The 30-year-old said the mastandi turned on her when she spoke up for the uncle. “She said I knew where her money was. We had a verbal fight, which led to her beating me up. I left with my siblings after the fight,” she said. Just when Salamina thought the fight was over, the mastandi poured acid on her. “I was about to remove laundry from the washing line when she poured acid on me. I felt my body burn from the acid. “My siblings called my parents and told them what had happened. An ambulance took me to Kopanong Hospital.” She said the mastandi ruined her life! “I can’t even look in the mirror without crying. I wasn’t born like this,” she said. “I was meant to register for my NQF level course but couldn’t. I can’t leave the house.” She said her two kids are now scared of her. “None of them wants to come close. The little one is worse. She refuses to be carried by me. She cries when she sees me,” she said. The day of the incident was her child’s birthday, but she couldn’t celebrate with her. “My child thought I was going to buy cake, only to end up in hospital burnt and ruined. I want justice to prevail,” she said. Gauteng Provincial cop spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of assault with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm was opened. “The suspect has been arrested,” he said.
