Black Leopards and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) will renew their rivalry in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal match at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 6pm CAT. Leopards are wounded after recording their third consecutive defeat in the DStv Premiership when they were thrashed 3-1 by TS Galaxy in their most recent match. Lidoda Duvha are looking to reach the semifinals for the first time since 2011, having defeated AmaZulu FC 1-0 in the last 16 on February 2. Kostadin Papic, the Leopards head coach, says they will have to find a way to defeat Tshakhuma without several Lidoda Duvha players including the suspended Sibusiso Khumalo. "Yes, we are looking forward to the cup game. We are going off a defeat in midweek," Papic said. "We will be without several players due to various reasons, but we will try our best to get a positive result." Meanwhile, Tshakhuma are winless in their last two matches in the DStv Premiership having succumbed to a 2-1 defeat to Lamontville Golden Arrows in midweek. Vhadau Vha Damani are hoping to advance to the semifinals for the first time in the club's history and they reached the quarterfinals after defeating Swallows FC 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 draw. Mpho Maleka, the Tshakhuma assistant coach, says his charges should keep their head up and continue fighting ahead of their encounter against Leopards. "The guys showed character [against Arrows]. The only thing we need to do now is to tell the players that they need to keep their head up and do what we have been doing," Maleka said. "Otherwise the guys fought hard and showed character. We cannot blame them. We have to tell them that the journey doesn't end today. We have to continue fighting." -SuperSport
