HE was on night patrol when he decided to make a quick stop at his house. This was not something Jabu Mbongo did usually, but something led him to his home, which changed his life forever. “I found my partner sleeping with another man in our bed. I was overwhelmed with emotions and shot them. I don’t know what happened. It was dark.” Jabu was confessing his crimes during a church service at National Ethiopian Christian Fellowship Church in Evaton, Vaal, yesterday. He formed part of a group of former prisoners from Groenpunt Correctional Services invited to the church to share their stories. Jabu told congregants he tried to run away after the incident, but was arrested.  “The court found me guilty and sentenced me to 18 years imprisonment. I was in prison for nine years and was released on parole in July,” he said. Zakade Mxuthu said he was sentenced to 47 years and six months for murder and robbery. “I committed the crime I was sentenced for. I grew up on a farm and witnessed the bad things that happened to my parents by the apartheid regime. “The things made me angry and made me look at some people (oppressors) differently.” He became political and ended up doing military training outside the country at the age of 15. When he came back, he spoke to people who were treated badly during apartheid and they formed a team which targeted a white man who allegedly treated people badly.  “Our aim was to take his guns and money, but he wanted to fight. When he refused, I put a bullet in his head and we took the guns and money,” he said. Bishop Wami Nhlapho said the service formed part of a programme to integrate prisoners into the community. “We saw it fit that they should come to church and get spiritual counselling,” he said.
