AMAZULU are a team on the up. The KwaZulu Natal outfit continued their fine form under Benni McCarthy with a 1-0 win over Chippa United in their DStv Premiership clash at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Wednesday. Tapelo Xoki, not for the first time this season, was the match-winner for McCarthy’s side as they bagged their eighth win of the season. Usuthu have been a different side since the arrival of the former Cape Town City coach and look determined to meet the lofty standards set by their new chairman Sandile Zungu. A top-four finish is now looking more likely under the stewardship of the demanding McCarthy who was recently named as the coach of the month for January/February. The resurgent Usuthu under the guidance of the Cape Town-born coach picked up 15 points, scored 11 goals and kept three clean sheets in their eight games played in January and February. And they have picked up from where they left off, extending their unbeaten run in the league to nine matches. The result against the Chilli Boys saw Usuthu go level on points with Swallows FC on 31 points from 19 matches. However, they remain in sixth spot on the Premiership table.In the league, Usuthu hasn’t lost since going down 1-0 to Kaizer Chiefs in the second week of January. They came into the clash on the back of another 1-0 win over title challenger SuperSport United last time out. The Chilli Boys, on the other hand, are now winless in their last six matches in the league. They find themselves getting dragged into the relegation zone as they occupy 14 spot with 16 points from 19 matches. They next turn their attention to the Nedbank Cup with a clash against Richards Bay at the same venue on Saturday (3.30 pm). Usuthu next face Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in the league on 21 March at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium.
