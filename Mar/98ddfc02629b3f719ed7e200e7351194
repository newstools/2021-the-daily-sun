FORMER president Jacob Zuma and many dignitaries are expected to visit Khethomthandayo
Royal Palace to mourn Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Zulu Royal House spokesman Prince
Mbonisi Zulu confirmed that Zuma will come to mourn with the Zulu Royal House
in Nongoma, KZN. “Yes, he called us saying he will
come personally to mourn with the Royal Family after the death of the king. We
are still expecting more dignitaries and many people to come and mourn with us. “Yesterday as Zulu royal princes we
gathered to mourn and comfort each other. Today we will also gather and comfort
those who will come to mourn with us during this tough time,” he said. Zuma had a good relationship with
the king. He attended many cultural festivals and activities hosted by the king
at Nongoma royal palaces like the Reed Dance ceremony.
