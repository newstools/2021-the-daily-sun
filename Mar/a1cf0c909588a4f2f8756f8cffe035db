WITH great power comes great responsibility. Thatâ€™s something a Ferrari F8 Tributo driver learnt the hard way. The 43-year-old driver of the F8 Tributo picked up the keys to his brand-new Italian exotic after patiently waiting in line for more than a year to receive it, but just six hours later, he crashed it. The crash completely destroyed the front end of the car. According to Carscoops, the police said that the Ferrari was fitted with summer tyres and was driven on wet roads at the time of the crash. The car initially slammed into a concrete barrier on the side of the road, ripping off one of the rear wheels in the process. The Ferrari then slammed into a minibus before striking a guard rail and came to a rest on the side of the highway. Luckily, the driver was not injured but his passenger was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
