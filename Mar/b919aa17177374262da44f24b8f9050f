ALL he could do was watch as his business burnt down to the ground. There were no bodies in the building when his mortuary, 4 U Tombstones & Funeral Services in Katlehong, burnt down on Monday. His staff were also not in the building at the time of the incident. “Thank God there were no bodies. The last body went out on Sunday, 28 February. So there was nothing in the fridge. “Imagine where I’d be if there’d been bodies inside. How was I going to face the angry people who were going to come here looking for their loved one’s bodies?” The fridge, which accommodates 18 bodies, burnt to ashes. “I risked my life to take one of the hearses out,” he said.  He suspected an electrical problem to be behind the fire. “I’m thinking it was an electrical fault, which started on Monday before staff reported for duty. The wiring was done by professionals. It was a fire from nowhere,” he said. He has branches around Katlehong and directs some of the work to them. He told Daily Sun his heart bled for the expensive coffins lost in the flames. “That one hurts me. They are all gone. Right now I want to buy a sound system.” He was also worried files of people with burial societies burnt down as well. He said the building that burnt down was the head office where all the paperwork was stored. Emergency services spokesman, William Ntladi, confirmed there were no bodies at the mortuary. No injures were reported.
