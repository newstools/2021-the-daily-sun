MPUMALANGA police have launched a massive manhunt for four suspects who allegedly shot and killed a police sergeant. The deceased (43), attached to Calcutta vispol police, was shot while driving his Golf 6 at Gamotibidi Trust outside Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Friday night. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the deceased was driving with his girlfriend when they were stopped by four armed suspects who instructed him to open his window. “They demanded a firearm and cellphone before he could respond. A gunshot was fired and hit him on the hand and body. They pulled both occupants out of the vehicle and threw them on ground before the suspects fled the scene. “Paramedics certified him dead on arrival and his motor vehicle was later recovered at Violet Bank. The deceased’s companion wasn’t harmed. “A case of car hijacking and murder was opened and a manhunt has been launched for the suspects. We want to request members of the public to help with information that can lead to arrests to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111. “Alternatively, the public can send information via the MySAPS app which can be downloaded on any smartphone. All information will be treated as confidential and callers may opt to remain anonymous,” said Hlathi.
