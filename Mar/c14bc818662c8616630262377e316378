PUBLIC figures in KZN have come out to say the SABC should bring back suspended Ukhozi FM presenter, Khathide “Tshatha” Ngobe. Among these figures is Pastor Vusi Dube, DA leader Zwakele Mncwango and former Ukhozi FM presenter Ngizwe Mchunu. They vented on social media, saying Tshatha would’ve given deceased Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini a befitting tribute. Dube and Mncwango even went as far as creating an online petition. Dube said Ukhozi presenters failed to give the king a befitting tribute, except Dudu Khoza who did well in honouring the king. “Their decisions affect us as listeners. We believe they’d have known the importance of bringing back Tshatha during this mourning period if they appreciated us,” said Dube. MENZI NGUBANE HAS PASSED ON! He said when he listened to Ukhozi shows, they lacked the feeling that the Zulu nation had lost a king. “Their programmes should’ve been clear that we’re in mourning. Tshatha has rich knowledge of the history of the Zulu nation. He’d have done an exceptional job,” said Dube. SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said Tshatha remained unscheduled on Ukhozi FM until the end of this month. “The SABC respects the views of all its audiences and stakeholders and would like to be provided with the opportunity to deal with internal matters according to its HR policies and processes. The decision to unschedule Ngobe is a valid one and should be respected,” she said. Ukhozi station manager Sbongi Ngcobo as well as Tshatha’s phones rang unanswered.
