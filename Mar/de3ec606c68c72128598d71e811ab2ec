KAIZER Chiefs are desperate to carry their winning momentum from the Caf Champions League into the DStv Premiership. Amakhosi defeated Angolan outfit Petro de Luanda 2-0 at the weekend to return to winning ways and ease the mounting pressure on coach Gavin Hunt. They now hope to do the same when they return to league action with a clash against Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow (6pm). Chiefs have lost more matches than they have won at this stage and find themselves in an unfamiliar position. They have collected a mere 19 points from 17 matches, and are four points away from the top eight. Hunt will be aware that a turnaround is long overdue if the Glamour Boys are to redeem themselves and finish the season strongly. “We are obviously falling behind in the league,” said Hunt. “Teams below us are winning, so we have a big game against Maritzburg, and we need points to get ourselves in a better position. “It’s not going to be easy going down there. That’s for sure.” The Team of Choice have become a bogey team for Chiefs in recent times with the Kwa-Zulu Natal team having a knack of pulling off an upset. Maritzburg shocked Chiefs 2-0 in the reverse fixture played at the FNB Stadium in January, with Judas Moseamedi scoring a brace. Coach Ernst Middendorp, who got the better of his former team in their first meeting earlier this season, will be looking to complete a stunning double. But Hunt will hope to end Maritzburg’s recent success against the Soweto giants. The former Bidvest Wits mentor is desperate to put Chiefs’ troubles behind them in a season that has seen them struggle. “We never had a lot of players,” added Hunt. “We had to play a few players out of position, and they did okay.”
