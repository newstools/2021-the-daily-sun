A cash-in-transit guard was robbed by having explosives strapped to them. This is on the same level as urban terrorism. A suicide bomber operates in exactly the same way. When al-Qaeda was a problem in the early 2000s, what was the response? They were assassinated. Maybe it is time for the death penalty to be reinstated. These are not kasi boys stealing for the thrill. These are organised terrorists. Calitzdorp
