SINAZO Mfanelo had to carry her dead newborn baby in her arms for over six hours. Nurses at Nontyatyambo Community Clinic in Mdantsane, in East London in the Eastern Cape, allegedly refused to admit her. They allegedly told her they couldn’t help her as the baby died at home. The 29-year-old told Daily Sun her nightmare started on Sunday, 7 March when she felt pain. She said: “I called my boyfriend Thulani Balani so we could go to the clinic. They gave us painkillers and told us to go home.” But Sinazo, who was five months pregnant, felt the same pain again on Monday, 8 March. “I felt this terrible pain below my belly and couldn’t stand it,” she said. “I went back to Nontyantyambo at about 4am and nurses told me there was nothing they could do because there were no doctors. “I was told to wait until 9am, but I waited at home. I ended up giving birth at Thulani’s home, but the baby wasn’t breathing.” The couple rushed to Nontyantyambo, but nurses allegedly told them Sinazo couldn’t be admitted as the baby died at home. Thulani said nurses told them all they could do was to clean up Sinazo. “The nurses said they only cared for people who died in hospital. “They said we should report the death at the police station and call a funeral parlour for the baby.” Carrying the baby in Sinazo’s arms, the couple tried to report the incident at Vulindlela cop shop. But cops couldn’t help them. “We went back home and contacted a nurse my mum knows at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital, and she asked us to bring the baby to the hospital. We eventually got help,” he said. Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said he’d refer the matter to customer care for investigation.
