PRETORIA Callies assistant coach Sly Mosala has quit the club!  Mosala will take up the position of the second in command to McDonald Makhubedu at fellow GladAfrica Championship outfit Sekhukhune United, the club have confirmed.  Together with head coach Sammy Troughton, Mosala guided Callies to the National First Division last season and it seems his influence hasnâ€™t gone unnoticed in the lower division.  Mosala bags tons of experience as an assistant coach, having previously held a similar position at University of Pretoria and Free State Stars.
