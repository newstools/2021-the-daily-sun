Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has found Orlando Pirates a difficult opponent down the years, and will be seeking to improve his win ratio when he leads his side in the Soweto Derby at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Hunt has met Pirates on 61 previous occasions as a coach and claimed victory in 19 of those games, a 31 per cent win percentage that he will hope to drive up in the coming years at Chiefs. It has not started well for him, with the AmaKhosi having lost all three previous encounters against their great Soweto rivals this season, but Saturday brings another opportunity to change that. Hunt’s most successful time against Pirates by far was while with Bidvest Wits, when he secured nine wins and three draws in 19 matches for a win ratio of 47.4 per cent. It is the only club where he has won more games against Pirates than he has lost (seven). He won exactly a third of matches while at SuperSport United, six from 18 encounters, and three from 13 (23.1 per cent) at Moroka Swallows. He managed a draw and a defeat in his only season at Black Leopards in 2001-02, while at Hellenic he secured one win in six games (16.7 per cent). Hunt’s overall record against Pirates in all competitions reads 19 wins, 17 draws and 25 defeats in his 61 games. -SuperSport
