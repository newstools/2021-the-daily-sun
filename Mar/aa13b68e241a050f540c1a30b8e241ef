SGB election season is upon us. How I wish the Department of Basic Education and MPs could take this matter seriously. Those who sit in these powerful bodies are self-serving and don’t have pupils’ interests at heart. There are talks of rent-a-crowd incidents to help candidates get elected.  Corruption is rife, to an extent that they solicit bribes for promotional posts.  SGBs are powerful yet most of their members are illiterate. Schools are the only institutions where non-professionals make decisions that affect the teaching profession. Letter by Baloyi MHHammanskraal
