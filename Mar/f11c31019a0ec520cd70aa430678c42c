BAFANA Bafana captain Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo is ready to lead fellow troops out for battle. Bafana will lock horns with Sudan in a crunch Afcon qualifier at Khartoum International Stadium on Sunday (6pm). It’s all to play for with a spot in next year’s Afcon up for grabs for both sides in their final qualifier. The final spot in Group C is up for grabs with Ghana having grabbed the other one a few days ago. Bafana, who head into the encounter in a favourable position as they only need a point, will look to get the job done. They are hoping to qualify for back-to-back Afcon tournaments having managed to qualify for the last edition held in Egypt. Bafana are on ten points and sit in second place behind Ghana who top the group thanks to their superior head-to-head. But Sudan are still very much in it as they are only a solitary point behind Bafana and need a win to qualify. But Hlatshwayo insists they have no intentions of giving their opponents a sniff. “We as the players are the ones who have to go out there and do the job on the field,” said Hlatshwayo. “We know how important this game is, it’s the decider and the last game of the group. The winner takes all. “As a country, as a team and as players we are expecting to win.”
