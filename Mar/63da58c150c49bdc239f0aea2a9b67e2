A FATHER needs help to get his daughter’s alleged rapist and killer arrested. Zacharia Tsotetsi is determined to get justice for his daughter Dieketseng (40) after she was raped, murdered and buried in the backyard, allegedly by a family friend. Zacharia from Tumahole, Free State, said the suspect lived at his brother’s place, and he trusted him. “He was supposed to fetch something at my place on 22 January, but didn’t show up. I checked in on him, but he wasn’t home,” he said. “Neighbours told me he was digging in the backyard when they last saw him. “They thought he was digging a hole for rubbish, but the rubbish was still there.”  Zacharia said a fridge and TV were missing, which he reported to the police. “I also alerted the police to the digging and they told me to check it myself. I did and found a body covered in a sheet,” said Zacharia. He called the police, but had no idea the body was his daughter’s until forensics arrived. “I’m in so much pain. And him roaming the streets makes things worse.” Zacharia said the suspect was allegedly on the run. “A friend told me the man plans to flee the country. We can’t let that happen.” Free State police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said a case of murder was opened. “The suspect is on the run. Anyone with information should call Detective Sergeant Andre Jacobs on 082 465 3140.”
