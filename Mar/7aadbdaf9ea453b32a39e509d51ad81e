HE loved his job as a braai man and died saving his customers’ meat. Siyanda Ngcobo (30) was stabbed to death on Saturday during an argument with three men who stole meat while he was cooking it at Vukuzame Butchery in K section of KwaMashu, north of Durban. Witnesses said Siyanda caught them but they ran away. He ran after them and was stabbed outside the butchery. His brother Mduduzi (37) said he was about to start his night shift at the same butchery when he was told to rush there as Siyanda had been stabbed. “I found him lying on the ground in a passage. He tried to speak to me but failed. I got to the road and screamed for help. A passing van stopped and took us to the local clinic,” he said. Mduduzi said nurses tried to save his brother’s life. “It’s still like a dream to me. I don’t believe it. We were close and always together. We were like twins,” he said. Mduduzi said his brother was a brave person and chased the men. Butchery manager Thabiso Cele said he was called to rush to the scene as one of his staffers had been stabbed. “I drove to the scene, and when I arrived I was told they’d already taken him to the local hospital. I went to the hospital but discovered he’d died on arrival. I then informed his family,” said Thabiso. He said although he was stabbed outside the butchery, they will help the cops with the footage to see the people he had an argument with before he was stabbed. Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was opened. “The victim sustained stab wounds to the back and was taken to a local clinic, where he died,” she said. Gwala said the matter is under investigation.
