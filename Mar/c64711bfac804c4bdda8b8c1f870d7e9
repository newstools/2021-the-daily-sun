CHRISTIAN activist Solomon Ashoms has lashed out at churches that engage in criminal activities. Solomon told Daily Sun that churches have become a good base to do crime. The founder of the Movement Against Abuse in Churches has been creating awareness through his YouTube channel. He said he had been interacting with members of various churches who had been victims of crimes, including rape. Solomon said rape, financial abuse, money laundering and human trafficking were among the top crimes in churches. “People need to be wiser and look beyond taverns and the streets. Churches are not often suspected as scenes of crime; they have become a good cover for fake pastors,” he said. Solomon said people often went to church because they were suffering, which made them vulnerable. However, he said some church members continued to support pastors even after they were arrested. He said although many people were getting fed up, not all victims were brave enough to speak up, especially if they had been raped. “They are ashamed and scared of being judged. Others don’t believe they have a chance of winning a case against their pastors because they believe they are powerful. It’s very sad when family members don’t believe them.” Solomon said an increase in arrests might lead to fewer people attending church. ALSO READ: KILLER
DAD, I DID IT! “Those who continue going to church will take responsibility for their own religion by not taking every word their pastor says as the truth. “They will rather read the Bible to look for scriptures relevant to their problems because we all need a relationship with God,” he said. Solomon warned churchgoers to be careful of pastors who preached a lot about miracles and money instead of patience, hard work and obedience.
