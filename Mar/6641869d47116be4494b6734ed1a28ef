ORLANDO Pirates midfielder Ben Motshwari is as hard as nails on the pitch. But off it, the 29-year-old is a soft-spoken family man. He enjoys spending time with his young family whenever he can escape his hectic schedule with the Soweto giants. He was happy to return from a Caf Confederation Cup trip to Ghana with the Bucs to spend more time with his young daughter. “Where's there's lasting love there's family,” Motshwari captioned a lovely picture of his young family. “Surround yourself with important individuals that will be there and support you regardless of the obstacles. With family, you'll never go wrong.  La Familia.” A post shared by Ben Motshwari (@motshwari06)
