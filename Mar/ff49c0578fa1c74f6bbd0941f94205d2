WHAT do Eastetr and Christmas have in common? Biblically, they both place Jesus Christ at the forefront despite their different narratives. However, both set of holidays offer an invaluable opportunity for families to spend time together and indulge in some good food. While Christmas is often associated with foods such as turkey and gammon, Easter cannot be Easter without the following on your menu: 1. Fish According to Christian teachings, Jesus died on a Friday. Fasting on Fridays became a way to honour his sacrifice. Fish, which is cold-blooded, was considered okay to eat on fasting days. 2. Hot Cross Buns The cross on top of these fruit buns is a symbol of the crucifixion – which is why they’re traditionally eaten on Good Friday. In Tudor times, it’s thought that fruit buns were limited to treats for special occasions such as Easter. This is why this has become a common base for the cross, which is made with a simple flour and water mixture. 3. Chocolate Eggs Chocolate Easter eggs are now one of the most common symbols of Easter. First created in the 19th century, the real developments in the creation of chocolate eggs came with the experiments made by the Cadbury Brothers in the 1870s. 4. Roasted Lamb Often served on Easter Sunday, Lamb is referenced in quite a few Christian stories and has become linked with Easter due to the reference of Jesus being the sacrificial Lamb of God. This tasty meat is also associated with spring time, thanks to lots of lambs being born in the spring.
