IT feels good to be doing what I love! These were the words of former Baroka FC striker Ranga Chivaviro after making his debut in the Kosovo Superleague for KF Trepca '89 in a 2-0 defeat against Ballkani on Sunday. Chivaviro made a name for himself in the GladAfrica Championship before joining Baroka at the start of the 2018-19 season. However, he failed to make an impact with Bakgaga as he spent most of his time on loan at TS Sporting before his contract was terminated last year. Last Tuesday, the 28-year-old signed a short-term deal with the European side. “It feels really good to be doing what I love, especially after such a long time without participating in an official match,” Chivaviro told SunSport. He had last played in March last year, just before the Covid-19 pandemic stopped football in South Africa. “I joined the team last Tuesday and I made my debut on Sunday,” Chivas, as he was affectionately known, revealed. He hopes to regain his form and help the team finish the season in a respectable position to increase his chances of getting an improved deal at the end of the season. He said: “We are in the middle of the season already and I want to contribute to the club's success.” Chivaviro and former Maritzburg United defender Mphakamiseni Nene, who has also signed for the same team, are the first South African players to ply their trade in Kosovo.
