TSHIVENDA traditional singer Sikheli Junior has released his best album yet. The singer whose real name is Joseph Nengudza released A Li Ngo Lala, which he claims is the best of all his albums, late last year. Speaking to SunBuzz, the musician from Tshifudi Village in the Vhembe district in Limpopo told us more about the album. “I’ve worked on many projects before, but none of them come close to this one. I worked on this album alone,” he said. “I had time to make it into everything I wanted it to be. People also love it. “I’ve been getting great comments from people who say the quality of the album is great. It has also motivated me to make more great music.” Sikheli said the album was also meant to guide people. “What motivated me to work on this project was the way life was last year. There are a lot of things that aren’t fixed in our lives because we don’t take them seriously,” he said.

I always undermined myself. “That is why I hadn’t taken it upon myself to sing. But he gave me courage to go to studio. “That’s when I released my first album, Ladzani Shango, in 2012.” This album went on to win a Satma for Best TshiVenda Album. Sikheli is working on his seventh album. “I have my own studio. So I’m always working on new music. I’m working on another project. “But I won’t release it this year. I want to push A Li Ngo Lala.”
