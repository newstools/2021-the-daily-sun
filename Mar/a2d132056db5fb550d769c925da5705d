FOLLOWING the backlash MultiChoice received for lack of diversity in the cast of Love Island SA, the company has promised to be more diverse with the local adaptation of the hugely popular reality show Temptation Island SA. MultiChoice lost its main sponsor Lotto Star, that pulled out as a result of the backlash and bad publicity the show got. However, with the launch of Temptation Island SA, Showmax has vowed to do things differently this time around.

The many channels and thousands of programme hours we produce are testament to this, if you look at recent TV shows, from Somizi and Mohale: The Union to Life With Kelly Khumalo, Lebo M – Coming Home and Living The Dream With Somizi,” said Showmax head of content Candice Fangueiro. She said Temptation Island SA would start in the first half of the year, and entrants needed to be over 21 years old and permanent residents of South Africa.
