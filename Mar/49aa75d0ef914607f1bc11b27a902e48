THE Public Service Commission has called on government to ensure the procurement of the Covid-19 vaccine is corruption free. Briefing the media in Tshwane yesterday, commissioner Micheal Seloane said corruption was a hindrance to development in society. Seloane was briefing the media on the Pulse of the Public Service Bulletin covering the period 1 October 2020 to 31 December 2020. Briefing focused on governance matters in the public service relating to managing reporting lines and hybrid working arrangements due to Covid-19. “Non-payment of government suppliers within 30 days, overall number of complaints and grievances handled by the PSC up to 31 December 2020 are also reported on, as well as implementation of the financial disclosure framework,” he said. Seloane said the overall number of registered grievances handled by the commission up to the end of December 2020 was 521. “Of the 521 grievances, 134 were not properly referred and 387 were properly referred. “The grievances which were not properly referred are those that are either being dealt with elsewhere, such as bargaining councils, and those that are still not finalised in the departments.” Seloane called on unions to play an active role in helping their members lodge grievances and advise them accordingly when the timeframe for lodging grievances has lapsed. “Of the 387 cases referred to the PSC, about 95% are referred by employees and 5% by executive authorities. Referral of grievances by employees is an indication that departments have failed to resolve these grievances internally within the prescribed timeframe,” he said.
