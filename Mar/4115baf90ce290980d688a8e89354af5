FORMER Generations actor Thabiso Mokhethi and his wife Gaaratwe have decided to go their separate ways. But Thabiso didn’t want to reveal what led to the split. “We’re working to find amicable ways to co-parent our three kids. “What we’re doing is for our kids. We’ll continue to get along and there’s nothing I can do if my wife feels like moving on without me,” said Thabiso. He said it was painful as he loved his wife very much.

I’m going through a painful experience, but I don’t overlook the fact that there are kids who need me to be strong for them during this difficult time.” He said it was his wife who decided to leave their marriage and house. “We’re working out the details of how I’ll be able to see my kids.” In a previous interview, Thabiso admitted to beating his wife while he was fighting depression and on drugs after losing his mum and brother in a crash. But they made up. Gaaratwe said: “We’ve tried to make it work and find ways of dealing with the things that were causing a break down in our marriage, but we couldn’t. “Our only priority now is to find a way to co-parent and be the best parents to them. A lot has happened during our marriage and I believe when the things that made you fall in love with someone are no longer there, you leave. We tried our best, but it just didn’t work out.”
