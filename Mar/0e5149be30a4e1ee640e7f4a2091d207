STELLENBOSCH FC are hoping to become the first team to stop the Mamelodi Sundowns juggernaut. The Cape Winelands outfit will be looking to make it third time lucky against Sundowns this season after they lost the last two meetings. They were thumped 3-0 in their first-round league meeting before going down 3-2 in the Nedbank Cup Round of 32. But Steve Braker’s Stellies are confident that they can pull off an upset this time around and end Downs’ unbeaten run in the league this season. The Tshwane giants are yet to lose a game in all competitions since their 1-0 defeat to Bloemfontein Celtic in the MTN8 at the beginning of the season. “I think we are looking forward to the game,” said Barker. “It is always nice to play against the best team in South Africa and one of the best on the continent. “It allows individuals and the team to gauge where we are. We are an ambitious club that wants to achieve what Sundowns is achieving in the future. “It is a great benchmark and we respect them a lot. We recently played them in the Nedbank Cup where we did give them a good run for their money. “We also showed last season that we can compete. We have to show the right form and courage against a team like Sundowns which we will do. “We are at home and have good momentum after the last two matches. We also have our own qualities and I’m sure that we can ask a few questions as well.”
