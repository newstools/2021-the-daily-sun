KAIZER Chiefs have finally managed to register their first victory in the Caf Champions League group stages. Despite not having their key strikers Samir Nurkovic and Leonardo Castro, Amakhosi managed to score two goals to defeat Petro de Luanda 2-0 on Saturday night. Nurkovic and Castro were out due to injuries. That saw Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt starting with Bernard Parker and Lazarous Kambole upfront, while shot-stopper Daniel Akpeyi took Itumeleng Khune, who is out on compassionate leave. Eric Mathoho broke the deadlock on the half-hour mark, towering above everyone else inside the box to powerfully head home a Nkosingiphile Ngcobo corner. Petro, who had barely tested keeper Daniel Akpeyi in the opening half, had a rare chance 10 minutes after the break, but Augusto Domingos saw his shot deflected to take the sting off the power and enable an easy catch for the keeper. Happy Mashiane wrapped up the win for Amakhosi with 11 minutes before time with a low strike into the bottom corner after some individual brilliance. That victory sees Chiefs sit third in the group with four points, level second-placed Horoya, who face group leaders Wydad Casablanca later in the evening. 90 + 2’| #CHI 2 : 0 #APLFull time score: (Mathoho 30’, Mashiane 79’) Kaizer Chiefs 2 : 0 Atlético Petróleos de Luanda #KCOneTeam #CAFCL #Amakhosi4Life pic.twitter.com/I23RkeGeEg
