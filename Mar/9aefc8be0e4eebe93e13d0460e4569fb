A WOMAN says her husband allegedly turned their home into a wrestling ring, with her as his opponent. The 44-year-old from Sekampaneng in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, told Daily Sun her husband lifted her up and threw her onto the floor on Tuesday, 9 March. She claims while she was lying on the floor in agony, he screamed as if he’d just won a fight. The traumatised woman said before throwing her to the ground, her hubby allegedly beat her with his fists and kicked her around. The woman said her husband became angry because she didn’t greet him when she returned home at night after visiting friends. She claimed he has been physically abusing her since 1997. “Whenever he beats me he lifts me up and throws me like he’s fighting a wrestler,” she said. She told the SunTeam she feared he’d one day kill her. “My husband would come to me in the middle of the night and expect me to wake up, kneel down and greet him,” she said. She said she didn’t love her husband anymore but was scared he’d kill her if she told him. She went to stay with a friend after the last beating. “He’d sometimes bring food and eat in front of the family alone. I’ve been living a life of hell since 1997,” she said. A neighbour said the woman came to her house after the last beating and told her she was scared her husband would kill her. “I don’t stand with men who abuse their wives. I feel really sad about her situation,” she said. Sergeant Herman Moremi said a case of common assault was opened. He said police were told the husband beat his wife, saying she was disrespectful. “The suspect was arrested and appeared in court.” he said.
