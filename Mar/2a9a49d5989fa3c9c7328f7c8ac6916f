Photos of a tombstone for a flamboyant businessman and promoter have sent social media into a frenzy. The businessman, Kudzanai Kangara, was buried in January after he died of Covid-19. He reportedly had Covid-19 symptoms, including shortness of breath. Photos of Kangara’s tombstone shared by African Curators on Twitter show the businessman’s huge monument, which is housed by a flashy, mirror-like structure that seems to have cost quite a fortune. According to The Zimbabwe Mail, Kangara was a wealthy man who had a fleet of luxury cars, several houses, and three wives.
