A
22-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the hijacking of two
Eastern Cape police officers. The Hawks'
Serious Organised Crime team in Gqeberha arrested the man on Wednesday for his
role in the February incident in which the two New Brighton police officers
were hijacked in Kwazakhele. "Sergeant
Wongile Ntengo, 40, and Sergeant Sonwabile Litole, 31, were going about their
routine patrols when they were suddenly ambushed by four armed suspects whilst
they were talking to a civilian [in] the street. The four suspects reportedly
approached the marked police vehicle from all four doors and instructed the two
police officials to alight," said Hawks spokesperson Captain Yolisa
Mgolodela. Ntengo's
head and stomach were wounded and he is still receiving medical treatment. Both
officials were robbed of their service firearms, bulletproof gear, cellphones
and personal belongings. The men
drove off in the police vehicle, which was later found abandoned a short
distance away from the scene. SOURCE:
