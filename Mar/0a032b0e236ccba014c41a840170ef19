“HE might have been killed like a dog, but he will not be buried like one.” These were the words of EFF leader Julius Malema on Sunday, 14 March when he spoke outside the home of Mthokozisi Ntumba in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni. Mthokozisi was allegedly shot by cops during a student protest in Braamfontein, Joburg, last week. But he was not part of the protest. Malema promised his family the EFF would help them with the funeral. He said they’d make sure Mthokozisi received a dignified sendoff but assured the family they won’t take over the funeral. EFF members also showed up in large numbers and sang and danced outside the Ntumba home. After engaging with the family Malema said they were not coping. “What makes matters worse is that Bheki Cele came here and promised to help this family, but when they sent them the things they needed, they were asked if they had funeral policies,” said Malema. He said even if the money for polices was there, it could be used to take care of Mthokozisi’s children. “We’re going to be get them lawyers to sue the state. Our brother didn’t just take care of his immediate family, but also took care of his brothers and aunt. “You can see how people have lost out from his death. We want to make sure government pays a lot of money for killing an innocent soul,” he said. Details of Mthokozisi’s funeral have not been communicated, but it’s expected to take place in KZN.
