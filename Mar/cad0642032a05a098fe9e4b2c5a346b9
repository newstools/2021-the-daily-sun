TWO families are devastated after a man took his aunt and cousin hostage on Sunday, 28 March and killed them. Joel Masila (35) was killed by police after negotiations failed. He’d killed his aunt Joyce Moreroa (50) and his cousin Sarah Makwela (25) with his traffic cop brother’s service pistol. Joel apparently arrived at his cousin’s home in Mshongoville Village, Limpopo, parked his brother’s BMW in the yard, and left with Sarah. He took her to a nearby stream, shot her twice and left her for dead. Joel went to his aunt’s house in Ga-Matsea, outside Mankweng, and held Joyce and a 16-year-old relative hostage. It appears Joel had planned everything as a letter allegedly written by him was found in the house where the hostage drama unfolded. He wrote that he wanted to be cremated. “Cremate body. Life is too sweet and short, unjust, unfair, too much controversy.” Joyce’s husband Frans (54) said he couldn’t believe his eyes when he arrived home from Gauteng to find his wife lying dead in a pool of blood, her hands tied. “The other relative was very lucky to survive. He shot her in the hand. Police surrounded the house and disrupted the shooter, who managed to jump out a window. “I’m still shocked and don’t believe what has happened. “Joel was like a son to me. I previously found him a job as a machine operator, but he was retrenched.” Sarah’s sister Nkele Makwela (21) said they wanted Joel’s brother to be charged with negligence. “The gun was recklessly left inside the car, which anyone could’ve driven.” Sarah leaves behind three children and her father Jonas. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the tactical response team shot the suspect as he fired shots at them. “The motive for the taking of hostages has not been confirmed and investigations are continuing,” he said.
