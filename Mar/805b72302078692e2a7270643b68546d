Richard Mdluli’s troubles seem to be
piling up. Earlier today a warrant of arrest was
issued for the former crime intelligence boss for failure to appear at the
North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane. The matter has been postponed to 12 March
for the setting of a trial date. Mdluli was supposed to appear for charges
relating to the allegation of gross abuse of the police intelligence slush
fund. According to the Investigation
Directorate the charges include the payment of private trips to China and
Singapore, private use of witness protection houses, conversion of these
properties for personal use and the leasing of Mdluli’s private residence to
the state in order to pay his bond, among others. Judge Bam ruled that Mdluli was ordered
to appear and a request letter to be sent to the Department of Correctional
Services to bring him to court from prison where he is currently serving his
sentence in a separate matter. Bam stated that there was no reason why he could
not appear before court today. His co-accused Heine Barnard and Solomon
Lazarus appeared on charges of corruption, fraud, and theft. Heine faces an
additional charge of defeating the ends of justice. Mdluli is also serving a five year jail
term after he was sentenced by the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg earlier
this year for assault and kidnap in the Oupa Ramogibe case, dating back to the
1990s.
