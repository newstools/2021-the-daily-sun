PRETORIA Callies striker Thabiso Nkoana hopes his experience in the Nedbank Cup will carry his new side to the final. Nkoana helped the rejuvenated Callies beat Cape Town All Stars in the Ke Yona Cup quarter-finals in a penalty shoot-out after the teams were tied 2-2 after extra time at Danie Craven Stadium on Sunday. Callies, under coach Sammy Troughton, will now face Chippa United at home in the semi-final, with the date set to be confirmed by the PSL. The former University of Pretoria striker, who previously worked with Troughton at Stellenbosch FC, said it will mean a world if Callies can reach the Ke Yona Cup final in their first season in the Championship. “So far this is a good achievement and it’s a dream come true,” said Nkoana. “I think this is the first time for a team that was promoted from the ABC Motsepe League to reach this stage of the competition. Such moments come once in a lifetime and it’s a good opportunity for everyone to enjoy. “Callies are a very good team. But teams in the PSL always have an upper hand in terms of experience because they have been playing in this cup for a long time. But for us we are in the quarter-finals for the first time. so it is exciting times.” The 28-year-old striker, along with Callies teammate Atusaye Nyondo, won this cup with SuperSport United when the Tshwane giants beat their city rivals Mamelodi Sundowns in the 2012 final. “Some of us have won trophies in the PSL and I’m not the only one in the team. You look at Thabo Moloi (Telkom Knockout with SuperSport in 2014-15 season), Nyondo and Edwin Sitayitayi (won the TKO with Kaizer Chiefs in the 2010-11 season),” said Nkoana. Nkoana was at the heart of Callies’ promotion to the GladAfrica Championship last season. He won the Golden Boot award after scoring three goals in the ABC Motsepe League playoff stages.
