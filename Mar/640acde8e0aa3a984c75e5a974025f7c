Manqoba Mngqithi has been having “heart in mouth” moments ever since Peter Shalulile started banging in the goals for Mamelodi Sundowns.  The sight of Shalulile breaking into a freak celebration, jumping around before diving on the ground, has become quite common... and worrisome for his coach, Mngqithi.  The over-exuberant marksman was at it again after he netted Downs'late winner in their 2-1 league victory against Stellenbosch on Saturday.   Is this Peter Shalulile's best celebration yet, after netting a 95th-minute winner against Stellenbosch? ??#DStvPrem
