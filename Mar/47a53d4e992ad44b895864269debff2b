Four police officers arrested in connection with the murder of Mthokozisi Ntumba in Braamfontein earlier this month were granted bail in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Friday. Magistrate Sipho Sibanyoni granted the four accused bail of R8 000 each. Their bail conditions include that they cannot intimidate or make contact with witnesses and they may not apply for a passport or travel documents. Tshephisho Kekana, 27, Cidraas Motseothatha, 43, Madimetja Legodi, 37, and Victor Mohammed, 51, were arrested a few days after Ntumba was shot and killed allegedly by the accused while they were dispersing students who were protesting non-registration due to historical debt.

In their bail applications heard on Wednesday, all four accused officers pleaded with the court to grant bail, citing, among other things, that they were the sole breadwinners of their respective families. The State opposed bail. Kekana, Motseothatha, Legodi and Mohammed are facing charges of murder, attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice. SOURCE: NEWS24
