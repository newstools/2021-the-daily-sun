Dear MizzB I AM in a relationship with an amazing guy. The problem is that his sexual performance is not satisfying me. I’m afraid to tell him as I don’t want to hurt him. Would it be okay if I reconnected with my ex-boyfriend just for sex?              )Sista Dear Sista Communication is one of the most important elements that make a relationship to work. Many relationships fail due to lack of communication. Your partner can’t guess what makes you sexually satisfied. You need to tell him. Having sex with your ex is betrayal and cheating. Would you understand if your man were to do that to you? Be considerate and decide whether you want to put in efforts to make your relationship work. Whatever you decide, let him know so he can also find someone who deserves him. All the best!
