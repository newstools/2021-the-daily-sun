ANDILE Mpisane might be the youngest club chairman in professional football, but he has big goals for the KwaZulu-Natal GladAfrica Championship outfit Royal AM. However, he will not be hanging up his playing boots anytime soon. Mpisane said he cannot choose between being a player or being the boss administering the club. “Football has always been my passion and it has helped me realise that my preferred style of leadership is leading from the front, so for as long as I am still able and fit, I will continue playing for the team,” he said. “Before I took on this position, I took time and I think I have found my balance. When you want something badly, you make time for it. “For example, with the Championship happening, right now I have placed my focus on that and dedicated myself to the club.” He was only 19 when he was announced as the chairman of the club late last year and became the youngest club boss in the history of the Premier Soccer League. He turned 20 on Monday and plans to guide Royal AM into the DStv Premiership. He told SunSport: “Like every club, the Premiership is what we are working towards and as for when, it all depends on how the team performs.” On being in charge of a club at such a young age, Mpisane told SunSport: “I don’t want to lie, the position of being a chairman is a very challenging one, as there are many pressures that come with such authority. “But at the same time it has been exciting and I am grateful for the support and the help that I have been getting through it all. “It has not been easy as I thought it would be. “But I am fortunate to be working with a highly experience team whom I consider as my teachers and mentors. Basically, Royal AM FC is my university.”
