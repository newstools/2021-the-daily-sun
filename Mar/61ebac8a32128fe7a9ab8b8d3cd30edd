SOUTH Africans take 45 million trips mostly by foot. This was revealed by Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke when he released the National Household Travel Survey stats. He said yesterday that the travel survey gave insight into transport needs and behaviour, assessed attitudes towards transport, and how South Africans get to their workplaces, educational institutions and other places. The 2020 survey revealed that most households travelled to educational institutions. “Trips to a workplace were a second most common purpose for household members. The trips were predominant in the Western Cape with 37,4%, Gauteng with 31,1%, and KZN with 28,3%. “These proportions were much higher than the national proportion of 26,3%. ALSO READ: MECHANIC
