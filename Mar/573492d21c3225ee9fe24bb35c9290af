ORLANDO Pirates are ready to secure a spot in the knockout stages of Caf Confederation Cup. Bucs take a trip to Libya where they will face Al-Ahly Benghazi on Sunday. A win will ensure Pirates qualify for the quarterfinal ahead of the return leg scheduled for Orlando Stadium on 11 April. The Soweto giants head Group A on four points following a 2-1 win over Nigerian side Enyimba at home on 17 March. Benghazi have proved that they are a tough nut to crack having beaten ES Setif 1-0 in their last match on 17 March. A win for Bhengazi will open the Group and add a lot of pressure on Pirates going into the return fixture. Bhengazi are tied with Enyimba on three points, but the Nigerian side have a better goal difference. Enyimba could mount pressure on Pirates if they overcome Algerian side Es Setif on the same day. Setif are bottom of the Group with one point from two matches. Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has showed that he is taking the Caf competition serious in a bid to emulate the side that lifted the Caf Champions League in 1995. The German mentor is spoilt for choice upfront with Tshegofatso Mabasa and Gabadinho Mhango back in contention for a place in attack. Mabasa has proven that he is also a prolific goalscorer having scored the winner against Enyimba. However, it remains to be seen whether Zinnbauer will continue to rely on wingers Deon Hotto and Vincent Pule for goals as they played a crucial role when all his strikers were still recovering in the casualty room.
