TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) midfielder Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo hopes for more game time after his impressive form helped VhadauVhadamani advance to the Nedbank Cup semi-final. Tshakhuma beat their Venda rivals Black Leopards 2-0 in the Ke Yona Cup quarter-final, with the 25-year-old scoring a goal and eventually being named Man of the Match. TTM’s other goal was scored by veteran defender Alfred Ndengane. “I am pleased with my performance and thanks to my teammates and technical team for their support,” said Ndlondlo. “It’s nice to get game time and I hope now I’ll play more. What makes me happier is that I scored and the team won. I’ve been working hard at training so that I should be ready when I get a chance to play. In football, you need to be disciplined and work hard all the time. I knew that as long as I am working hard, coach Dylan Kerr will give me a chance.” Kerr was delighted with Ndlondlo’s form and is predicting a bright future for the former AmaZulu player. “It was the first game for him (Ndlondlo) since I took over and he did not disappoint me,” said Kerr. “I have been watching him closely at training. He works hard all the time and his attitude is fantastic. He has not been playing and he never came to me and complain. “I am pleased with his form on Sunday and he deserved the Man of the Match award. “I keep telling all my players that when you get a chance, grab it and that is what Ndlondlo did on Sunday.” Added the former Baroka coach: “I rested some players who played against Golden Arrows before this clash against Leopards and now I have a big problem, especially in the midfielder of who to play in our next league game against AmaZulu (in Durban on Sunday). But it’s nice to have competition of committed players.” This is the second consecutive season Kerr has guided a team to the Nedbank Cup semi-final. Last season, the Englishman help Baroka qualify for Ke Yona Cup last four.
