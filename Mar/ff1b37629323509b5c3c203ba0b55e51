SWALLOWS have strengthened their attack with the signing of winger Bantu Mzwakali from Swedish club Brage on a short term deal. The former Chippa United star joined Brage at the beginning of last season. The move was confirmed by Mzwakali’s agent Raymond Pienaar who said:  “Bantu Mzwakali has joined Swallows until the end of the current season.” At Swallows, Mzwakali will be reunited with former teammate Ruzaigh Gamildien, who he played with at Ajax Cape Town (now Cape Town Spurs) when they won the MTN8 trophy in the 2015-16 season. If Mzwakali impresses in the remaining DStv Premiership matches, Swallows are set to retain him for next season as they are likely to lose powerful winger Kgaogelo Sekgota to Kaizer Chiefs at the end of the season. Sekgota joined Swallows last November but his contract ends at the conclusion of the season. Swallows coach Brandon Truter will hope Mzwakali’s speed on the flank will help his side that have struggled to win games recently. The Soweto club have not won any of their last seven league matches since beating Baroka FC in January. This has led to them dropping out off the title chase. The club lies fifth on the table with 31 points after 18 games.
