ACTRESS and TV presenter Lerato Mvelase has scored herself a new role. She has joined Mzansi Magic’s new drama series, The Station, where she will play Cynthia Motha. She told Daily Sun she was a bit sceptical when she was asked if she was available for the role. “I couldn’t say no once I saw the script and that I would be acting alongside the legendary Sello Maake-KaNcube. To say I was excited would be an understatement because I have always wanted to work with him,” she said. Lerato described her character as bitter and angry. “Cynthia is an extremely ambitious woman who has always wanted more for herself. That is why she dated and got married to an older man. That was her gateway to a better life,” she said. “But as she got older she realised that things are not what they seem and that makes her extremely bitter toward her husband because her marriage did not give her the lifestyle she had hoped for.” The former Isibaya actress told the People’s Paper her character will spark conversation around how women could also be abusive toward their partners. “This is because everything is so focused on women being abused and I agree that is the current reality in the country,” she said. “But there is another reality of men being abused by women and it is not spoken about because it is not easy for men to come out in the open. “I’m interested in how Mzansi will react to the storyline.” She said she was grateful it did not take time to land another role after Isibaya ended.
