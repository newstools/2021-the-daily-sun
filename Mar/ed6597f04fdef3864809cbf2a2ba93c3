SIYABONGA Ngezana has solemnly promised to repay Kaizer Chiefs for showing faith in him. On Friday, the club announced that the lanky defender penned a new three-year deal with the club. The new deal will see the playing staying with Amakhosi for another five years. “The feeling is great,” Ngezana told the Chiefs website after signing a new contract. “It always feels like I’m joining the club for the first time when I sign a new contract. I am looking forward to repaying the club by working hard and hopefully winning trophies.” He added: “I would really like to thank the chairman, Mr. Kaizer Motaung, and the management for the faith and trust they have shown in me. Ngezana concluded: “I’d also like to give thanks to my family for all the support. We will have a small celebration at home today. "But what I know is that real work starts now!” The 23-year-old player joined Amakhosi as a Youth Development Academy player at the age of 17. He spent two years in the junior structures before being promoted to the senior team, where he scored on his debut against Mamelodi Sundowns in October 2017. Chiefs revealed that Ngezana would be traveling with the team to Angola for the Group C game in the Champions League against Petro de Luanda, set to take place on Tuesday in Angola.
