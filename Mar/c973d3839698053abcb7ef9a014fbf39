   PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver a eulogy during King Zwelithiniâ€™s special memorial service prayer today. The service will be held at the KwaKhethomthandayo royal house in Nongoma, KZN, where many dignitaries, government officials and traditional leaders are expected to attend. King Zwelithini died on Friday after he lost his battle against diabetes and Covid-19-related complications. He had spent more than a month in hospital fighting for his life. Following his death, the president declared a Special Official Category One funeral, but later it was changed to a memorial prayer service because of the private burial protocols. The king was privately planted last night at KwaDlamahlahla royal palace by a few members of the royal family. Ramaphosa has always been close to the king, even wishing him a speedy recovery when he was delivering the State of the Nation Address last month. When he was elected as ANC president, he visited the king. He also visited him in 2018 when he introduced his ANC new top six and briefed him about the outcomes of the conference at Osuthu royal palace in Nongoma. He was accompanied by deputy president David Mabuza, national chairman Gwede Mantashe, Secretary General Ace Magashule and Treasurer Paul Mashatile. Zulu royal house spokesperson Prince Thulani Zulu confirmed that the president would deliver the eulogy at the memorial service prayer of the king.
