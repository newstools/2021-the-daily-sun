THE body of the Matsulu man who was attacked by a crocodile while fishing has been found this morning. Albert Singwane (55) disappeared on Wednesday while placing his fishing net in the river in Mpumalanga. He was found by his family members floating 100 metres from where he was attacked. His son, Nhlanhla Singwane, told Daily Sun they arrived at 5am to check and found his father floating with his left hand visible. “It is sad for the family but we thank God that his body has been found. His body is in a terrible state, however, we are glad that we will finally bury him,” he said. The family and community have been camping near the river since the day of the incident. CPF chairperson Jacob Siboza warned the fishing community to go in groups so that when they come across dangerous situations they can assist each other. “The community must take all precautionary measures when fishing. This river is becoming too dangerous, we need to ensure that we avoid similar incidents,” he said Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that the body was found, however, it is incomplete.
