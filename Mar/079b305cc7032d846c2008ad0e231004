NOT much has gone Gavin Hunt’s way since joining Kaizer Chiefs as head coach! It has been a roller-coaster ride for Amakhosi this season. However, on Saturday night they avoided equalling their longest run of nine matches of all competitions without a win. They defeated Angolan outfit Petro de Luanda 2-0 at FNB Stadium via goals from Eric Mathoho and Happy Mashiane, in what was their first-ever win in Caf Champions group stages. Hunt admitted they are going through a rough patch: “We are going through tough times, but we are sticking together. “It has not been easy, but it is what it is. I know the reasons why. “We’re going to stick together until the end. We all got to believe and show it.” The victory revived Amakhosi’s hopes of qualifying for the next round of the tournament. Chiefs are now third in Group C with four points, same as second-placed Horoya. They are both five points adrift of group leaders Wydad Athletic Club, who beat Horoya 2-0 at the weekend. Hunt has made his calculations and believes they can get enough points in the remaining matches to go through. “I always said if you look at the Champions League group stages, normally 10 or 12 points gets you in (into the next round). We are going to play away now twice and that is not going to be easy. We drew at home (with Horoya) in our first home game and that was a blow,” he said. Chiefs now turn their focus on the DStv Premiership as they’ll visit tricky Maritzburg United on Wednesday at Harry Gwala Stadium (6pm). Amakhosi are 10th in the domestic league with 19 points after 17 outings. Hunt admitted it would be challenging to transform their Champions League form into the league, but they will do their best. He stated: “We all know the PSL compared to the Champions League. It is a different game of football. PSL is much quicker and much harder in terms of running. We got a big game on Wednesday. We are missing a lot of games now. We are two or three behind now. We need to catch up.”
