SHE is a no-nonsense boss on Durban Gen but an embarrassing aunt on Uzalo. Actress Dudu Ngcobo’s character of Babekazi on Uzalo has been creating hilarious conversations on social media. Babekazi is not scared to speak her mind, no matter how it is received by others. She believes Gabisile (Baby Cele-Maloka) is evil and a murderer, which makes her proud to speak ill of her at her funeral. However, Dudu said she’s different to the character she plays. “Babekazi speaks the truth but she is embarrassing. She tells the truth as is and doesn’t care what other people think.

So when some viewers see me they call me that name and laugh, while others take me seriously. But I love how viewers react to the character,” said Dudu. The 54-year-old said when Stained Glass, the company that produces Uzalo, approached her for the character, she made research on it. She said every family has an aunt like Babekazi. “But when a character is different from you in real life, it’s always a challenge to portray it. But I’m glad I nail this one,” said Dudu. Her acting career started in 2017 when she acted on the drama Quantum of Terror on Mzansi Magic.
