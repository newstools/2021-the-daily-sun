NTUTHUKO Shoba remains in custody awaiting his next appearance on Thursday, 25 March. According to the NPA’s Phindi Mjonondwane, Shoba has appointed a new legal team and will be reapplying for bail based on new facts. Shoba is the alleged mastermind behind Tshegofatso Pule’s murder. He appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court on Thursday, 18 March. He’s facing charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and defeating the ends of justice. Shoba, a JSE analyst, was arrested for allegedly ordering a hit on his lover Pule when she was eight months pregnant, allegedly trying to hide the pregnancy from his wife. Shoba was arrested at his home after Muzikayise Malephane was bust in June last year. Malephane confessed in a plea agreement with the state that he had been hired to kill her. He said that he had been offered R70 000 by Shoba to get rid of Pule before his wife found out. Malephane was sentenced recently and is now serving a 20-year prison term. He is expected to testify against Shoba when the trial gets underway. Pule’s body was discovered by a passerby hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort. She was found after she had been missing for four days.
