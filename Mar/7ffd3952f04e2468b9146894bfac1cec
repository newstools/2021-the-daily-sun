HE allegedly raped two gogos and a minor in 2011 and helped cops look for the perpetrator. In the first incident in January of that year the North West man, who was 30 at the time, allegedly raped a 57-year-old woman. He offered to help the police track the perpetrator, whom he said he saw and knew. In July the man allegedly raped and assaulted an 85-year-old blind gogo three times. Again, he offered to help the gogo’s family and cops find the perpetrator. The Itsoseng Magistrates Court learnt yesterday the man described himself and what he wore to the cops and the gogo’s family. The officer handling the case noticed the man had semen on his trousers. He was arrested and DNA tests linked him to the first rape. The man also tried to rape a 16-year-old girl in March 2011 on her way to school. According to court documents, she escaped after he dragged and threw her into a ditch. However, while judgment was being passed down on Monday the man, who pleaded not guilty, bent his head, signalling he didn’t feel okay. The court had to be adjourned and he was taken to the local clinic where it was found his blood pressure had escalated. Magistrate Abigail Juris postponed the case to 29 July to allow the man to get treatment.
