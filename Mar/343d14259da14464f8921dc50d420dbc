THE Gauteng Department of Social Development has distanced itself from social a media message that is circulating about it distributing food parcels. The department said it had noted messages on social media about the distribution of food parcels in the province. Deputy director-general for social welfare services, Onkemetse Kabasia, said it was not distributing food. “This is not an official communication from the department, and it must be ignored,” he said He said from March last year, the department implemented a special food relief programme as part of the Covid-19 response when the country was in a hard lockdown. “At the end of September last year, the special food programme had distributed food relief to over 537 388 families, reaching over 2 686 940 people in the province.” He said the programme has since scaled down as it was a special project with a special budget allocation linked to the hard lockdown. Kabasia said the department now distributed food relief on a lower scale, targeting specifically profiled families or those who meet service requirements of the department but not the general public. “The social media posting is therefore incorrect and misleading. “The department has long scaled down on the massive Covid-19 food relief programme. “We encourage communities to follow the Department of Social Development’s media platforms to get the most accurate information,” he said.
