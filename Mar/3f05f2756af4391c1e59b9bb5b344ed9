FORMER Swallows FC and SuperSport United striker Phumelele “Ace” Bhengu believes he still has what it takes to play in the DStv Premiership. The 31-year-old is optimistic that he will return to the top flight next season. Bhengu is currently playing in for ABC Motsepe League outfit Lerumo after he failed to sign with any Premiership or GladAfrica Championship club this season. Last season the KwaZulu-Natal-born player helped Swallows return to the top flight with the likes of former Orlando Pirates midfielder Lebogang Mokoena and former Mamelodi Sundowns defender, Vuyo Mere. But Swallows coach Brandon Truter did not renew Bhengu’s contract. “I love football and I believe I still have many years in the game,” said Bhengu. “I am still in Joburg playing for a Motsepe League team from Daveyton called Lerumo. I signed a contract with them (Lerumo) until the end of the season. I am working hard as I still dream of playing in the top flight. “I know what it takes to play in the Premiership and how fit you have to be. I have to keep working hard and stay fit.” Asked about why his contract wasn’t renewed at Swallows, Bhengu said: “I have full respect for Swallows and their technical team. All I can say is that I have moved on with my life. I have been in the game (long enough) to understand how things are.” Bhengu has also played for the likes of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, Mpumalanga Black Aces, Chippa United, Thanda Royal Zulu, Real Kings and Royal Eagles. He has three caps for Bafana Bafana. The last time Bhengu played in the top flight was in 2016 when he was playing for Matsatsantsa a Pitori.
