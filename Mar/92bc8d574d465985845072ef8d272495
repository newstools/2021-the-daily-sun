Police have once again warned the public against buying fake vaccines. Since the beginning of the month, the police have been urging members of the public against buying vaccines for Covid-19. Police spokeswoman Colonel Brenda Muridili said: “No approved vaccines are currently available for sale online or physically. Any person who buys these drugs is putting themselves at risk and giving their money to organised criminals.” Muridili said this is a organised syndicate by people who want to enrich themselves by smuggling and distributing unregistered and illicit medicine. She said police are conducting investigations to detect and investigate anyone involved in the crime. In November, police raided a warehouse in Germiston, Ekurhuleni and four suspect were bust for being in contravention of Counterfeit Goods Act, the Customs and Excise Act as well as the Medicines and Related Substances Act. More than 2 400 doses of fake vaccines and fake masks worth R6 million were confiscated. Currently the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is rolled out to healthcare workers in the phase one of the vaccination programme. Anyone with knowledge of individuals and companies selling Covid-19 vaccines is urged to report to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or send tip-offs on MySAPS App.
