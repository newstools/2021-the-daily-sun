MAMELODI Sundowns winger Lyle Lakay cherishes every single moment he gets to spend time with his new born daughter. In fact, if the speedy winger had his way, he would have stayed behind when his side travelled to Lubumbashi in DR Congo where they beat TP Mazembe 2-1 in the Caf Champions League to spend more time with his baby. Lakay  was too excited when he boarded the flight to Mzansi that he posted a picture of his daughter opening her arms waiting for daddy to arrive home. “How you sleep knowing your daddy is coming home today.”  Another player who enjoys spending time with his children is Liverpool striker Mohamed Salah.Although Salah is always on the road with his team due to the hectic English Premier League schedule, he makes sure when he returns home that he brings joy to his daughters Makka and Cavan. The beloved two daughters where born in 2013 and 2020. Makka was born when Salah was playing for FC Basel in Switzerland and was named by Salah and his wife Maggi in honour of the Islamic holy city of Mecca. Salah enjoys making public appearances with Makka  and he enjoys showing his family on Instagram.
