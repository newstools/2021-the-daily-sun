WORKING from home left a man’s colleagues shocked when a naked woman appeared in the background of a virtual meeting. The colleague appeared to be very focused on what was on the screen and not in the background. Portfolio committee on human settlements, water and sanitation chairwoman Faith Muthambi, who was also part of the meeting, was shocked to witness the incident, saying this wasn’t the first encounter. Louisa Mbele commented: “I don’t know why I still get shocked when I see such things trending. “I’ve seen it all in Mzansi, and it’s not for the first time. It’s disgusting and needs to stop.” She suggested Parliament put measures in place to deal with such behaviour. Gugulethu Mkhonza said this made South Africa look like a nation of clowns, adding this would continue to happen. “We watch porn on our own and we don’t need to see such when we’re expecting to hear about important matters of our nation.” Bhushi Malaza said nothing would change, so long as officials didn’t get punishment for such behaviour. “The speaker mentioned that it’s not the first time this occurs. It’s happening again because it wasn’t dealt with the first time. “I just stopped watching that meeting immediately when I saw that naked lady. It’s really annoying.“ Zenzile Mdanyane said in Mzansi you got to see naked people like you were seeing trees around streets. She said it was too much to deal with, especially coming from parliamentary officials. “I really hope they come up with a way to deal with such behaviour. It’s unacceptable.”
