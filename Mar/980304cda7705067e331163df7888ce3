HEALTH worker Larry Molepo has lived in fear since the outbreak of coronavirus. The 30-year-old was a member of the medical team that nursed the first Covid-19 patient admitted to Mediclinic Morningside, Joburg. Larry, who lives with his late mother’s former employers, said he feared infecting the couple because they were elderly. He said his stress and anxiety has since gone down after receiving his vaccine jab early this month. Larry, originally from Limpopo, said after finishing matric he didn’t know what to do until he became a paramedic. While working in basic life support, he became interested in nursing. In 2013, he began pursuing it, eventually becoming a qualified nurse in 2018. “Nursing is my passion. Carrying my duties comes effortlessly because I love what I do,” said Larry. But things became challenging when the country was hit by the pandemic and Larry was placed in a Covid-19 ward. “We were waiting for Covid-19 patients. I was very scared but it was my job and I had to do it,” he said. “Walking around with personal protective equipment was also challenging. They are very hot, so you sweat a lot. “When I arrived home every day, I changed my clothes and put them in a plastic for washing. I then immediately took a shower.” He said he cared for the elderly couple he was staying with, and didn’t want to lose them to the virus. “It broke my heart whenever I heard of health workers being infected. Some people I had worked with at various hospitals succumbed to it. “The vaccination has put my mind at ease. I carry my duties feeling less scared,” he said. After getting the jab, he felt tired and sleepy. “But I don’t know if it was the side effects because I had been working under pressure for many days.”
