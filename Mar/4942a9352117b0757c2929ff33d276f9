DJ and actress Thulisile Phongolo is not pregnant – she is not even planning to fall pregnant. On Tuesday night, she set the record straight, sharing that pregnancy was the last thing on her mind. Taking to Twitter, she said people were always fascinated by her being pregnant. “I don’t know why there’s a huge fascination with me being pregnant, every day. ‘She’s pregnant’. Well, I’m here to put you at ease, don’t hold your breath guys! It’s not happening anytime soon. Hayibo, ngaze ngalingwa bo!” It is not clear where the rumours came from but clearly Thulisile was not impressed. One of her fans said it was impossible for her to fall pregnant as she was single.
