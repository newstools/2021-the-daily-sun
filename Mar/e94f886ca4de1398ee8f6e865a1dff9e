Dear MizzB MY boyfriend and I have been having amazing sex for the past three years. We want to spice up our sex life and were thinking of anal sex. I want to know if it won’t make my partner like men. Dear Sista People do explore different options when it comes to sex. Anal sex is a form of sex that needs proper, clear understanding of what it consists of. You and your partner should do research about it and inform yourselves properly before exploring it. It doesn’t in any way turn anyone into a person they’re not. Keep safe!
