Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki will hope star forward Percy Tau can keep up his record-breaking scoring run in Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they meet Sudan on Omdurman on Sunday. Bafana need a draw to qualify for the Nations Cup finals in Cameroon early next year, but will certainly be made to work by a tricky Sudanese outfit.The last time they faced a similar scenario was ahead of the 2019 finals when they went to neutral Tunisia to meet Libya in a winner-takes-all battle and Tau’s double strike on that day – exactly two years ago – secured a 2-1 win.Those goals are part of an impressive run for Tau in Nations Cup qualifiers – he has now scored eight times in 11 matches in the preliminaries for the continental showpiece event.In fact, it is fair to say it was his goals that qualified Bafana for the 2019 tournament in Egypt, and his goals again that are keeping them on course for Cameroon this time round.He started the trend in his very first qualification match when he netted the second goal in a famous 2-0 win for Bafana in Nigeria in 2017. He scored again against Seychelles in the last campaign, and then got those two crucial goals against Libya.He now has four goals in this qualification campaign as well – all of them coming in his last three caps – after netting three in the two home games against Sao Tome e Principe last November, and then on Thursday versus Ghana to secure a draw.His total of eight goals is the most ever netted by a South African in Nations Cup qualifiers, and is just three behind leading forward Benni McCarthy (11 goals) in all Nations Cup matches (qualifiers and finals).The next highest scorer in Nations Cup qualifiers is Tokelo Rantie with six – his last coming in that same game against Nigeria where Tau scored his first. -Supersport.com
