BAFANA Bafana have been on a slippery slope since their heydays of conquering Africa in 1996. A shock graphic has shown that Bafana have completely lost their way since South Africa were readmitted to Fifa in 1992. Bafana, once the top football country on the African continent after winning the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Mzansi, are no longer feared by other African nations. After Clive Barker’s boys claimed the country’s only major trophy in 1996, Bafana were ranked 19th in the world in 1997. From 1996 to 1998, nations would struggle to beat Bafana who were feared throughout the continent. This led to Bafana qualifying for the 1998 Fifa World Cup in France under Philippe Troussier. But since then, things have gone south. One of the possible reasons Bafana have failed to repeat their feat of 1996 is due to the continuos change of national coaches.  In the 1998 Afcon played in Burkina Faso, Bafana failed to defend their trophy losing to Egypt in the final. Bafana finished third in the next Afcon tournament, which was co-hosted in Ghana and Nigeria in 2000. Bafana slipped again in 2002 reaching the quarter-finals in 2002, the group stages in 2004, 2006 and 2008. The 2006 Afcon was a total embarrassment for Bafana in Egypt. Bafana, under the late Ted Dumitru, could not score a goal or win a point in the group stages. Despite hosting the 2010 Fifa World Cup, Bafana made unwanted history by becoming the first host to fail to qualify for the knockout rounds. And to add more misery, Bafana did not qualify for that year’s Afcon in Angola. Bafana also failed to qualify for the 2012 Afcon played in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The following year, Bafana qualified for the 2013 edition. This was when Mzansi was awarded hosting rights after Libya pulled out at the last minute due to the civil war in that country. Towards the end of 2001, Bafana were ranked 40th in the world and in 2004, they were on 38th. They then went into a steady decline ending 49th, 67th, 77th, 76th and 85th. It was only in 2010 when Bafana were ranked 51st and 52nd in 2011. But since then, it has been another sad decline in the rankings 87th, 62nd, 52nd, 72nd, 60th, 81st 72nd, 71st and 71st. Currently, Bafana are still 71st in the Fifa world rankings. Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki, who named his squad a few weeks ago to face Ghana and Sudan for the two remaining crunch Afcon qualifiers next week, admitted that modern football has dynamically changed. “In doing analysis, you are no longer doing analysis of individual players. You also look at the coach, his tactical approach, his structure and how he uses individual players in the team,” he said. Now pressure is mounting on Ntseki following Patrice Motsepe’s ascendancy to the highest office of the Confederation of African Football (Caf), as president. Motsepe, along with Safa president Danny Jordaan, said they want Mzansi national teams to excel and not disappoint the Caf president and the federation.
