REGGAE gospel star Samuel Suh has released a new single, One Word. This is an upward trajectory for the talented singer, who gained prominence when he released his EP The Lion Boy Vol 1 back in 2014. Speaking to SunBuzz, Samuel said: “Although I’m a hip hop lover, gospel music has always played a major role in my life and after recording and listening to my first ever gospel song Rivers, I knew this was my calling and the sole purpose of my music. “One Word is amazing and it will take listeners to a tropical haven of calm and balance. It also carries a message of hope that’ll remind them that no matter how many curveballs life throws at them, God’s word remains.” ALSO READ: THE CAUSE OF NOXEE'S DEATH REVEALED The Cameroon-born singer said he hopes his song will bring about change and healing to Africans. “With this song I know that I’m being used as a vessel to spread the message of light and truth. “I’d like to see African people emerging from sorrow and pain and into a place of grace and spiritual freedom,” he said. “If we all showed kindness to each other, no one in Africa would struggle. “I believe in finding reassurance in the word, even in my darkest days I lift myself up with the reminder of the word being whole and finding peace in the word is all there is.” Samuel, who’s formerly known as 1 Zeal, told SunBuzz he hopes to release an album later this year. “I’m in no rush. I’m planning to release a lot of singles to reintroduce myself and my sound and make sure people are comfortable with the new me,” he said. His single is available on all digital platforms.
