 THE Queen actress Zandile Msutwana has been forced to take a
break from the show following an injury on set. According to a statement from Mzansi Magic, Zandile, who
plays the role of Vuyiswa Maake, sustained an undisclosed injury while on set
and unfortunately cannot carry out her duties. She has now been booked off to recover well at home. On the show, Vuyiswa is pretty much the boss of her own
life. She is smart, driven and an intelligent policewoman – a straight talker
who will not let anyone walk all over her. She becomes Jerry’s confidant and
journeys with him through reconciling with his son. The producers of the show have decided to find someone to
play the role of Vuyiswa in Zandile’s absence. ALSO READ: PICS: IS BABES WODUMO PREGNANT? Award-winning TV host and actress Thembisa Mdoda-Nxumalo has

for taking this gigantic challenge with so much grace. We wish Msutwana a
speedy recovery and look forward to her return soonest,” read the statement.
