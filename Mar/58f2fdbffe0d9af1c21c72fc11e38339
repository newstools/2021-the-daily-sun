A Johannesburg police officer was shot dead in Alexandra on Tuesday night. "It is reported that [Sergeant Moshela Mokgoba] and colleagues were following a suspicious vehicle and on 3rd Street near, Pan African Mall, there was a traffic jam so he and a colleague proceeded to approach the said vehicle on foot. But shots were fired from that vehicle," said police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili. Mokgoba was declared dead on the scene. "The province has already instituted the 72-hour activation plan and mobilised all the...resources needed to investigate this incident," Muridili added. The suspect, who is known to the police, is being tracked. National police commissioner Khehla Sitole sent his condolences to Mokgoba's family, she said. "[He] has been assured by the province that they are affording the family of the deceased member all the support they need during this time of bereavement. The members at the station are also being afforded counselling," Muridili said. SOURCE: NEWS24
