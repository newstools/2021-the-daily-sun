PARLIAMENT is to launch an investigation into allegations against Eskom senior managers, including CEO Andre de Ruyter. One of the allegations is that the power utility has been overlooking black-owned suppliers in favour of companies owned by whites. Representatives from Eskom were due to appear before the standing committee on public accounts yesterday to answer questions about deviations and expansions in the 2020/2021 financial year, the annual report for 2019/2020 and investigations by the Special Investigating Unit. But the hearing could not proceed because chief procurement officer Solly Tshitangano was suspended by De Ruyter for poor performance. It emerged that Tshitangano had lodged a grievance with the power utility over the conduct of De Ruyter and other managers in chain supply. R40K BET ENDS IN TEARS! Tshitangano first sent a letter dealing with the matter to board chairman Malegapuru Makgoba in February last year and copied in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office. He sent a letter with these allegations to the committee on 2 March. Makgoba acknowledged the complaint, but told the committee he felt it should be dealt with by the Eskom executive. “The reason for this letter arose when the chief executive officer confronted Mr Tshitangano about his performance. These complaints did not arise spontaneously out of somebody wanting to complain about the CEO,” argued Makgoba. Committee chairman, IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa, said the allegations in the letter were very serious and needed to be probed. Hlengwa said the allegations presented a dilemma as De Ruyter would be answering questions in regard to expansions and deviations with a cloud over his head.
