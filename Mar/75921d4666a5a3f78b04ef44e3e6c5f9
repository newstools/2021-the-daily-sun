I’m sad and disappointed at our police and at the state. Defenseless kids, while trying to get and education, are being shot and killed.  Is this what we voted for? Government officials, accompanied by bodyguards that cost millions of rands, drive around in big Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs. Why can’t the money used on luxury blue-light convoys and fat salaries be given to varsity students?
