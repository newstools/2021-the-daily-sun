CAPE Town All Stars will be looking at maintaining their impressive run when they square off with Pretoria Callies in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal match at Danie Craven Stadium on Sunday (3pm). All Stars are heading into this encounter, flying high as they are undefeated in their last six competitive matches, where they recorded one draw and five victories. Igugu Lekapa reached the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals for the first time in the club's history. They defeated fellow GladAfrica Championship side Cape Town Spurs 5-3 on penalties in the last-16. All Stars coach Calvin Marlin says they are looking to reach the Nedbank Cup final and PSL promotional / relegation playoffs this season. "We are looking to keep improving on our log position, not looking too far ahead," Marlin quoted byÂ SuperSport.com. "Hopefully by the end, we have achieved something; if it means we get to the playoffs, making it to the final of the cup or getting more players to PSL level." Callies are also making their debut appearance in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals. They defeated Pretoria rivals JDR Stars 5-4 on penalties after a 0-0 draw last month. Their coach Sammy Troughton said they are targeting a victory, nothing less. "We want to keep the fans happy, the management happy and the players. So we are taking it very seriously. The players have been up for it at training, and we know it is not going to be an easy one," Troughton said on Thursday. "But I'm happy that the venue is Danie Craven, which is a bit of a neutral place. I don't think they have played there. We are going to Cape Town to try and get the result."
