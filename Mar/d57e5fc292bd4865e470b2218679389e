NETBALLER Nobuhle Sibisi’s dream of representing the South African national team is slowly becoming a reality. The 20-year-old is among 15 players called up by coach Elsje Jordaan for a Spar Challenge scheduled between 24-31 March. The players will assemble for camp on 18 March. Sibisi is one of the players who impressed at the 2020 Spar National Championships held in Bela-Bela. In January, Netball South Africa suspended all planned activities with immediate effect due to a resurgence in Covid-19 cases in the country. “Firstly, to be back in the court preparing with teammates knowing you will play is one thing we happy for,” she said. “It was demotivating to train alone at home, knowing you won’t be playing anytime soon. Now I am happy that things are slowly getting back to normal. "We were so excited when the coaches told us we can now train.On her national team call up which is her first at the under-21 stage, Sibisi said she is overwhelmed. She said: “I feel privileged to be part of the squad. It is my first national team call-up, and I would also like to thank the coaches." Sibisi is now aiming to be a regular in the team and do well to be among the players representing South Africa at this year’s Netball World Youth Cup taking place in Fiji in December. “From a young age, I have always seen the national netball team and always wanted to be in the team. I am very honored. However, the journey does not stop here. I will work hard for the team as I’m hoping to form part of the World Cup squad.”
