THE search for two missing boys was postponed until Wednesday, 10 March because of high water levels. Siphiwe Mlangeni (14) and Moratehi Radebe (14) from LT Nhlabathi Intermediate School went missing at about 10am on Thursday, 4 March. Police investigations revealed the boys drowned in the Liebenbergvlei River near Bohlokong kasi in Bethlehem. Speaking to Daily Sun, their parents said they’d lost hope. Thomas Mkhwanazi said: “We’re getting mixed messages from police and public. “Some say our kids drowned while others say they’re alive. We don’t know who to believe. If they’re dead we need to see the bodies.” Brigadier Motansi Makhele said arrangements were made to closed the gates and reduce the water level so the search could continue. The boys and another schoolboy of the same age were walking towards the river, but the missing boys were last seen taking another route. Police divers resumed the search on Friday, 5 March. But the search had to be called off due to the high water level and heavy current. Arrangements are being made to close the valves.
