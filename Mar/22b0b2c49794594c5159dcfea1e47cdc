THE Zulu royal family has officially
announced that the third wife of King Goodwill Zwelithini, queen Mantfombi
Dlamini Zulu, will act as regent of the Zulu monarch. This is after Isilo sikhotheme two weeks
ago. This was announced by the Zulu monarch
prime minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, following a meeting between the
Zulu royal family and the late king’s lawyers. Addressing the media after the meeting,
Buthelezi said the king’s will was read by his lawyers. “In line with the wishes of his majesty,
the family would like to announce that her majesty queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu
will act as the regent of the Zulu nation during the interregnum. While her
majesty is acting as the regent, further decisions about the successor will not
be announced until the three-month mourning period for the family is over,” he
said. Buthelezi added that the nation will be
free to plough from Friday, 26 March as the king’s wishes. It was rumoured that the third wife of
the king will be the interim leader of the Zulu nation. Queen Mantfombi is the mother of prince
MisuZulu (48), who many claim will take the throne. Sources said the queen would act until
her first son prince MisuZulu is married. “Prince MisuZulu is old enough to lead
but he can’t lead the nation because he is not married. Once he’s married,
automatically they will give him the throne,” said a source. Queen Mantfombi is the daughter of the
late king Mswati II and she’s the current Swatini king’s sister. Sources said Mantfombi was appointed
because among  king Zwelithini’s wives,
she was the only of royal blood and the king’s successor would come from her. “She has eight princes but as per the
Zulu culture, the first son who is MisuZulu will be the next king. That’s why
king Zwelithini appointed her to be regent while she is preparing her son for
the throne,” the source said.
