THE ex-boyfriend of Khanyi Mbau, Tebogo Lerole, has conceded defeat and said he just wants to move on with his life. Last year, Khanyi announced that after being with Tebogo for 10 years, they had both decided to part ways. This was before she snatched herself a Zimbabwean businessman whom she’s currently dating. Now Tebogo has come out and said he couldn’t be happier for his ex-girlfriend, saying he wishes her nothing but the best. In a long-winded Instagram post, the Kwela Tebza band member said: “If you genuinely know me, you know I hate being dragged in the media, especially for impractical rationale (she knows it too). I’m not a personality and unquestionably not a celebrity either. I’m a black man raising a daughter/nephew is this exacting world.

He said he believed that with Khanyi he had a family that would be by his side, even when the world ends. “Up above is a clip I believe would be my own/our own perfect family and for once I believed our world would end with us standing by each other’s side. I love M and M2 profoundly, just thinking of our moments and times leaves me giggling. “I don’t know how I lost the both of them, however, I cherish both of them and will always cherish them and the day the Creator tangled our paths. She is an amazing human and has such an adorable smile – she must constantly glitter. I’m grown enough to accept defeat. Full stop,” he said. Tebogo said he wished his former bae nothing but success in her future and asked the media to “please cut her and myself some slack. Love is beautiful and we tried”. A post shared by @edwardbillion
