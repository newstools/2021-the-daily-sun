SUPERSPORT United came from behind to earn a point in the dying minutes when they held Stellenbosch FC to a 1-1 draw in the DStv Premiership match at the Danie Craven Stadium on Friday evening. The crucial draw saw them leapfrog Orlando Pirates to the thir spot in the log standings. Golden Arrows who are second on the log, SuperSport and Orlando Pirates all have 35 points each team. They are separated by goal difference. Stanley Dimgba was the first player to find the back of the net putting Stellies in the lead after 59 minutes of the match, after the two sides went to the half-time break tied on 0-0. After Digmba's goal, SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo introduced Kudakwashe Mahashe who gave them a different eb=negy as they were searching for an equaliser. Mahachi proved to be an inspired substitute with eight minutes left as he fired home from close range to make it 1-1 with Rusike grabbing the assist. The late goal ensured that the encounter ended in a 1-1 draw with Stellenbosch and SuperSport sharing the spoils on the night. The draw saw Stellies remain ninth on the league standings - three points behind eighth-placed Cape Town City. SuperSport controlled the match from the first whistle and they were able to create goalscoring opportunities which they could not convert. An unmarked Jamie Webber received a cross from the right and he unleashed a tame shot which was easily gathered by Sage Stephens in the Stellies goal-posts in the 18th minute. The ball then fell kindly for Sipho Mbule in the box four minutes later and the new Bafana Bafana international's deflected shot was parried away by Stephens. SuperSport who came to this match with fresh legs as they had two weeks break will have another two weeks break as their next match will only be on 10 April where they will visit Cape Town City.
