THE alleged mastermind behind the killing of Tshegofatso Pule, Ntuthuko Shoba, has been denied bail by the Roodepoort Magistrates Court. Shoba is facing charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and defeating the ends of justice. He was arrested for allegedly ordering a hit on Pule when she was eight months pregnant to hide the pregnancy from his wife. Shoba was arrested after Muzikayise Malephane, the convicted killer, confessed in a plea agreement that he had been hired to kill the heavily-pregnant woman. He said he was offered R70 000 by Shoba to kill Pule before his wife found out about her pregnancy. Malephane was recently sentenced to 20 years behind bars. He confessed to pretending to be from an e-hailing service and fetching Pule from Shobaâ€™s house in Florida last year.
