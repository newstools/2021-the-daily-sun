A MANAGER at ArcelorMittal Steel in Vanderbijlpark, south of Joburg, was gunned down on Wednesday, 17 March. Peet Snyders (47), who was head of ArcelorMittal’s coke operations, was on his way home when he was killed by unknown suspects wearing balaclavas. ArcelorMittal CEO, Kobus Verster, sent a message of condolences to Snyders’ family. “The company is offering support to his family, including counselling services, during this difficult time,” he said. Verster said circumstances around the shooting were unknown. “The company will cooperate fully with the investigation to help the authorities get to the bottom of this crime so that the perpetrators are brought to book,” he said.  Police spokeswoman, Brigadier Mathapelo Peters, said a manhunt was launched to find the suspects behind the shooting. “It emerged during the preliminary investigation that the deceased was driving on the corner of Delfos and Hertz Boulevard when about four male suspects, all armed with firearms, wearing white balaclavas, alighted from a green vehicle with unknown registration numbers and fired multiple shots at the deceased’s vehicle, killing him instantly,” she said. Peters said the motive for the killing is yet to be determined. “Anyone who may have witnessed the incident or have information that could lead to the apprehension of the suspects is urged to contact their nearest police station or call Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” she said.
