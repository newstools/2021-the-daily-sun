SOUTH Africa has two provinces whose hatred towards the police is much-documented: Western Cape and KZN. These were the words of Police Minister Bheki Cele during his visit to Kraaifontein in Cape Town yesterday. His visit followed the deaths of two cops, Sergeant Mnakwazo Mdoko and Constable Mninawa Breakfast. The officers were killed while on duty on Saturday, by a group of suspects. Their firearms were stolen. Cele visited their families as well as the Kraaifontein policing area. He said six cops have been killed in almost 12 days.  “Two died in the Western Cape and four in KZN. I don’t understand the hate these provinces have. I don’t know what wrong police have done.” Cele said police will leave no stone unturned in making sure the people who did this faced the law. He assured the families they’d help them with anything they needed while they mourned their loved ones. Sphamandla Mdoko said his uncle was a hard-working cop. “This is a huge loss for us. He was everything to us, a pillar strength,” he said. Hawks head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya said a suspect (32) was bust in Mandela Park, Khayelitsha, in connection with the murders. He’ll appear in the Blue Downs Magistrates Court soon. Investigations continue.
