HEROES are known to wear capes, but some wear scrubs and masks. Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit our shores almost a year ago, healthcare workers have been in the trenches fighting to save lives. Yesterday, the Dare to Love Movement visited Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Joburg to show their appreciation for staff. Co-founder Daryl Hardy told Daily Sun: “The reason we went there is that it’s the busiest hospital and staff morale is down. “The public relations officer contacted us to come and encourage them. “We basically went there to encourage them and tell them they’re true heroes because they’re serving the community on the frontline. CHIKEN KILLS OWNER! “We gave them chocolates and biscuits to say thank you. “The reason for this is just to honour them because they’re true heroes risking their lives.” Daryl said they went to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital on Valentine’s Day to give staff love and treats. Charlotte Maxeke spokeswoman, Lungiswa Mvumvu, said staff were happy after the visit. She said the movement arrived at about 4am to catch those finishing their night shift and those arriving for the day shift. The gesture was welcomed and appreciated by hospital staff.
