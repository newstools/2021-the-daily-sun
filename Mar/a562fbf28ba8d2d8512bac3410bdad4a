THE funeral service of Mapula Khune is expected to be held at her parents’ home in Tshing kasi, Ventersdorp, on Thursday, 11 March. The 27-year-old was Kaizer Chiefs’ goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune’s sister. Her body was found badly burnt last week. A 17-year-old boy, who was arrested in connection with her alleged murder, was set free on Monday, 8 March due to a lack of evidence. BABY MAMA: I WARNED HIM! Mapula’s mum, Florah, said her daughter had a vision of cops and ambulances surrounding her parents’ house before she was burnt to ashes. She recalled that on that day of the incident, Mapula was supposed to be helping a boy who needed assistance with his homework. But she later died in the fire. Police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh told Daily Sun that the case against the teenage boy was not enrolled pending further investigation. NPA spokesman Henry Mamothame said following a thorough study of the docket and consultation with the police, the NPA resolved that the docket be returned to the police for further investigations.
