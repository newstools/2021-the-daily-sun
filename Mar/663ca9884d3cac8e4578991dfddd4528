Freedom
fighter and former Robben Island political prisoner Cecyl Esau has died. He died of
natural causes at his home in Table View, Cape Town, at the age of 66. Esau is an
Umkhonto we Sizwe veteran who was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment on Robben
Island and was released in 1991. He studied
at the University of the Western Cape during the 1970s and 1980s. Today, one of
the university's residences is named after him. "The
ANC in the Western Cape is saddened by the sudden passing of comrade Cecyl
Esau," the organisation said in a statement. "A
former University of the Western Cape student, the Worcester-born comrade Cecyl
walked a committed road in the freedom struggle. This road took him to the
United Democratic Front, armed struggle as an Umkhonto we Sizwe member, and
Robben Island as a political prisoner." Esau was
awarded the Freedom of Worcester in 2020, for his contribution to the rights to
freedom and justice. In a social
media post, the Esau family confirmed his death. He is
survived by five children, a granddaughter, his sister June Esau and two
brothers Alexander and Jacob Esau. "We
mourn with our comrade's family and will always remember and treasure the
memory of his fighting spirit and willingness to sacrifice for his commitment
to freedom," the ANC said. SOURCE:
