THE Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) has expressed its shock at the death of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Contralesa president Kgoshi Mathibela Mokoena conveyed heartfelt condolences on the passing of the king on behalf of Contralesa. “On behalf of Contralesa we are sending our heartfelt condolences to the Royal Zulu Kingdom. It came as a shock to us, because we were expecting him to recover. Unfortunately, it was not to be. What makes us even more sad is that he passed on after he requested for government to finalise the issue of land, that it should be transferred to royalties and their people. Unfortunately, he passed on before it could happen,” he said. "To the Zulu nation and all traditional leaders in KZN, we are sending condolences. You are not alone in this,” said Kgoshi Mokoena. He said it was a known fact that His Majesty was championing development in his area. "Among other things he invited Patrice Motsepe, his Motsepe Foundation and African Rainbow Minerals to have infrastructure in his area, and it really happened. In KZN there are some schools that he built, and many boreholes that were dug because of him. “All this happened because of his revolutionary ideas. It is a pity that he passed on while some of us were still looking forward to him assisting us with his ideas as a great leader, " he said. ANC NEC member Violet Siwela also sent her condolences to the Zulu Kingdom. "As a member of the ANC NEC, we are saddened by the passing of our great Zulu king. It's a great loss to us as a nation. We have lost a visionary, great fearless leader who was always upfront on issues of development. May God receive his soul," said Siwela.
