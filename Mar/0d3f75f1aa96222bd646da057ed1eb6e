TALENTED actresses Nokuthula Mavuso and Swankie Mafoko agree on isithembu. Nokuthula started the debate on her Twitter account, drawing from her own experiences. She said isithembu expands family ties and keeps the family legacy alive. She said polygamy is a wonderful practice, as long as it’s done right. “Isithembu, when done right, can be a blessing. Parents, grandparents and siblings can pass on and the other houses remain. Awufi umuzi,” she tweeted. “My paternal granddad had three wives. Two were izangoma, the other umthandazi. He was an inyanga. You can imagine how lit the g-unit is.” Nokuthula went on to explain that her parents, their siblings and her grandparents were no longer alive. But because of isithembu, she still had a stable family. “Umkhulu nogogo, my mum and her siblings are all gone. But we still have a gran, uncles, aunties and cousins from the other houses. We can just call them up whenever,” she said.

You get to work, a random Simon sexually harasses you. Your big break becomes a nightmare.”
