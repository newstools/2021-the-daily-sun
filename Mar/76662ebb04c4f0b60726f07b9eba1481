THE Gauteng Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation unit
arrested six suspects on Friday, 19 March for kidnapping and extortion. Among the six arrested in Joburg, there were two police
officers ranked as a sergeant and a constable. The suspects are aged between 32
and 48 years old and are expected to appear in court on Tuesday, 23 March. According to Hawks spokeswoman Colonel Katlego Mogale,
information was received of a person who was allegedly kidnapped by people who
claimed that they worked for the Hawks and were looking for the victim in a
money laundering case. “The suspects are alleged to have demanded R2 million in
order to release the victim.  The information was operationalised wherein
the real members of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation attached
to Serious Corruption Investigation in Gauteng pounced on the suspects,” Mogale
said. Mogale said further investigation led to the victim being
able to positively identify his alleged kidnappers. “Among the identified suspects was a sergeant, a constable
as well as one suspect who was sought for another corruption case,” she said. The national head for the Directorate for Priority Crime
Investigation, Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya, praised the members for a
sterling job. Lebeya also warned those who are intent on tarnishing the image
of the directorate to beware that the directorate will respond decisively.
