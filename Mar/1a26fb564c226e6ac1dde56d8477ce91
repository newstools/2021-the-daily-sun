THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) has disbanded this yearâ€™s DStv Diski Challenge to launch a new competition that will kick off next month. SunSport has seen a document which was sent to all clubs and signed by PSL acting CEO Mato Madlala last Friday. This comes after the DStv Diski Challenge (reserve league) was suspended on 6 January this year due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The PSL executive committee (Exco) has resolved to nullify the 2020-21 Diski Challenge competition. In the statement, the league says an agreement has been reached between the PSL and the sponsor to replace the 2020-21 DStv Diski Challenge competition with a new competition. The competition will commence on the weekend of 3 April and its format will comprise two streams of eight teams each. In Stream One are AmaZulu, Cape Town City, Chippa United, Golden Arrows, Maritzburg United, Stellenbosch, Supersport United and TS Galaxy. In Stream Two are Baroka, Black Leopards, Bloemfontein Celtic, Kaizer Chiefs, Mamelodi Sundowns, Orlando Pirates, Swallows and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila.
