BLACK Leopards assistant coach Lehlohonolo Seema is appealing to Lidoda Duvha fans not to press the panic button. Seema, who is in charge of Lidoda Duvha as their Serbian coach Kosta Papic is still waiting for his work permit, was speaking after Leopards 3-1 DStv Premiership loss against TS Galaxy at Mbombela Stadium on Wednesday. Struggling Leopards are bottom on the log after collecting only 12 points from 19 games. This season, the Venda-based side have only won three league games, drawn three and lost 13. Leopards have also been poor defensively and have conceded 34 goals. And to make matter worse for Leopards, they are set to face high-flying and log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns in their next league encounter at Loftus Versfeld on 21 March. But before the Downs clash, Leopards host their Venda rivals Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday (6pm). “This is an interesting game for the Venda people as it is a derby,” said the 40-year-old former Bloemfontein Celtic and Chippa United coach. “This game is not about advancing to the semifinals, but also winning bragging rights against our rivals. A win will also be a huge boost for us going into Sundowns game.” Added Seema: “We are working hard with coach Papic on the team and I’m sure we will start getting results and move from the bottom. “I have full confidence that we will not get relegated. “There is no need to panic as coach Papic will help us survive. Those who think we will go down will eat humble pie, come the end of the season. “It has not been easy but we will get it right.”
