COULD Josef Zinnbauer be playing mind games? With SuperSport United stuttering in their quest to dethrone
Mamelodi Sundowns at the summit of the PSL table, Orlando Pirates emerge as
favourites to challenge Manqoba Mngqithi’s rampant Brazilians. Pirates are third in the log standings with 32 points after
19 games - four behind Sundowns who head the standings with 36 points, plus two
games in hand. However, Zinnbauer says they are nowhere from challenging
the 10 time PSL champions. Talking after their hard-fought 1-0 victory over
Bloemfontein Celtic on Tuesday, the German coach said: “We can’t talk about the
title, it is not possible at the moment.” “We don’t have enough points,” he added. “We look from game to game. We have also the cup in the bag.
We have to see what happens in the future. When we come closer, we can talk
about the title." On Saturday Pirates will be looking at pilling more pressure
on Sundowns by closing the chasm to a single point, as they travel to the
Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium to face Chippa United. Sundowns are currently busy with their Caf Champions League
schedule where they have TP Mazembe on Saturday. They will resume with their DStv Premiership schedule on 21
March when they host relegation-haunted Black Leopards. Zinnbauer admitted they did not play well against Celtic who
played the second half with 10 players after Ndumiso Mabena was sent off just
before halftime following a rough tackle on Linda Mntambo. "Difficult game. Not the best performance from us. But
recently we had a lot of games and here we didn't play so well but we have
three points. He added: “Sometimes it's more work against 10 players. Not
a good performance from us but we are happy with three points. It was important
for us.”
