PASTOR Timothy Omotoso appeared in the Port Elizabrth High Court in Gqeberha on Monday, 1 March. He appeared together with his two co-accused Lusanda Solani and Zukiswa Sitho. The trio faces charges of rape, sexual assault and racketeering. Defence advocate Peter Dauberman cross-examined state witness Wendy Mahola about her relationship with Omotoso. Wendy is one of 47 witnesses lined up by the state against Omotoso. Dauberman told Wendy: “You are contradicting yourself sometimes, you changed the evidence.” However, she stuck to her statement. “I didn’t have a sexual relationship with him, I refused. I was called to his place in Summerstrand by accused number three. Omotoso told me that he wants to have a close deep relationship with me. “That is when I realised he wanted to have sex with me and I told him I only want to have father and daughter relationship. He said this one has a boyfriend and is going to give us problems,” she said.
