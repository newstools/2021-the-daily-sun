IZINDUNA have saluted late Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, calling him a father and true leader. Gauteng izinduna chairman Siphiwe Mhlongo said: “He led us well. We’re not complaining. He was the longest-serving leader of our nation.” He said the king always stayed true to his identity. “He fought for our culture not to be forgotten. He always stood for what was right,” he said. “He always preached ubuntu and didn’t like fights. He always intervened to stop them.” Mhlongo told Daily Sun everything Ungangezwelakhe planted in their hearts would remain there forever. “He brought our culture back into the spotlight. Ceremonies like Umkhosi Womhlanga were no longer there but he brought them back. He taught us respect, and that men should respect women.” Mhlongo said losing the king was a huge blow for the Zulu nation and country as a whole. “Not so long ago we were bidding farewell to our prince, his son. Before that wound could even heal, we’re now bidding farewell to Ubhejane ephuma esiqiwini himself. We feel like we’ve wronged God. Why is He punishing us like this?” Izinduna said they were in deep mourning. Kwa Mai Mai induna Nkosinathi Ndwandwe told the SunTeam: “The whole nation is in mourning. We will mourn until after the king has been planted.” He said they were pleading with the nation to suspend all events, especially celebration ceremonies. “Let’s avoid arguments that could lead to conflict. Let’s be in a mourning mood. Let’s respect Isilo and show him we heard his teachings,” he said. Mhlongo said they’d follow lockdown restrictions, which don’t allow large gatherings. “If there were no Covid-19 restrictions we’d have been on our way to the palace.” Izinduna wished the royal family and prime minister of the Zulu nation, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, strength during this difficult time.
