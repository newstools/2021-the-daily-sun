People, especially children and young people, must inform their families of their whereabouts. A child goes missing every five hours in South Africa, and that’s concerning and worrying. In South Africa, when kids and young people go missing, they’re often found dead and buried in shallow graves or dumped in bins or flowing rivers. People should be careful at all times. While social media is extremely useful in tracing missing people, we also have to be careful. We must teach our kids not to accept gifts and lifts from strangers. We need to strive to create a safe environment for all in Mzansi.
