KAIZER Chiefs face a mammoth task in a bid to end their six-year trophy drought by lifting the Caf Champions League. Amakhosi host Group C leaders Wydad Casablanca at FNB Stadium on Saturday (6pm). The Soweto giants are aiming to avenge a humiliating 4-0 defeat they suffered to the Moroccan side in the first leg played in Burkina Faso in February. They managed to dust themselves to draw with Angolan side Petro de Luanda and beat them 1-0 in January prior to another goalless draw with Horoya. Chiefs are tied on five with second placed Horoya AC from four matches, however the Guinean outfit have a better goal difference. Angolan side Petro de Luanda are rooted to the bottom of mini league table on one point. Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt is aware of the importance of winning the match as it will put them in good position to go through to the quarterfinal of competition. This will also ease pressure on them prior to their last group match against Horoya. But Amakhosi won’t have an easy passage top glory considering that Wydad are unbeaten in 11 matches, having registered nine victories and two draws in all competition. This means Hunt will need to come up with a plan that will unlock the solid Wydad defence that has yet to concede a goal in the Group stages while scoring seven goals in the process to head standings with 10 points. Amakhosi are highly motivated as they are also unbeaten in five games in all competitions. This will be the second time Chiefs will host Moroccan opponents having previously lost 1-0 to Raja Casablanca in the 2015 in the first round of competition. Overall, Chiefs will be hosting North African opponents in the CAF Champions League for a fourth time having defeated Egyptian giants Zamalek 2-1 in the second round first leg in 1993. Amakhosi also won 2-1 against Tunisian side Esperance in a 2005 CAF Champions League second round’s second leg encounter.
