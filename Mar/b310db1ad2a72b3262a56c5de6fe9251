IT appears the trial of the father accused of killing his four kids still has a long way to go. Lucas Phasha’s trial resumed in the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane yesterday. But Judge Gerrit Muller postponed it to 26 April to allow the submission of arguments between the state and his lawyer for judgment on Thursday, 25 March.  His nephew Raymond and his wife Sylvia Monyela will then continue with their testimonies on 26 March. His lawyer Advocate Lawrence Mkhize challenged the admission of the Facebook posts, posted on the day of the killings. He said although the names were of his client, the account could have been hacked. Raymond, who fetched Lucas from his hideout after the bodies were discovered, said his uncle told him he would not let the man having an affair with his wife take them as she was not a caring mother. He said he was shocked to learn that his uncle posted his marital issues on Facebook the day before his kids were found. “Most of the things he told me about his wife were written on his Facebook wall. “He said his wife had cheated on him, tested positive for HIV and was spreading it around Ga-Phasha,” said Raymond.
