HERE is some real food for thought: When I was younger, I was often told to never play with my food. This was a fundamental lesson that I carried into adulthood…until fashion came along. Then one day, I saw a certain Lady going Gaga and wearing meat to a prestigious event. Now there is a new fashion trend sprouting out of control called “mushroom leather”. Think what I’m serving you is a mouthful? Well, British fashion designer Stella McCartney has debuted two garments made from mushroom fabric and will continue to use the natural material in her upcoming collections. According to The South African magazine, the 49-year-old designer has teamed up with Bolt Threads to use Mylo, a leathery fabric made from the root system of fungi, for black bustier tops and utilitarian trousers. McCartney, whose eponymous label avoids using leather, feathers, and fur, had this to say in an interview: “I believe the Stella community should never have to compromise luxury desirability for sustainability, and Mylo allows us to make that a reality. ”McCartney previously used Mylo for a prototype of the brand’s signature Falabella handbag, that was later featured in the Victoria & Albert Museum’s Fashioned from Nature exhibition.
