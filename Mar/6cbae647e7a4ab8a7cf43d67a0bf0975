BLACK Leopards coach Lehlohonolo Seema does not believe the Fifa international break will kill the momentum Black Leopards have been trying to build. On Sunday, bottom-of-the-table Lidoda Duvha came from behind to snatch a 1-1 draw against DStv Premiership leaders Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld, thanks to a late strike from Roderick Kabwe. But the point earned against the log leaders was not enough as they remain rooted to the bottom of the Premiership table. After 20 matches, Leopards have managed to collect only13 points. According to Seema, the break gives them a breather as the mood has been down after some matches where they failed to get any points. Seema said: “The past few weeks after every game, when we did not get a result, the mood was down but it is up to us as the technical team to pick them up at training and try to show them it is not over.” On his side’s away point against the defending champions, Seema said: “The players stuck to the plan and we worked hard. We will take this one point because any point that we can put on the board is crucial. “We needed the Fifa break. There are many things we need to do and some guys need to recover from knocks. The past month and a half has been hectic. We have been travelling a lot. “It (the break) comes at the right time. Players will go (away) and clear their minds as we have not been getting results week in, week out.” Leopards are three points behind fellow strugglers Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), who are15th, and Seema’s side are four adrift of Maritzburg United and Chippa United, who are in positions 14 and 13 respectively with 17 points each.
