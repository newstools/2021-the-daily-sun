ORLANDO Pirates are eager to narrow the gap between them and pace-setters Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday (5pm) when they host Bloemfontein Celtic in a DStv Premiership game at Orlando Stadium. Pirates are seven points behind Downs on 29 points from 18 matches. But Sundowns have two games in hand compared to Bucs. Pirates will go into the match with their heads held up high having progressed to the last eight of Nedbank Cup after beating Maritzburg United 3-1 away at the weekend. On the other hand, Celtic are looking forward to avenge the two defeats suffered at the hands of Bucs in the first round 1-0 via the boot of Siphesihle Ndlovu. As if that was not enough, Pirates ended their six-year trophy drought at the expense of Siwelele in December last year when they beat them 2-1. Pirates have managed to beat Celtic 11 times at home compared to seven matches for the visitors, while seven matches were drawn. Bucs have won two of their last five PSL matches with two draws and one defeat. They will now need to tighten their defence to avoid conceding, having collected the ball in their next five times in five league games. Siwelele have targeted a top eight finish for the second year in a row under the guidance of coach John Maduka. Celtic have a similar record of two wins, two losses and one draw. Pirates will go into the match without influential midfielder Thabang Monare, who is suspended having picked up his fourth yellow card against Maritzburg at the weekend. Meanwhile, Celtic will play without key defender Tshepo Rikhotso, who is also suspended after being sent-off in their 1-1 draw against Chippa United.
