Iâ€™VE often said that there are two things that make the world go round. The obvious, money, and of course, the punani. I know many might be taken aback by this, but these two fundamental commodities play an integral role in the ecosystem called life. While one has purchasing power, the other gives birth to life as we know it. The punani, according to many sexologists, is one of the most intriguing parts of the human body. It comes in different sizes and shapes, much like there are various types of 4-5s. According to Yahoo Lifestyle, there are five types of punanis: 1. The open curtain This is a punani where the labia minora extends out past the labia majora either a little bit or a whole lot. It is the most common punani among women. 2. The Barbie doll This is the least common type of punani as the labia minora are completely hidden inside the labia majora and both sets of lips rest on the pelvic bone. 3. Puffy These look similar to the Barbie, but the lips sit lower on the pelvic bone and are either puffed up or thin and hanging. 4. The tulip This flower-looking punani has a labia minora which is slightly showing throughout the whole length of the labia majora. 5. The horseshoe This type is when the punani opening is wider at the top, which exposes the labia minora, but the labia majora touch towards the bottom and stop the labia minora from extending below them.
