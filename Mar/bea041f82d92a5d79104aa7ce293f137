Mamelodi Sundowns striker Kermit Erasmus has praised his side’s clinical approach in their Caf Champions League outing against Algerian side CR Belouizdad. The Brazilians were ruthless, thumping Belouizdad 5-1 in the Group B encounter played in Tanzania on Sunday. Erasmus was on the scoresheet alongside striker partner Peter Shalulile and Lebohang Maboe. But it was Themba Zwane who stole the show with a brace. “Travelling has been good, we came here to do a job and that's to get to collect the three points and we managed to win convincingly," Erasmus said to the club’s social media team. "It was a good game for us, but in the first-half were not at our best. (In the) second half, we were better, we increased the intensity with an extra man. "So, we finished the chances that we created and that is the most important thing beyond the victory. We played well, from the defence to the midfield to the attack. "We created enough chances for us to score and you can see the scoreline of 5-1. We lost a bit of concentration in the first half and we conceded a goal. "I am happy that we won. It is an important win for us. We go back home and have a little bit of a rest and go away to Congo. So, it is a good step in the right direction, we hope to continue this way."
