"On behalf of the National Soccer League, we celebrate the ascendency of Dr Patrice Motsepe to the highest pinnacle of football administration in the continent," the PSL chairman said in a statement issued by the league. "It appears to us that he had a premonition when he joined the PSL for the first time. He was the only club owner who was called President and today it is a reality. We wish him well on the journey ahead." Addressing a gathering of Africa's member associations at the elections venue in Morocco, Motsepe stressed his belief in how unity can herald a new era for African football, which has been mired in controversy in recent times. "It's a huge honour and privilege for me (to be elected as Caf president)," said Motsepe. "Let me thank my brother (Fifa president) Gianni (Infantino) for the vision and encouragement of unity. We can only deal with the challenges of Africa and we will succeed, but we will only do so when we are united."
