THOSE failing to abide by the road rules this Easter will have nowhere to hide. This is because the Limpopo Transport and Community Safety MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya has launched the provincial Easter Road Safety Campaign in Polokwane on Friday. The province is anticipating high traffic volumes as thousands of road users will be heading home. Most of the vehicles are expected on the N1 between Pretoria and the Beitbridge border post. The provincial and district roads will also be extremely full during the holidays. Lerule-Ramakhanya said the influx will require her department to heighten visibility of law enforcers on the roads in the form of operations and speed cameras. She told her traffic cops not to hide in the trees but to be visible on the roads. “Nearly 60% of Limpopo people work outside the province and most of them will be coming home for Easter so all our roads will be flooded.” “Compliance should start with us. Our visibility will be heightened from today especially on the N1 and R71 roads as they are the accidents hotspots. We must always remember that a careless mistake could lead to a serious accident,” said Lerule-Ramakhanya. She handed over 70 new vehicles to traffic cops. Of the 70, 36 are vans. She said traffic cops will now be able to arrest motorists on the spot, especially those owing traffic fines. “Our behaviour will determine whether we’re on our path back to our normal lives or we experience the third wave,” Lerule-Ramakhanya warned. The operations will end on 6 April. Acting provincial police commissioner Major General Samuel Manala said the key to approach Easter is to be ready as it is unpredictable. “We will work hand in hand with traffic cops in making sure we minimise road accidents and fatalities on our roads so our people can be safe. Taxi drivers must obey the law as there are some who are not doing so,” he said. Lesego Mathobela of Santaco urged their taxi drivers to comply at all times.
