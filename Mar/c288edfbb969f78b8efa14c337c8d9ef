ZULU King Goodwill Zwelithini has
been described as a king who had respect for everyone. King Zwelithini died on Friday
morning at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital in Durban after being hospitalised
for about a month. His younger brother Prince Mbonisi
Zulu told Daily Sun the king was like a father to them after their
father King Cyprian Bhekuzulu died. “My father passed away when I was
only eight years old but when he took the throne he become a father to us. He
was a born king. He respected men and women. “The biggest tree has fallen. I
asked people to keep praying for us because this is a hard time for the royal
family to even think positively because the king had been hospitalised more
than a month,” he said. Prince Thiza Zulu told Daily Sun
that he grew up with the king at KwaDlamahlahla Royal Palace and the king was a
year older than him.  “At a young age he had great respect
and gave people food but he was harsh when someone attacked him. He always
offered me food when we were growing up together. “He had respect to everyone
regardless of their age. Even if he wanted you to do something for him, he
would not force you because he is the king. He always asked nicely.” Prince Thiza said the king loved
farming and he always encouraged his nation to farm and produce their own food. King Zwelithini’s cousin from his
mother’s side, Mkhaleleni Ndwandwe, told Daily Sun: “He always brought
groceries to us saying he don’t want us as his mother’s home to starve. He
respected us while he respected the whole nation,” he said. On Friday, princes from different
Zulu royal households gathered outside the palace to comfort each other. Dignitaries and mourners are
expected to arrive on Saturday and Sunday to mourn with the Royal House.
