REAL Madrid will square off against rivals Atletico Madrid on Sunday in a La Liga derby expected to produce a winner, and not end in a stalemate like majority of games in the Spanish League. Third placed Real (with 53 points) will be looking to move to within two points of the La Liga leaders, under coach Diego Simeone, who are at the summit with 58 points from 24 matches. Barcelona are second with 53 – separated with Real by only goal difference. Los Blancos are unbeaten in their last five matches in Spain’s top flight, collecting 13 points from a possible 15 to remain in contention for the league crown. But Monday’s 1-1 draw against Real Sociedad has halted the club’s momentum at a time when Zinedine Zidane is having to contend with a well-populated treatment room. Real on Sunday will make do without services of Carvajal, who suffered a recurrence of a hamstring problem against Valencia earlier, and the right-back is now facing another period on the sidelines. Ramos, who still has not signed a new deal with the side, underwent a knee operation earlier this month to address a meniscus issue, and the club captain is not expected to be available until next month. Benzema has missed their last three matches with an ankle problem, and Zidane has suggested that the Frenchman will feature at the weekend providing that he comes through training this week. Real’s next outing is a big one as they travel to the Wanda Metropolitano since 21 November, having faced away trips to Villarreal, Sevilla, Éibar, Elche, Osasuna, Alaves, Huesca and Valladolid. In this run of matches, a whole host of players have weighed in with goals. A total of seven madridistas have found the net (plus an own goal).
