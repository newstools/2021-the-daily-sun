Police in
Mpumalanga are searching for a suspect who allegedly shot and killed a Fidelity
security guard during an apparent robbery in Zwelisha, near Pienaar on
Wednesday. A second
suspect was shot and killed during the incident. "According
to information received, the guard and his colleague were escorting a truck
from Clover for deliveries when they were approached by two unknown suspects.
The suspects, both armed with firearms, cornered the Fidelity vehicle. However,
one of the guards reacted swiftly and shot one of the suspects," police
spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said. The
remaining robber retaliated and shot the guard, who was sitting on the
passenger's side of the vehicle. The perpetrator then fled the scene. "All
role players were summoned to the scene, where both the guard and suspect were
certified dead," Hlathi said. Police
didn't indicate if any money was taken. Preliminary
investigations have revealed that the getaway vehicle belonged to the deceased
suspect's parents. It was later found abandoned near the Kabokweni police
station. "Police
appeal to the public to assist with information that may lead to the arrest of
the remaining suspect to contact Detective Captain Vusimuzi Thobela at 082 469
1956, or call the Crime Stop number at 08600 10111," Hlathi said. SOURCE:
