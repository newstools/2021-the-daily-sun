JOBURG MMC for Housing Mlungisi Mabaso went on a walk-about at Noord Taxi Rank on Thursday, 11 March. But he did not receive a warm welcome from the taxi drivers, who told him to voetsek. They said they felt disrespected that Mabaso and the media went to the rank without asking for their permission. They said the rank was their office and people couldn’t come and go as they pleased.  “You people always come here and walk around, looking at us like we are senseless. “Instead of deploying people to clean up this mess, you tell us we are the ones causing it. What are we supposed to do!” asked an angry taxi driver. Walking about, Mabaso was shocked to see the state of the rank as rubbish piled up and the smell of urine filled the rank. He told Daily Sun the purpose of his walk-about was to identify all the spots that needed urgent attention. “I wasn’t aware things had gone from bad to worse. The pilled-up garbage is clearly a year old,” he said. Mabaso said there were a lot of illegal activities in the rank.  “There’s illegally connected electricity and water, women cooking in a filthy environment and drug addicts loitering around. I’ve seen all that I need to see in order to make sure services are delivered to our taxi ranks,” he said. Mabaso said the JPC will start cleaning up the ranks as of Thursday night escorted by the JMPD. He vowed to bring change and make sure people tasked with certain jobs did them.
