Mpumalanga police have urged residents of Mashishing and Sabie to stop destroying property. This follows violent service delivery protests which started on Thursday last week. The residents were demanding water, proper roads and affordable electricity tariffs. They called for the removal of Mayor Fridah Nkadimeng and accused him of corruption. The residents allegedly torched a supermarket on Tuesday, 9 March and destroyed business properties in the area. They allegedly set alight municipal offices, damaged an Absa ATM and tried to steal money. Shops, some belonging to foreigners, were looted and roads damaged. Residents of Sabie said they were protesting over letters notifying them about outstanding electricity bills. They were told if they don’t pay or make arrangements, their power will be switched off. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said looting of shops, as well as blocking and destruction roads, was uncalled for. At least 13 people were arrested, but seven cases were thrown out of court and six people granted free bail. They’ll be back in the Lydenburg Magistrates Court on Monday, 15 March. Thaba Chweu municipal spokesman, Ezrom Sekgobela, said the continued acts of vandalism weighed negatively on the budget of the municipality. “This is money that could have been channelled towards addressing other pressing needs and priorities,” he said. He said proper engagement with the protest leaders will take place to find solutions.
