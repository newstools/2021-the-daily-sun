IT might seem like a good idea to use idliso on your man. But izangoma say it ends in tears. Gobela Mntimande Ngwenya told Daily Sun using it is fun while it lasts. He said a man does what the woman wishes, but the worst should be expected as soon as it wears off. “We know that women use it to keep their men in check. It’s like a control measure used to stop a man from cheating,” said Mntimande. He said this temporary measure wears off and makes the man aggressive and violent, and he’s likely to slap around his partner. “Men are on their best behaviour when idliso is used on them,” he said. “They want to stay home all day and even ditch their friends because they have unexplainable fear of their partner. “At that point, even if the man’s family tells him muthi was used on him, he won’t listen. Instead, he’ll turn his back on his family.” Mntimande said as soon as the woman gets what she wants, she relaxes and forgets she has to renew idliso. “Unfortunately, idliso has to be renewed once in a while. If not, all hell breaks loose.” Gogo Nontsikazi Mtshali said: “Idliso is dangerous because it’s mixed with muthi that can lead to liver damage. “It also causes laziness to the point where the man might get fired or quit his job.” Gobela Gogo Nkomiyahlaba advised both men and women to stop forcing love.
