Tsotsi prophets, or whatever they call themselves these days, continue to mislead and hide behind God’s word. Testimony collected from church victims by various commissions, notably the CRL Rights Commission, is shocking, to say the least. Here’s the common modus operandi. . . Believe it or not, there’s a tendency among fake pastors or church leaders to do a background check. In the process, upon hearing truths being told to them by a stranger – an “annointed” one nogal – gullible souls lap it all up, hook, line and sinker. They tell you to come to Jesus Christ and you will receive anything you want, like success, business, a good life and all sort of miracles. Government is weak when it comes to regulating churc hes. Anyone can start a church anywhere in the country. So-called men of God take advantage of desperate people. That much is obvious. It hurts to see how such churches promise congregants heaven on earth. They’re told to give away a certain amount to the church every month. Parliament must do something before more people get raped and robbed by the so-called men of God. - Letter by Nelson Kgatla, Pretoria North
