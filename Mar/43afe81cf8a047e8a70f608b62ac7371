TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila chairman, Abram Sello, has set a new target for the team to reach the Nedbank Cup semi-final. In fact, so ambitious is Sello that he had a one hour meeting with all his players on Friday morning and told them to ensure they pull all the stops to win the trophy. It doesn't end there, Sello says they are hoping to complete the current season within the top eight bracket. "It's our dream. These are our two top targets - Nedbank Cup and top eight," said Sello on Friday. "Our dream will most definitely come true. I told the players that if we reach the top eight final, then God will decide. If we lose in the final then it wouldn't be a train smash but we will dust ourselves, hold our heads up and move on to the next challenge. "I'm very happy with the way the team is performing. We're working hard and win where we can, like any other team, we have big dreams and ambitions. The players are positive but were just disappointed by Golden Arrows this week (League clash, lost 2-1)." He said they are looking ahead to Sunday's Ke Yona Cup quarter-final clash against fellow Limpopo outfit Black Leopards at the Thohoyandou Stadium, where only one team will be standing. "This is a derby and it carries a lot of weight for us all, more importantly bragging rights," said the chairman. "I will do my part to help them, and they too as players and technical team must do their part. I need a formidable team."
