MZANSI students have been up in arms for several weeks, demanding free education. The EFF Student Command at the Durban University Technology has intensified the call for the Department of Higher Education and Training to respond to the #SizofundaNgenkani demands. DUT students didnâ€™t participate in the previous shutdown, with the SRC saying there were no students to participate. The institution reportedly would only allow students to register once Nsfas confirmed funding. In a video doing the rounds on social media, students can be seen fighting in the streets, allegedly on campus. The fighting students in red and yellow T-shirts are alleged to be EFFSC and Sasco members. #StudentProtest Chaos at Durban University of Technology.
