NTUTHUKO Shoba will be kept in jail while awaiting a bail judgment on Friday. Shoba, the alleged mastermind behind the killing of his girlfriend Tshegofatso Pule, made his second appearance in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court in Joburg yesterday. Shoba, looking neat and well dressed, is facing charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and defeating the ends of justice. The married JSE analyst was arrested for allegedly ordering a hit on Pule when she was eight months pregnant to hide the pregnancy from his wife. He was arrested at his home on the evening of Thursday, 25 February, after Muzikayise Malephane, the killer, confessed in a plea agreement that he had been hired to kill the heavily-pregnant woman. He said he was offered R70 000 by Shoba to kill Pule before his wife found out about her pregnancy. Malephane was recently sentenced to 20 years behind bars. He confessed to pretending to be from an e-hailing service and fetching Pule from Shobaâ€™s house in Florida last year. He then shot her before hanging her from a tree in Roodepoort to make it look like a suicide. Pule was discovered by a passerby four days after going missing. Malephane is expected to testify against Shoba when his trial starts.
