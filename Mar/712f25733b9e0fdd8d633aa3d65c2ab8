TRADITIONAL leaders should get involved in government programmes aimed at developing communities. This was the advice President Cyril Ramaphosa had when he responded to questions during a debate on a speech he gave to the House of Traditional Leaders on Thursday, 4 March. “Traditional leaders must not be bystanders in this process. Nothing must take place about you without you,” he said. Ramaphosa said traditional leaders were well positioned to ensure district plans responded to the needs of communities. He reminded them they could help bridge the gap between urban and rural people. “There is not a single traditional leader in this house who’s not aware of the crisis in their communities caused by mass migration to the cities,” he said. “It is you, the traditional leaders, who can play a key role in helping to stem this tide. Our rural areas must become centres of economic activity, industry and employment opportunity.” He said for rural communities to prosper, the divide in access to resources needed to be tackled. Ramaphosa said the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan would trigger massive investment in infrastructure, much of which would be in rural areas. “Our economic recovery must also involve the development of local production and industrialisation,” he said. “This must happen in rural and under-developed areas if it is going to benefit all South Africans.” Ramaphosa accepted criticism from traditional leaders during the debate, when they complained that ministers were not implementing government resolutions.
