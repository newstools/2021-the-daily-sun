THE videotape containing the altercation involving EFF leader Julius Malema and party MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi was in high demand. According to Deon Klingbiel, who worked at the Fourways Memorial Park when Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was buried there in 2018, three senior officers wanted the videotape. He didn’t know about the incident until police came looking for it. During his testimony at the Randburg Magistrates Court yesterday, Klingbiel said: “Colonel Bronkhorst told me about the incident and wanted to know if there’s a possibility it was on tape. “I told him it’s possible as it happened at the entrance of the cemetery. I said he should come back later so we could go through the footage.” Klingbiel said Bronkhorst told him the video was for internal use and the police would ask him to keep it safe. “Colonel Seanego contacted me and wanted photos of the incident. He requested the photos just after the funeral. I put the photos on the CD for the colonel,” he said. Klingbiel gave the video to Colonel Johannes Venter, who’d been allegedly assaulted by Malema and Ndlozi. Colonel James Bronkhorst gave details on security measures around big events such as high-profile funerals. He couldn’t say whether or not the vehicle transporting Malema and Ndlozi was part of the convoy, or if it had a permit. “I was not part of the team at Orlando Stadium,” he said. “Security measures have to be followed if motor vehicles don’t have accreditation. “People in the car have to be cleared and the vehicle would be escorted to the sterile (safe) area.”
