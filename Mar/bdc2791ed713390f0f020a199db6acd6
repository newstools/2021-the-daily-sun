CHIPPA United have confirmed the signing of veteran midfielder Oupa Manyisa. Manyisa has been signed by the Chilli Boyz on a short-term deal until the end of the season. However, the Eastern Cape club has enlisted a one-year option to renew. The 32-year-old former Orlando Pirates captain’s future has been rescued after leaving Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) whom he joined at the beginning of the season. However, he was let go by the Limpopo side without kicking a ball. “We are proud to announce the signing of midfielder, Oupa “Ace" Manyisa until the end of the season, with an option of a one-year extension,” said Chippa statement.“ The 32-year-old carries a decorated football career with 31 international caps for South Africa. Manyisa is available for selection contention as the Chilli Boys resume the DStv Premiership campaign against Maritzburg United in Pietermaritzburg this Saturday. Manyisa will be reunited with Anthony Laffor, whom he worked in his short stint with Mamelodi Sundowns before leaving at the end of last season. Manyisa is one of the most successful footballers in the PSL. He has won five league titles in total, three Nedbank Cups, two MTN8 trophies and two Telkom Knockout trophies. Chippa coach Dan Malesela has welcome Manyisa’s signing. “I am elated to have the player of Oupa's talent and experience joining us. He will play an integral role in this team as we head to the last stretch of the season with the league and the Nedbank Cup,’’ said Malesela. “We do have a tough schedule with back-to-back fixtures and we are aiming at finishing strong in our remaining matches. “With captain Andile Mbenyane also still recovering from his groin injury, Oupa will provide the experience that this team needs alongside the likes of Anthony Laffor, Freddy Nsambiyumva and Kurt Lentjies can provide.”
