DID you know that Patrice Motsepe rocked worn-out soccer boots this weekend in front of world football president, Gianni Infantino? This Friday he'll be ordained as the next CAF President after his close competitors withdrew their candidature to support him at the next General Assembly in Morocco.  So humble is the ARM Chairman and Blue Bulls boss that he opted to wear his 1979 soccer boots that he used to wear in Mmakau, Ga-Rankuwa, his paternal home where his father ABC Motsepe, was chief. And he treasured the boots that come close to Adidas' 1979 Copa Mundial, which managed to survive the release of several generations of soccer boots. Reports suggests that Copa Mundial still remains one of the top selling boots in the world, and Motsepe dribbled past Ivory Coast’s Jacques Anouma‚ Senegal’s Augustin Senghor and Mauritania’s Ahmed Yahya, who dropped out of the CAF race in support of Motsepe, when they played in an exhibition match this past weekend. Now, this must be a lesson that money cannot buy you style, keep it simple and be successful like Motsepe. How did Patrice Motsepe end up here ?? pic.twitter.com/DzKLR5Kt8k
