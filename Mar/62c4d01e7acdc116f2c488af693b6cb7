ALTHOUGH the fight for financial exclusion is far from over, the Wits SRC has started assisting students to register for the 2021 academic year. SRC president Mpendulo Mfeka told Daily Sun the aim was to raise R21 million. So far, only R4 million had been raised. The SRC remained hopeful more money would be raised. Mfeka said: “We’d started a campaign about two months ago to try and raise 21 million in 2021. “That campaign is only getting more money now, and we’ve received a donation from numerous people, corporates and NGOs.” According to Mfeka, not all students would benefit from the fund-raising campaign as they had criteria in place to help select deserving, qualifying students. “We’ve also taken into account special cases like students who were unable to perform as well as they could have if it weren’t for Covid-19.” He said some students were in remote areas and didn’t have the necessary systems to do their work. “Some were in townships and didn’t have the space to allow them to perform as they could in any other environment.” To apply, Mfeka said a motivational letter stating financial need and a recent academic transcript should be submitted. “If the transcript is not good, in the motivational letter the student will be required to explain the reason for underperformance. We’d also want proof of financial household income,” he said.
