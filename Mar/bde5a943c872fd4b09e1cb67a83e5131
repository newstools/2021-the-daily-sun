ENCA management has committed to having programmes that will shed light on race and relation issues for their staff. Their hand was forced, following the criticism the channel has been facing since last week. This was after their reporter Lindsay Dentlinger became a story while covering a story. The channel’s managing director, Norman Munzelele, said: “We will do everything possible within our powers as the eNCA to ensure that we transform, to ensure that our journalists or management are aware of racial issues in the country. “We understand it is a sensitive issue of race and race ration issues and as yesterday we will have programmes that implementing that touches our journalist.” The journalist and the channel came under fire and accused of racism after some white guests where interviewed without masks and black guest were asked to keep theirs on. On Tuesday the ANC members, led by the party’s deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte, picketed outside the channels headquarters in Hyde Park, Joburg and handed over a memorandum of demands.  “We are extremely disappointed, to what the whole world saw, over and over again where a person in your employ, not only once, twice, three times and on other occasions as well interviews a black person and say put your mask and cover your nose,” said Duarte. “But when they interview a white person, it ok (without a mask) because corona is black persons disease that is the attitude of the management. “You yourselves must take this person, through a process of rehabilitation and you must be able to come to the world and say she is now rehabilitated.”  Munzhelele said: “We accept the memorandum. We hear the demands and I want to give you our commitment as the eNCA, as I said yesterday, that the eNCA does not exist in a vacuum, it exist in SA, which is a constitutional democracy.” He said the channel commits its self to contributing to building a non-sexist and non-racial South Africa as they were given seven days to respond.
