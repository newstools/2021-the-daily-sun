THE parents of pupils at Laerskool Danie Malan in Pretoria North locked horns reportedly over the inclusion of English classes at the school on Wednesday morning. When the SunTeam arrived at the school it was quiet, and the security guard refused to talk. Parents were coming to pick up the children as normal. But it’s reported that early in the morning parents squared off at the school. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “We’re aware of incidents happening around the said school this morning, 24 March. “Accordingly, we’ve placed all pupils in that area. We provided alternative spaces which some parents don’t want,” said Mabona “Indeed, schools in that area have reached capacity. To a certain extent some schools went as far as increasing their capacity to accommodate more pupils but still we have a challenge. “Well, that area is growing and there are not enough schools. Indeed, some schools need to increase a number of English classes, but we must persuade rather than push.”
