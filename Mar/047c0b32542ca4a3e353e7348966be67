IT is no secret that the arrival of Benni McCarthy at AmaZulu has brought positive energy. The Bafana Bafana all-time leading goal-scorer joined Usuthu in December replacing Ayanda Dlamini who opted to step down just after six games in the 2020-21 season. Since his arrival, McCarthy has overseen nine league matches. In those games, he managed to win four, drew four and only lost one. On Tuesday afternoon, Usuthu will be out to maintain their much-improved league run when they host SuperSport United at Kings Park Stadium (5pm). Usuthu captain Tapelo Xoki admits that they have improved in their last league matches and they are looking to make Kings Park their fortress. “A very important match for us, which gives us a chance to bounce back from the (Nedbank) defeat over the weekend,” Xoki said. “We have been doing well in the league recently and some results have also been very good. We want to keep up that momentum and make sure that we make Kings Park a difficult place for any team that comes here.” Early this year, the two teams played to a 1-1 draw, with SuperSport getting a late equaliser through Bradley Grobler, who scored from a spot-kick. Xoki is confident they can emerge victorious on the day. He said: “We played them in January and I thought we should have won that game. So, we know that they (SuperSport) are a team we can beat if we apply ourselves correctly and do what we are instructed to do. “We have enough confidence that we can win. We just have to fight, match their effort and their resilience, then we are good to go.” A win for SuperSport will see them catching up with log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns who are top of the table with 36 points.
