DRIVING on wet or snowy roads requires special attention and not taking risks. But for this Mercedes-Benz AMG CLA 45 driver, it was better for him to arrive faster at his destination than safe. In a video published by Supercars of New York, the Benz can be seen driving behind a VW Tiguan before speeding and crashing into a Smart Fortwo. Following that the Benz continues and smashes into three other cars on the side of the road.
