With over 7.2 million people roaming the streets with no hope of securing jobs and our Corona infection rates dropping, president Cyril Ramaphosa had no choice but to move the country into level 1 restrictions to try everything to give the economy a chance to recover. The Covid-19 pandemic only worsened an already stagnant economy that has seen many of our people rotting at the bottom of the economic pile. Not even crumbs have been falling from that table as the economy continued to shed jobs with various companies folding. Adding to our concerning unemployment levels has been the deepening poverty and hunger in many households. Dear Sun Family, level one freedoms are not about the opening up of more hours to buy alcohol at taverns and shebeens and to start partying in large gatherings. It is not about letting our guard down and having regular get-togethers with our loved ones. The threat of a third and fourth wave is just around the corner. With winter approaching and with our slow rollout of the vaccine programme, we may only see progress regarding our herd immunity towards the end of this year. Level 1 freedoms mean we have to be extra vigilant as we now circulate and move around more. We can never let our guard down and risk getting infected and also infecting our loved ones and families. Let's be vigilant and responsible and continue to practice all the safety measures to keep the virus at bay.
