Mpumalanga-born and raised trio KasiTime gives Mzansi some motivation on their new single. KasiTime, which is made up of Thami “T Square” Masinga, Lwazi “Glits Arii” Mhlongo and Sbusiso “K Stunning” Masinga, released their single titled Up Sokisi on Monday, 1 March. Speaking to SunBuzz, T Square of the hip hop group said Up Sokisi is to inspire people to do better. “Firstly, the song has a nice sound,” he said. “We fuse our hip hop with new age kwaito. Up Sokisi is a term we used to tell people to get up and do better. “Take their lives to the next level and do great in whatever they’re doing. “When we wrote it, we wanted to encourage people to push and not give up on their dreams. It also celebrates people who work hard.” The group was formed in 2013, after T Square and K Stunning met Glits Arii. “K Stunning is my brother and we grew up singing together,” said T Square. “We met Glits Arii in 2013 because we recorded at the same studio.

That was big for us. “Sadly, the single that we released after Converse wasn’t successful, but we didn’t give up. “We kept on working until we released Amahlukuba last year. “That song did very well. We shot the music video for it and it was rotating on radio and TV stations. “We then decided to release a whole EP titled Int’esile and it also did very well.” They’re currently working on their second EP. “We’ll release it in the second quarter of the year,” said T Square. “We’ll feature AB Crazy and we’re still negotiating with other people, whom we want to feature.”
