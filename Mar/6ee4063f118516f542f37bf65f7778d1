INTERNATIONAL football will take a front row seat in the next coming weeks. We will finally see the end of the extended 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifying campaign. The qualifiers started in November 2019 and should have been completed last September, but the Covid-19 pandemic caused havoc with the international calendar. The Afcon finals scheduled for Cameroon was also postponed until January/February next year due to the pandemic. Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki will name his squad today for the final two crunch Afcon qualifiers against Ghana at FNB Stadium on 25 March and Sudan three days later in Khartoum. Ntseki has been running the rule over his players for what will be two make or break qualifiers. Bafana and Ghana head Group C with nine points each, while Sudan have six points heading into the final straight. SunSport looks at some of the new players and some who Ntseki is looking at recalling. This will be the Bafana coach’s most important squad announcement since he replaced Stuart Baxter in August 2019. The 30-year-old has featured in 11 games for Usuthu and has kept four clean sheets. His presence in goals for AmaZulu has helped the Durban outfit reach sixth position on the DStv Premiership table. Sipho Mbule (SuperSport United): He was unfortunate to be pulled off in two friendly matches against Namibia and Zambia last October due to an injury. But Mbule is back to his best and Ntseki is expected to call up the young man, who has been prominent in United’s title chase this season. The 22-year-old midfielder has scored two goals in 16 league appearances. Striker Gamildien has impressed and although goals have dried up a bit for him, he deserves to add to the two caps he earned in friendly matches in 2013.
