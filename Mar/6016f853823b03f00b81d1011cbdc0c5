MZANSI cops seized hundreds of fake COVID-19 vaccines following an alert by INTERPOL. They seized 400 ampoules, the equivalent of 2 400 doses containing the fake vaccine were found at a warehouse in Germiston, Ekurhuleni. Cops also recovered a large quantity of fake 3M masks and arrested three Chinese nationals and a Zambian national. The arrests came just weeks after Interpol issued an Orange Notice warning law enforcement to prepare for organised crime networks targeting Covid-19 vaccines, both physically and online. The alert also included details and images of genuine vaccines and authorised shipping methods provided by pharmaceutical companies to assist in the identification of fake vials.  “While we welcome this result, this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Covid-19 vaccine related crime,” said Interpol secretary general Jurgen Stock. Stock said following their warning that criminals would target the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, both on and offline, Interpol continues to provide its full support to national authorities working to protect the health and safety of citizens. This comes as South Africa is on an offensive against the Covid-19 virus and has started with the Johnson & Johnson vaccination.
