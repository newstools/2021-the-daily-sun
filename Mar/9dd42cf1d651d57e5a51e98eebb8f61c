FOUR police
officers from the Public Order Policing Unit are expected to appear at the
Joburg Magistrates Court on Wednesday, in connection with the murder of
Mthokozisi Ntumba. The cops
are also facing three charges of attempted murder and defeating the end of
justice. Last week,
when dispersing protesting students, police unleashed rubber bullets on
students. It is alleged that their actions subsequently led to the death of
Ntumba who was on the side of the road. His death
sparked nationwide outrage and ignited heavy criticism on the police. Meanwhile,
the student protest is also set to continue as students have vowed to protest
until their demands are met.
