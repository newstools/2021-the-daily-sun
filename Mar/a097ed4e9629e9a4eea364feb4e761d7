A police constable was killed in Delft, Cape Town, on Friday, Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said. "An off-duty police constable was shot and killed in Delft on Friday afternoon," Van Wyk said in a statement. He said the 40-year-old constable was based with the Mowbray SAPS. Last month, two officers were killed in an ambush and robbed of their firearms in the city. Sergeant Mnakwazo Mdoko and Constable Mninawa Breakfast came under attack while patrolling along Phumla Street in Bloekombos. They were both declared dead on the scene. A 32-year-old man arrested in connection with the murders appeared in the Blue Downs Magistrate's Court. Van Wyk said Friday's shooting occurred in Ravel Street in Delft South. "Hawks [Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation] detectives have undertaken the investigation. More details will follow," he said.
