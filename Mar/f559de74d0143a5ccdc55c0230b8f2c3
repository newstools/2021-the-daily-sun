HARD work has finally paid off for Peter Shalulile, who hit the ground running when he joined Mamelodi Sundowns at the start of the PSL season. Although Downs signed a few players this season, Shalulile seems to have surpassed all expectations to score 12 goals in 22 games in all competitions. The Namibian international has found the back of net seven times in 15 matches in the league, and his efforts were rewarded yesterday when he was crowned the DStv Premiership Player of the Month award for January and February. AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy walked away with the Coach of the Month award. Shalulile revealed that being surrounded by top players at Downs has made things easy for him. He formed a deadly partnership with Themba Zwane and Kermit Erasmus, who have scored 18 of 26 goals in the PSL so far. “It has been a dream come true because I wanted to play for Sundowns and do the things I’m doing now,” said Shalulile. “I can say hard work has paid off and I’m here doing what I know best, scoring goals.” At the weekend, the Tshwane giants made history when the beat TP Mazembe 2-1 in the Caf Champions League group stages in Lubumbashi in the DR Congo to continue with their fine start in the competition. Shalulile scored for Downs early before Lyle Lakay’s sweetly struck free kick stole all the points for the Mzansi side in the 89th minute. Sundowns top the group on nine points after three games, and they now have one foot in the door to progress to the knockout stages. Their win in the DRC means that they became the first side from Mzansi to win there and also ended Mazembe’s unbeaten home record in 52 Champions League matches. The last time the five times Champions League winners lost in this competition in Lubumbashi was in 2009 against Sudanese side Al Hilal.
