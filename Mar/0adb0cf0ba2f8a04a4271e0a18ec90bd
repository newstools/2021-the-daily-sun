MEDIA personality Mpho Letsholonyane and her soccer star husband Reneilwe are celebrating a decade of love. The presenter took to social media to wish the Highlands Park midfielder a happy anniversary. In a brief post Mpho, who’s usually cagey about her personal matters, said she’ll always be his. “I love you today, tomorrow and always. Over a decade of loving you and 3 years as your wife,” she wrote. “Through the ups and downs, I’ll continue to choose you until we’re old and grey. Happy anniversary my love.” The two lovebirds tied the knot back in 2018 in a colourful wedding ceremony that was a mixture of Tswana and Pedi cultures. ALSO READ: SHOCK OVER CHOMEE'S MILLIONS! At the time of their wedding the couple, who weathered some storms and reportedly got back together in 2015, took to social media to share snaps of their wedding ceremony. “The beginning of a lifelong journey. Thank you for all those that could make it,” she wrote. “I embrace all that my human comes with, including his culture. Yesterday, I was welcomed by my in-laws and got my new Tswana name (No, I won’t share here). He’s mine and I’m his.” A day ago Reneilwe, who’s fondly known to his fans as Yeye, also took to social media to appreciate how much of a good mother Mpho is to their children. “Being a parent isn’t easy and we’re always hard on ourselves when it comes to parenting. It’s been a journey that has challenges, but we live and learn every day so that we can do what we think is right for these two humans. “Mpho Letsholonyane makes it much easier with her support, being a mother and a wife while being a career woman. Entlek, can they be young again?” A post shared by ??PH?? ????????H??????N????N?? (@mpho_letsholonyane)
