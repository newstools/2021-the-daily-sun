It’s better to talk to people you trust about your problems instead of being silent and letting those problems kill you from the inside. It’s vital to be brave so they can help you solve the problems you’re faced with. You should remember that, as long as you don’t talk about problems bothering you, people won’t know that you have problems. The attitude of keeping silent about our social and personal problems is one of the root causes of some shocking suicides. Keeping silent about your problems will distress, frustrate and depress you, and destroy your life. The truth is, most problems we’re faced with are easily solved when we talk about them and seek sincere help. Fools might laugh when you tell them about your problems, but Good Samaritans won’t laugh at you and will willingly help you to solve your problems. Don’t assume everyone will laugh at you when you talk to them. Be wise and never let those who laugh at you when you tell them worry you. Never be silent about your problems. - Letter by Andries Roro Kabini, Rockville
