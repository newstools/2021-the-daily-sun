GLADAFRICA Championship outfit Pretoria Callies’ fairytale run in the Nedbank Cup continues. The Tshwane outfit beat Cape Town All Stars 4-3 on penalty shootouts after the match ended 2-2 in regulation time at the Danie Craven Stadium on Sunday. The ten-men Callies were made to sweat, however, as they had to come from behind twice in the match. Pogiso Mahlangu and Edwin Sitayitayi were on the scoresheet for Callies while Waseem Isaacs and Pule Maraisane scored for All-Stars. Callies’ debut season in the Nedbank Cup has been a good one and it is set to continue as they make their way into the semi-finals. The Tshwane outfit, who won promotion to the Championship at the end of last season, have punched above their weight in this competition. They will be looking to emulate TS Galaxy and become only the second team from the second division of Mzansi football to win the competition. But they will have their work cut out for them as they are guaranteed to face top-flight opponents. The Championship rookies are the only team from the second division remaining in the competition. They seem to have a knack of beating All Stars as they also got the better of them in their last meeting in the league. The teams had last met in January in Cape Town, where the visitors Callies came away with a 2-1 victory. All Stars’ journey came to an end and so did their six matches unbeaten run in all competitions. Callies were the last team to beat All Stars who have been rejuvenated under Calvin Marlin. All Stars, though, will hold their heads high as they had not gone beyond the last 32 in four previous attempts ahead of this year’s competition. Issacs, who had scored in All Stars’ league defeat to Callies, opened the scoring in the 33rd minute but Mahlangu equalized in the second half. All Stars thought they had won it through Maraisane, but Callies fought back once again as Sitayitayi drew them level and send the match to extra time and ultimately penalties.
