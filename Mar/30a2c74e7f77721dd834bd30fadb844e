FORMER Bidvest Wits midfielder Gerald Phiri Jnr has vowed that his Baroka FC team will end this season in the top eight. Bakgakga host unpredictable Stellenbosch in their DStv Premiership clash at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday (5pm). A win for the Limpopo side will see them back in the top eight with 12 matches left to end the season. Thoka Matsimela side are currently ninth on the log with 21 points from 18 games. “It is tough and painful to fight for relegation and this season we don’t want that,” said Phiri. “This season we set our goal to qualify for the top eight. And so far we are in a good position and all we have to do is to keep fighting and make sure we get results at home. The good thing is that we have a strong team this season. “It is nice to talk about top eight and that is pushing us to make sure we make it. I am positive that we will achieve our goal.” Asked about his contribution to the team this season, the Malawian international, who has been used mostly as a substitute, said: “This is not about me but the whole team. I can’t complain as I have been playing and working hard all the time. I am happy to be with Baroka. “All I want is to see the team doing well. We have a good relationship as a team and we support the coach’s decisions. Every player is contributing to the team.” On their clash against the Stellies, Phiri, who scored a goal the last time the two sides clashed with Baroka winning 3-1, said: “They are a tough side to play against. But for us, it is about fighting for points to reach the top eight. It will be a tough game, but we are ready for them.” Steve Barker’s team are full of confidence after beating their Cape Town rivals Cape Town City 2-1 over the weekend, while Bakgakga drew 0-0 with Golden Arrows.
