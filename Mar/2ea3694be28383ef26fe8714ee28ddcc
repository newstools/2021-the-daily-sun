MBHAQANGA artists have written to President Cyril Ramaphosa complaining that they are not getting airtime on Ukhozi FM. Sipho Phoswa, a representative of the artists, told Daily Sun they tried engaging the station’s management, but were ignored. “Since early last year, we’ve been trying to engage management, but they have been ignoring us,” he said. “At first, I was told they didn’t have enough mbhaqanga music. “This is not true as I took it upon myself to hand deliver new music.” Sipho said he was later told the music he submitted did not meet SABC standards. “I resubmitted the music and asked if everything was in order, but there was no response from them. I’ve written email after email to query this issue, but they simply ignored me,” he said. Sipho claimed when the station happened to play their music, they didn’t give credit to the artists. “When they play mbhaqanga music, it’s always at night when only a few people can enjoy it. When they play it during the day, it’s usually old songs and they don’t give credit. “Because of these grievances, we’ve done our own investigation and discovered our music is not being played because we don’t pay payola,” he said. Daily Sun is in possession of emails regarding the matter dating back as far as early last year. Sipho said if artists didn’t get answers, they would march to the SABC studios. Acting SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said they were aware of the complaint and had dealt with the matter. “The station went through his submissions and music that met the criteria was playlisted. It must be noted that mbhaqanga music is playlisted during the day, and it’s a mix of old and new music,” said Seapolelo. The SunTeam also learnt that SABC KZN general manager Busani Mthembu responded to the artists and proposed a meeting to resolve their issues.
