KAIZER Chiefs captain Ramahlwe Mphahlele says they are bracing themselves for a tough challenge in the Caf Champions League. Amakhosi are in Luanda, Angola for their Group C clash against Petro de Luanda at the Estádio 11 de Novembro on Tuesday (6pm). The Glamour Boys are eager to bag another win over the Angolan outfit, having beaten them 2-0 at FNB Stadium just over a week ago. But they are well aware that their opponent will pose a different threat at home as they look to make their home-ground advantage count. Mphahlele, however, insists that Amakhosi need to win at all cost if they are to keep their chances of progressing to the next round alive. “We have prepared well and are looking forward to the match,” said Mphahlele, who has returned from suspension. “We know that these Champions League teams play completely different football at home. “This will be a different Petro from the one we played in Johannesburg. We are expecting a different team altogether, but we have prepared well and analyzed them well and tried to break down their strong points. “We know they will go all out because they need to win, but the coaches have put up a good game plan. The most important thing is that we get three points so that we have seven points and enhance our chances of reaching the next round.” The Soweto giants haven't been great shakes domestically but they have looked the part in the Champions League.
