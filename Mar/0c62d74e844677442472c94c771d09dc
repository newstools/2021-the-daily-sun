AN Eastern Cape doctor and a few nurses are in hot water. They allegedly turned away pregnant Sinazo Mfanelo (29) three times. Sinazo had gone to Nontyatyambo Clinic on 7 March to deliver a baby. She was apparently seen by a doctor, given four tablets and told to go home. But she felt the same pain at 1am and went back to the clinic. She was told to wait for the doctor, who’d be available at 9am. Sinazo went to her boyfriend’s house, where she gave birth to a stillborn. PRISON POKE INMATE SERVING LIFE FOR RAPE! When she returned to the clinic, she was told there was no mortuary and she should go to the police station. But after travelling with her dead baby, Sinazo was also turned away at Vulindlela Police Station. She was later admitted at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital. The treatment she received caused an uproar in Mdantsane, East London, with residents staging a sit-in at the clinic on Monday, 15 March, calling for the staff involved to face the music. Health MEC Makhosazana Meth visited the clinic on Tuesday and was told by clinic boss Vukile Makhi the officials would face disciplinary action. Makhi said the officials were on leave but were asked to make statements. He said the official who treated Sinazo was not a midwife but a registered nurse.  “Two nurses saw her and the nurse who treated her was a junior. The nurse who was supposed to treat her has 10-year experience, but she was busy with the boyfriend. The doctor said he discussed the patient with the nurse, but the nurse said there was no discussion,” said Makhi. Makhi said the doctor never examined Sinazo when she first came. Makhi said the district manager sent investigators to the clinic. “Allegations that a file was not opened for her are also under investigation,” he said.
