THE 2020/21 GladAfrica Championship has not been a fruitful one for Cape Town Spurs, formerly known as Ajax Cape Town. After missing out on automatic promotion in the past two campaigns, the Ikamva-based outfit were expected to continue with their fight for promotion. But that has not been the case. Spurs finished the first round of the season rooted at the bottom of the table with just 14 points in 15 matches. They are equal on points with newbies Pondo Chiefs, who have found the going tough in the Championship after firing their coach Tshepo Motsoeneng. They are only separated by a goal difference. Spurs’ Kegan Johannes admitted their struggles and pointed out a couple of things they need to improve on. “Obviously, the season has been difficult,” Johannes admitted. “The work ethic is definitely there, just a lack of goals and a lack of concentration in certain departments, but going forward, we just need to focus on the job at hand. We will take it from there and am confident the wins will come.” Last season’s league runner-up will need to find their old form, or else they will go down to the wilderness, follow their Cape Town neighbours Santos FC who were relegated to ABC Motsepe League a couple of seasons ago. The-19-year-old Johannes, who has plus 50 appearances for Spurs, says their way up should start with their next league game. Early this month, the club retained well-travelled midfielder Toriq Losper who was developed by the club, having joined them as a nine-year-old. The 28-year-old is now expected to lead by example. Coach Ian Taylor said scoring goals has been one of their main concerns. He said: “I believe things would have been better if we managed to convert the chances we create. We need to be more clinical and maintain consistency.”
