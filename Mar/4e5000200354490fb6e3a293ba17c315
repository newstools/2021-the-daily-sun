THERE was a scuffle between cops and residents over stolen power cables over the weekend starting on Friday, 19 March. The tussle in Buffalo Pass squatter camp in Buffalo City, Eastern Cape, led to cops pepper-spraying residents and pointing guns at them, making people even angrier. Municipal spokesman Samkelo Ngwenya said cops were accompanying members of the city’s revenue protection services to remove illegal connections. He said while connections were being taken to a municipal truck, residents tried to remove them and police got involved. Ngwenya said the theft of electricity in the area was costing the municipality millions of rands and had led to constant power cuts in Highway Gardens. He said residents were using a stolen transformer to get electricity. “This is extremely dangerous, which was our reasoning for removing this illegal network,” he said “We want to commend the bravery of our law enforcement officers who refused to give in to the mob despite being outnumbered. “The officers also conducted themselves within the law by using minimum force in the form of pepper-spray and only resorted to drawing firearms when the situation escalated.” Ngwenya said the municipality was opening a criminal case against suspects as stolen infrastructure material was being used. He called on law-abiding community members to help identify the culprits. A resident, who refused to be named, said a gang of izinyoka was charging people who wanted electricity connections money. He said for a R500 one-off payment, houses could be connected. “People are desperate for electricity because they’re tired of waiting for the municipality to connect them,” he said. “This izinyoka syndicate is cashing in tens of thousands of rands. “Law enforcement is fighting a losing battle because the moment they leave people start reconnecting.”
