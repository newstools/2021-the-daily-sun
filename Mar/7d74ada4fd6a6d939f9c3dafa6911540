DID the king die of Covid-related complications or not? As this question swirled after the king’s death was announced on Friday, confusion reigned when the prime minister in the royal household, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, failed to say clearly what the cause of death was. The message first went out earlier, insisting the king died of diabetes complications, only for the royal house to trip over their own words as they tried in vain to explain the king had contracted Covid-19, but was cleared of it by the time of his passing. This confusion and hair-splitting was not only unnecessary, but it was also an opportunity missed by the royal family to give some leadership about the Covid pandemic. It came out later that there are tensions within the family when other family members went out of their way to talk to the media to deny that the king died of Covid-related complications. King Zwelithini earned the respect of many when he spoke his mind about pertinent national issues and uncomfortable truths during his reign. The king led the way in the fight against HIV and Aids when other leaders were Aids denialists and caused many deaths among our people with their irresponsible utterances. He revived both the reed dance and male circumcision, banned during King Shaka’s time, to lead the fight against HIV. To honour his legacy, the royal family need to know that there’s more to gain in communicating clearly that the king died of Covid-19 complications. Trying to hide the cause only increases the discrimination still associated with this disease. – Editor
