POLICE Minister Bheki Cele and Gauteng police commissioner Elias Mawela are expected to visit the family of the man killed during the #FeesMustFall protest at Wits on Wednesday. Mthokosizi Ntumba (35) was killed when police fired rubber bullets at protesting students. Using a police Nyala, they chased students away and shot at them. That was when Ntumba, who was coming from a clinic, was shot and killed. Ndileka Cola of Ipid said they’d been notified by the Hillbrow cop shop about an incident that occurred in Braamfontein. “If this incident is within the mandate of Ipid, the normal investigation process will unfold,” said Cola. “When the preliminary investigation is finalised, the directorate will provide more details.” The civilian who was shot dead allegedly by police during the #asinamali protest is Mthokozi Mtumba. He had just obtained his Masters Degree.Police Minister visits his family.#justiceforMthokozisi#PoliceBrutality#FeesMustFall #BhekiCele #bladeMustFall @dailysunsa pic.twitter.com/AoyCrue5Xl
