ACTOR Jet Novuka is leaving Uzalo. He plays no-nonsense Captain Mpambani in the telenovela that airs on SABC1. The news of his departure was announced by Uzalo in a statement about the changes that had taken place for season seven. Jet is among three actors who are leaving the show. Confirming the news, Uzalo said: “We bid farewell to the much loved and revered community leader Qhabanga played by Siyabonga Shibe, head honcho and kingpin of KwaMashu MaNgcobo played by Dawn Thandeka King and judicious and unwavering lawmaker Captain Mpambani played by Jet Novuka. Stay tuned, these characters will exit the Uzalo world in an epic, drama-filled adieu.” New characters joining the telenovela are Mbali Maphumulo, who will be playing Phelelani’s mum, and Khabonina Qubeka is coming back.
