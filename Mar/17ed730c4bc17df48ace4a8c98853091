TAXIMEN have been urged to turn in foreigners who smuggle dagga across the border. Four Eswatini nationals were arrested after they were found wi th dagga on the N17 road towards the Oshoek border post on Monday. The men, aged between 29 and 42, were bust by patrolling traffic intervention unit members. The suspects were bust when the minibus taxis they were travelling in were stopped. Community Safety MEC Vusi Shongwe warned foreigners to respect the country’s laws. He urged taximen and communities along the border to help curb crossborder crimes by reporting suspicious people to the police. “Every person who wishes to visit the country should do so within the ambit of the law,” said Shongwe. “We frown on and deal harshly with those who do the opposite of what our law requires, irrespective of where they come from.” The four suspects are expected to appear in the Elukwatini Magistrates Court soon.
