Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandela coach, Dylan Kerr, has QUIT with immediate effect on Friday night. Word reaching SunSport is that the Englishman expressed his unhappiness about some clauses in his contract and declined to sign it. Kerr has long been given a contract by the club after chairman Abram Sello bought TTM from Masala Mulaudzi. The 54-year-old Kerr has been operating from behind the scenes on an advisory basis while still waiting for his work permit to be approved, but all are yet to be cleared and he opted NOT to agree terms with club. "He's gone. He was asked by the chairman to sign his contract because he cannot regard to himself as an employee of the club without a contract. He sent us a small text, and the chairman, telling us that he quits," said club's Liaising Manager Rufus Matsena on Sunday. David Mathebula and Mpho Maleka, who were supposed to be Kerr's assistant, will continue as joint coaches until end of the season. Kerr, who wanted to take over from sacked Joel Masutha at TTM, is not new to controversy as he left Black Leopards under a cloud where he had a fight with Lehlohonolo Seema when the latter joined the Venda-based outfit from Chippa United. Even before, Kerr had an episode with Baroka FC chairman Khurishi Mphahlele and accused the club boss of interference. Efforts to get comment from Kerr proved fruitless at the time of publishing, this is despite numerous attempts and his phone was constantly off.
