  The health department's technical adviser, Dr Aquina Thulare, said people who do not belong to medical aid schemes will be funded through the fiscus. She spoke during a briefing to Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Health on Friday, to outline the country's Covid-19 vaccine plans.  "Biovac will supply vaccines to private sector providers that will be vaccinating. There will be claims against the medical aid schemes that the members belong to. The schemes are going to pay for the vaccine, using a mechanism called the single exit price. This will go back into the fiscus to enable government to purchase more vaccines," she said. In January, the government announced it was looking at ways of recovering costs from insured patients. Schemes For those covered by medical aid, funding will be derived from schemes, even though it will be administered for free at the point of service. Thulare said there was also the option for uninsured patients to be vaccinated at a private facility.     "There will be a final determination of how the private sector will put in funding to augment the fiscus into purchasing the vaccines. The discussions are quite advanced," she said. Thulare said National Treasury will be guiding the process of how these funds can be deposited into the pot, which the fiscus will be using to purchase the vaccines. "The most important thing is that, even in those activities, we want to see the prioritisation and protocols that have been set out as to who gets vaccinated in phase one, phase two and three," she said.
