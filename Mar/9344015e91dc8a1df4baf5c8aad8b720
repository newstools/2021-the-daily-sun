TTM co-coach David Mathebula was delighted with a semi-final place in the Nedbank Cup after his side defeated Limpopo rivals Black Leopards 2-0 at the Thohiyandou Stadium on Sunday. TTM continued their recent revival as goals from Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo and Alfred Ndengane (penalty) sealed a historic semifinal place. “First half we did well by keeping the ball, the second half we were under pressure and it tested our defence. The team did well, stayed compact and forced them to play wide. When they put in crosses our two centre-halves did well,” Mathebula says. "I’m very happy for the players and technical team. Thanks to the [new] management too, the change there has played a major role [in improved results], you can see on the field of play the performance is getting better with each game. "We are coming back from a bad situation in our team and getting better, it is showing in our results in the league and the Nedbank Cup, where we are now in a semifinal.” Mathebula had special praise for Man of the Match Ndlondlo. "Ndlondlo has got all the qualities to play at the highest level, we have been encouraging him to keep it simple because sometimes he tries to be too complicated in his play. But today he was great, individuals are starting to come up and shine." TTM will now face the winner of the quarterfinal tie between Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates that will be played on April 15. But their next game is a DStv Premiership match away at AmaZulu on Sunday. -SuperSport
