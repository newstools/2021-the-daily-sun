WHEN the South African soldiers deployed at the South African and Zimbabwean border fence in Limpopo received a tip-off about a stolen luxurious BMW X6 that was about to be smuggled in to Zimbabwe, they set a trap. on Tuesday, a blue BMW SUV showed up driving through a bushy road towards Limpopo river at the old Gumbu Mine near Madimbo Operational Base outside Musina when the soldiers intercepted it. Acting spokesperson for the SANDF Captain Lwazi Malgas has commended the soldiers for their intervention and hard work.  She told Daily Sun that “when the suspects saw that there were soldiers stopping the vehicle, and the soldiers were giving chase, unfortunately they managed to cross the Limpopo River into Zimbabwe and they were prohibited to continue with the chase as it would be illegal for them,” Malgas said.  She added that the soldiers avoided shooting at the running suspects as they were not posing any danger by shooting at the soldiers. She said the stolen and recovered BMW X6 has been handed over to the police for more investigation and clearance purposes before it can be given back to its owner.
