BAFANA Bafana landed safe in Sudan for their last and crucial Afcon qualifier scheduled for Sunday at Al Hilal Stadium (4pm). The team arrived at the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, on Friday afternoon. Bafana arrived in Sudan without Andile Jali, who got injured against Ghana on Thursday, and defender, Sifiso Hlanti who was delayed but will be joining the team in Sudan on Saturday morning. Having held to a 1-1 draw by Ghana, who have already qualified for the Afcon finals, Bafana’s destiny is in their hands as they need at least one point in Omdurman on Sunday to book their place in the Afcon finals, scheduled to take place in Cameroon next year. Bafana are second in Group C with 10 points, same as Ghana, who have already qualified. A defeat will see Bafana failing to qualify for the tournament next year as the hosts need three points to secure a place. Bafana team doctor, Dr. Thulani Ngwenya, said the team will not be involved in physical training on Friday but will take lots of rest before going through the regeneration programme at the hotel swimming pool later in the evening. The team will then train at the match venue on Saturday before Sunday’s titanic clash. Looking ahead to the Sunday game, Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki said: “The group’s still very much open. And with Sudan playing at home, they’ll fancy the possibility of winning and qualifying. "But, from our assessment and analysis of Sudan and the players we have in camp, I think we’re capable of doing well in Sudan and qualifying.” Caf approved 1 000 fans to watch the match between Bafana and Sudan on Sunday, in line with Covid-19 regulations.
