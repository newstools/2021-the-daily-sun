Dear MizzB I AM a 28-year-old guy and have been single for the past five years. I’m always attracted to slay queens. They rejected me, and this has made me shy and afraid to approach ladies. How do I overcome this? Dear Brother People have different personality traits, and this impacts how they react when it comes to dating. Just because you’re shy doesn’t mean you’ll never date. The best way is for you to find a comfortable way to communicate when it comes to the ladies. Also, be mindful of the “type” of ladies you find yourself attracted to. You might not be their ideal partner. Like they say, stay in your lane and be happy. Good luck!
