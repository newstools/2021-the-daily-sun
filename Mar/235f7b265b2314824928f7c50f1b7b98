Three suspects who pretended to be the board of directors of
the City of Johannesburg and allegedly attempted to defraud the municipality of
almost R400 million, made their first appearance at the Rustenburg Magistrates
Court. Palesa Montana, Natasha Nakedi and Shirinda Mitimba were arrested
on Friday following an investigation into fraud and identity fraud, according
to the Hawks. "It's alleged that the three accused walked into an
Absa branch in Rustenburg and pretended to be board of directors for City of
Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality," said Hawks spokesperson Captain
Tlangelani Rikhotso. They reportedly presented fraudulent documents and ordered
the transfer of almost R400 million to be wired into 14 different trust
accounts. Rikhotso said the documents presented to the bank were,
however, confirmed as fraudulent and the matter was reported to the police who
then detained the three suspects. The matter was postponed to 24 March for a bail application. SOURCE: NEWS24
