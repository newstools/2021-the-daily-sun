MUSICIAN Busiswa Gqulu has scored a reality show, titled Her Majesty: Busiswa. The much-anticipated show is set to premiere on BET Africa. According to the channel, the 13-part show will serve as a visual companion to Busiswa’s musical journey. This is an ode to her lasting power and a celebration of her authenticity while capturing her journey in creating a visual album. Cameras will closely follow her as she opens her life to viewers across the continent. She will dive deeper into her award-winning music career, collaborations with international superstars, expanding her brand globally, intimate insights into family life and her new album. Speaking to Daily Sun, Busiswa said she was excited to partner with BET Africa. “BET continuously celebrates black culture and excellence globally. I look forward to sharing my truth whereas over the years, I have been reluctant to share anything,” she said. “But I have learnt that it’s more important to own my story. I’m willing to let my fans into the next level that is my private and spiritual life.” ALSO READ | SHAUWN MKHIZE JOINS UZALO Senior vice president and general manager at ViacomCBS Networks Africa Monde Twala told the People’s Paper: “It’s so inspiring to bring another local black female-led reality TV series to the channel.
