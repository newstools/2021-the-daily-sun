SOUTH African Under-23s coach David Notoane has beefed up his technical team by roping in Zipho Dlangalala as his assistant coach. Dlangalala has replaced Kwanele Kopo, who is now the assistant to Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki. The former Mamelodi Sundowns development and University of Pretoria coach is part of the Notoane’s squad that is going through an intense training camp in Durban. This is part of their preparations for the Olympics Games scheduled for Tokyo, Japan from 23 July to 8 August. Dlangalala was a free agent after leaving TS Galaxy recently and he’s reuniting with Notoane whom he worked with at the Sundowns development structures. “You know Kwanele Kopo is now helping Bafana Bafana so we needed someone here,” said Notoane. “Dlangalala brings in a lot of experience and the understanding of South Africa players. “I think now I have a fantastic technical team because I have Wendell Robinson (Sundowns goalkeeper coach), Lucky Shiburi who is with Polokwane City (and former Pirates MultiChoice Diski Challenge fitness coach). We have two technical members for every department.” Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Notoane added that it was important to have someone like Dlangalala, who has also coached Royal Eagles if the worst happens and he catches the virus when the Games start in July. “Covid is here, you never know because if I fall sick (he will have to take over),” said Notoane. Meanwhile, Fifa will host the draw for the Olympics at their Zurich headquarters on 21 April.
