FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s contempt of court matter is expected to be heard in the Constitutional Court on Thursday, 25 March. The Zondo Commission wants the court to declare that Zuma is guilty of the crime. The urgent application for an order came after Zuma failed to comply with the order handed down by the same court on 28 January 2021, directing him to appear before the commission. Justice Chris Jafta said: “Mr Zuma is obliged to comply with all lawfully issued summonses and directives of the commission and to appear and give evidence before the commission on dates determined by it. “Mr Zuma does not have a right to remain silent in the proceedings before the commission, and Mr Zuma is entitled to all privileges under section 3(4) of the Commissions Act, including the privilege against self-incrimination.” On 1 February, Zuma issued a statement accusing the court’s decision to order him to appear before Zondo of “effectively stripping me of my constitutional right as a citizen”. In its application last month, the commission asked that Zuma be jailed for two years in prison for the crime. In the court papers, commission secretary Itumeleng Mosala said this was “no ordinary case of contempt”. The police minister and the national police commissioner were cited as second and third respondents, respectively.
