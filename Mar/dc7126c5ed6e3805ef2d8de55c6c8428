FORMER Kaizer Chiefs flop Gustavo Paez has returned home to Venezuela. Paez has joined Yaracuyanos FC after his move to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) was cut short before it even began after he was signed by the club at the beginning of last season. The 30-year-old tried to come back to South Africa and was linked with a move to Maritzburg United in the January transfer window. But nothing came of that move. At Yaracuyanos, Paez has reunited with someone who is familiar to South African football in Antonio Flores. Flores coached the Super Eagles FC in the GladAfrica Championship from November 2017 until he was fired in March 2018. Flores is now Yaracuyanos’ technical director. “Our past football in South Africa now sees us back together in the South American continent in the Premier League of Venezuela,” said Flores. Paez has signed a short-term deal because he is still eager to come back to South Africa and play in the DStv Premiership. “He has only signed until the end of the season because he wants to return to South Africa,” revealed Flores. Paez arrived in Mzansi to join Chiefs in the second half of the 2016-17 season under Steve Komphela. Chiefs were looking for someone to score goals. But in his two-and-a-half season with Chiefs, he scored 10 goals. He was released at the end of the 2018-19 season after Chiefs were doing a clear out of players following their humiliating loss to Championship side TS Galaxy in the Ke Yona Cup final.
