AS far as succession plans go, the appointment of
Tlhopane Motsepe at Mamelodi Sundowns is the boldest move. The eldest of Patrice Motsepe’s sons has become the youngest
club boss in the PSL history, leading a Premiership club. But Tlhopi, as he is affectionately known, is not the
only one on the list of young club bosses.  Motsepe, however, will be assisted by his club board member Rejoice Simelane.    At 19, Andile Mpisane became the youngest club boss in
PSL history when he was announced as chairman of GladAfrica Championship outfit
Royal AM FC earlier this season. Mpisane, the son of Durban businesswoman and reality
television star Shauwn Mkhize, is an active player, having debuted for Royal in
their league fixture against Uthongathi last month. He has been described as an “intelligent and a very good
player”.     Junior Khanye is known for his wayward behaviour during his playing days. But the ex-Kaizer Chiefs midfielder is as serious as they come when it comes to football business.  Khanye recently announced that he will be registering his club, Fak’imali Uzobona FC, with the Local Football Association in Daveyton and will be competing in the lower Safa football division.    Denzel Ontong became the youngest club boss when he took
over ownership of fourth tier division side Powerlines FC back in 2011.  The Northern Cape side shot to notoriety when they were annihilated
24-0 by Mamelodi Sundowns in the Nedbank Cup.
