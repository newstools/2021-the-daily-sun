I THINK it’s safe to conclude that men and women are different creatures when it comes to laws of attraction. For men, it’s all about sight and what we see. Men devour with their eyes before any of their other senses. With their women counterparts, like the old Knorrox advertisement, it is all about the smell. According to relationship experts, women are more drawn to men who smell good. According to a group of researchers in Europe, a man sees, but a woman smells. The research study, published in the Personality and Individual Differences journal, showed that men were visual while women rated olfactory (smell) cues as more important in mate choice. The study proved that women valued olfactory cues significantly more than men, even in the non-sexual contexts. The same study further revealed that women, during sexual arousal and activity, were driven by touch and body smell. According to Social Issues Research Centre, women are indeed highly sensitive to male pheromones, especially around ovulation. So if you want to create a good impression with a woman, make sure you smell good!
