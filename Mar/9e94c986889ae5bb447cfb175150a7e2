THOUSANDS of gatvol residents marched to their local cop shop on Friday, 26 February to demand protection from the police. But the protesters in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, were told off by station commander Brigadier Kenny Nkwashu, who claimed the kasi people were bribing his officers. He said the station had good and bad cops, but residents were not helping the situation. “We have corrupt police officers but you, community members, are the corrupters because you are the ones who give them money when you see them taking bribes and don’t report them,” he said. CHIKEN KILLS OWNER! The march came after an article Daily Sun published on Monday 22 February about a family that was held hostage by a gang. Residents said a gang that travelled in a Quantum had been harassing them for months. They said they reported robberies by the gang, but police made no arrests. Resident Solomon Ndou said they were tired of being held hostage by thugs. He said they no longer felt safe in their homes. “We are in a crisis that needs urgent intervention,” he said. Addressing the residents, Nkwashu said he was grateful they had brought their concerns to him. He said he shared their worries. “I need healthy co-operation with you as a community. Only you can make our work successful.” Nkwashu said he was going to sit down and look at residents’ complaints and concerns and he would respond within the time frame he was given. He urged residents to help him remove corrupt officers at the station.
