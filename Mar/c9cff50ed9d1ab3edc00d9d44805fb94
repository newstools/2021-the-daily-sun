THE NPA in North West has suspended provincial Special Commercial Crimes Unit head, Jeanette Neveling, after she was arrested for shoplifting. Regional NPA spokesman Henry Mamothame said the authority decided to suspend the 53-year-old because it would be difficult for her to focus on her work while facing a criminal charges. “She has since been suspended by the NPA pending internal disciplinary proceedings,” he said. Neveling was also the deputy-director of senior prosecutors in the province and dealt with high profile cases, including that of former finance MEC Wendy Nelson. On Thursday 4 March, she made her first appearance in the Mmabatho Magistrates Court. The case was postponed to find a prosecutor from outside her jurisdiction. Neveling was arrested on 16 February for allegedly shoplifting at Woolworths at The Crossing Shopping Mall in Mahikeng. Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgoabone said she allegedly stole clothing and groceries. Her case was postponed to 1 June and her R500 bail was extended until her next court appearance.
