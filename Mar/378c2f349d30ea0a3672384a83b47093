RADIO sports presenter Spha Mavuso’s leaving Ukhozi FM, but hasn’t planned his next move yet. Mavuso, who has been with the station for 10 years, resigned last month and is due to leave at the end of this month. He said he had three job offers to choose from and wasn’t sure if he’d join another big broadcaster, take a job with a PSL team or go into business. Spha, originally from Ladysmith in KZN, told Daily Sun he’d go home to ask his mum to help him choose. “My resignation has nothing to do with current retrenchments at the SABC. I planned it a long time ago as I wanted to grow,” he said. “I don’t have bad blood with Ukhozi FM or the SABC, but this is the time to grow and make a legacy for my son. One day, I will be back with the SABC.” ALSO READ: BREAKING: KHUNE'S SISTER BURNT BEYOND RECOGNITION The father of one said it was a difficult decision to make. “To be honest, leaving is hurting me and it’s a difficult time for me but I have to grow. This is like giving away my child for adoption because radio presenting is my life.” Spha said he was considering starting a farming business or focusing more on his media promotion companies. “I’ve been running my company Us by Is Media Promotions since 2013. I’ve worked with top musicians like Intaba Yase Dubai and Sun El Musician,” he said. “We’re preparing to release a documentary on legendary Ukhozi FM DJ and sport presenter Mazweni ‘Joe’ Hudla soon,” he said. Spha said he had also co-owned a company called Drakensberg Music Promotion since 2009. “I have a big amount of land at home to work, but I will sit down with my mother and find a way forward with her. I am where I am because of my mother. She always gives me good advice,” he said.
