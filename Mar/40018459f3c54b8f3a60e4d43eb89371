KAIZER Chiefs have parted ways with one of the clubs' major sponsor. Amakhosi released a statement on Friday confirming that a 19-year-old relationship with the sponsor have came to an end. "After a 19-year partnership, Hollard and Kaizer Chiefs agreed that the relationship has run its course and did not renew the contract at the end of 2019/20 season," said the statement release on Chiefs website. "The partnership, which began with the creation of an insurance joint venture in 2001, was further developed with the signing of a sponsorship agreement in 2010." Chiefs Marketing Director Jessica Motaung assured Amakhosi fans who hold Hollard co-branded insurance policies that that their policies will remain intact even after the relationship has ended. Motaung said: "It has been a very interesting journey which has helped shape and evolve our Club, our retail approach and our thinking about insurance and delivering a one-stop-shop to our supporters that gives them peace of mind knowing that their family needs have been looked after when they are no longer there. We are glad that our supporters’ policies will remain intact even after the relationship has ended.”  Heidi Brauer, Chief Marketing Officer at Hollard said: "Over the years, we have certainly enabled more people to create and secure a better future. "And we will continue to do so for all Kaizer Chiefs supporters who already hold Hollard co-branded insurance policies, despite our partnership coming to an end. We also want to reassure customers that while our co-branded stores have closed down, our call centre and Hollard branches remain open for any queries."
