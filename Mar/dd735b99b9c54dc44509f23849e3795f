PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has described the police’s response to the Wits student protest, which led to the death of a passerby, as unwarranted and unfortunate. Responding to the debate on his speech from more than a week ago while opening the National House of Traditional Leaders, he conveyed his condolences to Mthokozisi Ntumba’s family. He was speaking on Thursday afternoon. The president said it appeared the students were protesting peacefully and that police overreacted, leading to the death of an innocent life. This had disturbed him deeply. The matter was being investigated by relevant bodies. The president’s comments on the behaviour of police echoed that of Police Minister Bheki Cele, who earlier told reporters it was becoming difficult to defend the reckless actions of the police. On the students’ demands, Ramaphosa said the matter was being discussed by Cabinet and a process to address it had begun. “We won’t abandon our students. They have a right to education and our government and, as much as we’re faced with enormous difficulties and challenges, we’ll continue to find solutions,” he said.
