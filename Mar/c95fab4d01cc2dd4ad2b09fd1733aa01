A NEIGHBOUR intervened after a girl’s cries for help almost roused the entire village! The 16-year-old was being sjamboked on Friday, allegedly by her mum, at their home in Vryheid in northern KZN. It’s alleged the mum, accusing the daughter of being disobedient, sjamboked her from about 4am to 7am! Apparently, the mother had asked her daughter not to go to school on Thursday, 4 March but the daughter went anyway. The annoyed 36-year-old mum of five allegedly woke her daughter up at about 4am, tied her up and beat her. The neighbour told Daily Sun she contacted the police when she heard the girl crying. “She beat her until the girl collapsed. I heard the girl’s siblings crying, thinking their sister had died.” She alleged the woman always beat her children. “But this time it was extreme. She beat her so hard I thought she’d killed her. She’s in hospital, in a critical condition,’’ she said. “The sad part is that even the grandmother was there. She didn’t stop her daughter.” KZN Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza paid a visit to Vryheid Hospital, where the girl is receiving medical assistance. Khoza said: “We need more people like that neighbour, who won’t allow children to be abused right under their noses. “We shouldn’t fold our arms when we see children being abused in our communities. “Anyone who abuses a child should face the full might of the law. No single person involved in the abuse of children should escape the law.” Khoza said a team of social workers were sent to the home to check on the children. Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a case of assault was being investigated by Ngome police. “She sustained injuries all over her body. A 36-year-old suspect was arrested,” said Gwala.
