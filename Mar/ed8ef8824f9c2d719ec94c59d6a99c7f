had been shot by a live round by the police when they were dispersing the
protesting students. Throughout the day, the police used
minimum force to deal with the students, but as the sun went down, tear gas was
used and some shots were fired. Some students were arrested as the police

Hillbrow police station and called for the release of the arrested students. National Police spokesman, Vishnu Naidoo
responded to the incident involving the wounded student. In a statement, he said, “The SAPS can
report that none of its members deployed in Braamfontein had fired any shots
during the said protests. However, to disperse volatile crowds, only a smoke
grenade was used in one incident and water cannons in others.” “This matter has not been officially
reported to the SAPS making it difficult to ascertain the nature of the
student's injuries as well as the circumstances under which the injuries were
sustained.” “Police are looking forward to
interviewing the student as well as obtaining the medical report regarding this
matter.”
