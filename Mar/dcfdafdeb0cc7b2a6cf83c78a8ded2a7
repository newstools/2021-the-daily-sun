A RUNAWAY van on fire almost killed a man. Dashcam footage of the van has surfaced on social media and it has shocked many people. In the video published by 5New, a cop was responding to the fire from a van parked on a steep driveway in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The moment the cop parks his car, the handbrake of the burning van gives way and it starts to roll down the driveway. The officer can be heard shouting “Hey, watch out!” to a man watching from the street. It’s the type of scene you would expect to see in a Hollywood film, not in real life. Fire crews arrived shortly after the dramatic scenes and managed to extinguish the fire.
