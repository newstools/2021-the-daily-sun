The shooting and killing of the innocent man on his way from a clinic, during the protest by Wits University students, is regrettable. The man happened to be there while trying to attend to his health. It’s sad that he was caught in the crossfire. It’s about time that we saved lives by re-training our police on how to deal with tense situations. Many lives have been lost as a result of police brutality, and all we do is blame the men in blue. We need to get to the bottom of this for the sake of our country. The students may have been unruly at times but were unarmed. Why use live ammunition to control such a situation? A passerby has died, for God’s sake What do you say to his family? How do you feel, Bheki Cele? Do you say, “Sorry. It’s was a mistake?” One loss of life is one too many. I’d also want to blame the authorities. It looks bad that students have to toyi-toyi every year to get what they want. Recover all the money stolen by thug politicians and channel it towards education. Acornhoek
