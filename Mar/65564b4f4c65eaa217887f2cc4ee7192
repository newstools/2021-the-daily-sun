A CAMPAIGN that started on a high and raised hopes of a return to the top flight is spectacularly degenerating into a crisis at GladAfrica Championship club Jomo Cosmos. Cosmos are not only winless in their last six matches, they are the only professional side in Mzansi not to have won at home this season as the Championship heads into the second half of the campaign. They have five draws from their nine home games played to date. The best Jomo Sono’s side managed during this disastrous six matches period (five league, one cup) was a dull, goalless home draw against JDR Stars. Ezenkosi have gone off the rails since 26 January. That is the last time they tasted victory (2-1) at Cape Town All Stars. At one stage they were joint leaders of the national first division, Sono’s men are now nearer to the relegation dogfight than to a title challenge. They have slipped to 11th in the 16-team table, with 20 points and sit eight points off the top of the table, a position occupied by Richards Bay. Results on the field depict a crisis, the technical team played down such talk.Sebapole said despite the ongoing struggles, the team remained confident of turning their fortunes around. – CAJ NEWS “Well, it’s football. We will bounce back,” said Sono’s assistant, Brian Sebapole. He said injuries had also contributed to the poor form in recent games and suspensions.
