BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has confirmed that midfielder Bongani Zungu will not join the rest of the squad for their final Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier against Sudan. Bafana, who were held to a 1-1 draw by Ghana in their penultimate Group C match on Thursday, will face Sudan at Al Hilal Stadium on Sunday without the Scotland based midfielder. This after the Rangers man was denied permission to travel to Sudan to join up with Bafana because he would have to travel through “Covid-19 hot spots” to get to Omdurman. Zungu, who could not travel to Mzansi for the match against Ghana due to the same regulations as the country has been placed on the “red list” by the United Kingdom, was expected to be available for the match against Sudan. But Ntseki has revealed that a letter from Rangers indicated that Zungu would no longer be making the trip. “The negotiations have been going on but on Wednesday we got a letter from Rangers stating that they won’t be releasing him,” said a disappointed Ntseki. “I spoke to him (Zungu) and he explained his situation. He believes it’s a decision that would work against him if he were to force to come to Sudan with the team. “Again, we saw a new list of countries that have been declared red zones. There's Dubai and Ethiopia on that list. Our players need to go through Ethiopia or Dubai to get to Sudan.”
