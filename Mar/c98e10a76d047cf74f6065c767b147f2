GHANA national team coach Charles Akonnor is a happy man! This is after his charges achieved what was their target in their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier match against South Africa.The two sides played to a 1-1 on Thursday evening at FNB Stadium. The draw was enough for Ghana to qualify for the finals in Cameroon. "We came here with the idea that if we could get a draw, we would be fine," Akonnor told media after the match. "We didn't need to lose and we were able to achieve that." Mohammed Kudus was the first player to find the back of the net, putting The Black Stars in the lead just after half-time. However, their lead was short-lived as Bafana were able to find an equaliser in the 51 minutes through Percy Tau. Akonnor added: "Going into the game, we knew what was expected of us. We knew the strength of the South Africans, how they would play and attack, so we were well prepared to play without the ball. Team organisation was key for us. "In the early minutes of the game, we struggled because we realised they came with a three-back, and they put much pressure on us. "We weren't ready for that. Slowly, we had to do a tactical change in the process of the game. We managed to go in the first half but intended the second half, we discussed a lot how we should approach the game and we were doing very well in that sense." Bafana will not travel to Omdurman, Sudan where they will need to get a point book their spot in the finals.
