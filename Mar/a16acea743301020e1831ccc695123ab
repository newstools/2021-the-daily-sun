THEY were preparing to sleep when the electricity came back after load shedding. Their four-roomed shack went up in flames. And Kgomotso Magongwa (38) from Chris Hani in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, lost everything. “The fire started in the room where the transformer was. I heard a huge bang and when I checked, my transformer was burning,” she said. Kgomotso and her kids ran outside and tried to put out the fire with sand and water, but the flames were too strong.  She said she blamed Eskom for the load shedding that burnt down her shack. Gauteng Eskom spokeswoman Reneiloe Semenya said customers with matters of this nature should formally log a complaint. She said she’d forward Kgomotso’s details to customer service. “Eskom will then investigate, and a recommendation will be issued on the outcome of the case.”
