MTHOKOZISI Ntumba was remembered by Wits students on Friday, 12 March two days after he was shot and killed in Braamfontein, Joburg allegedly by police. They walked on De Beer Street where Ntumba’s body was collected by forensic pathologists. The street has been informally named after him as Ntumba Street by the students, who removed the De Beer name after Ntumba’s death. Speaking to Daily Sun, Sicelo Gazide of Wits EFF said: “The most important thing about this walk is that we want to honour a life that we have lost.” He said it was sad that Ntumba found himself in the mix of students raising concerns with the university and the clash with cops. “He was one of us as a black person and he deserves all the respect that we can give him. Yesterday we had a candlelight vigil.” He added: “We are already drafting a memorandum of demands, this is the most important to say they must change the name of the street to Ntumba street. “It is part of our decolonisation project because when I walk on this street, I don’t know who De Beer is, but I know who Ntumba was because we were together. "We have started with the formality, writing to the City of Joburg that we want this street name to be changed and we have acted and started by changing it ourselves.”
