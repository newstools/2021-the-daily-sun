STATUES are once again in the spotlight as students who are protesting for free education are also calling the statues to fall. On Friday Wits students continued with their protest, which started early this week. They set the statue that is outside the Joburg Council chambers alight and wanted to bring it down as it one of the colonial symbols. They said the statue, which shows men working with mining tool, show that black people came to Joburg for nothing else but work. Wits SRC President Mpedulo Mfeka said, “Today we were here, to remove a statue that was put in Braamfontein to remind people that they’ve alone come to Gauteng to work hard labour, this is the statue that is a constant reminder that our people come here to work and nothing else.” “When we say we want free and decolonized education, we want the decolonization of the city. On Thursday, Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande assured the students that NSFAS would come to the party and make money available for students. “We are not satisfied because the same problem is going to be next year.” Mfeka said free education and decolonised education are what they need for the protest to stop. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WitsProtests?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WitsProtests</a> | JMPD on the scene.
