GIVEN Sinkala says the Covid-19 shutdown pushed him to start doing pottery. The 50-year-old from Mamelodi Gardens, Tshwane, told Daily Sun he wasn’t making enough from his fashion design business, so he decided to branch out. He said he soon began making such beautiful pots that people were convinced he was buying them from someone else. Given, who was born in Zambia, said he started designing clothes in 1993 but only got into pottery in December. “I use clothes, tiles, newspapers, boxes, wire and cement to make the pots.” Given called his new business African Burning Bush Flower Pots. “My pots can withstand any weather and can be painted in any colour or with any pattern.” He said being out in the rain only made his pots stronger. “I feel excited because this is a viable business and making these pots doesn’t cost me a lot. My customers are encouraging me and my family to stay focused on this business.” Given said he was willing to work hard and also wanted to teach young people his skills. “There’s nothing more beautiful than showcasing your own work.” He said people in his kasi bought his pots but he also planned to sell them in Brooklyn and Menlyn. Given said he just had a natural talent and never had any formal training to make pots. His items sold for between R100 and R500. Customer Mavis Nkuna (65) said Given is very talented and his pots looked wonderful in her house. “He loves his work.”
