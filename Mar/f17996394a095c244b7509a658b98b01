FORMER Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach Joel Masutha admitted that he misses being involved in football, again. Masutha parted ways with Tshakhuma last month after new owner Abraham Sello bought the Venda-based side from Masala Mulaudzi and brought in former Baroka and Black Leopards coach, Dylan Kerr as their new mentor. Masutha told SunSport yesterday that he is at home in Manini near Thohoyandou in Venda, spending time with his family. “I love football and coaching is something I enjoy doing,” said Masutha. “My life is about football and all I am doing now is watching games on television. I am with my family but sometimes you miss your job. I am bored. I keep myself busy by reading books when the kids are at school and my wife is at work.” But Masutha said he is confident he will get a team soon. Masutha made name for himself when he guided Lidoda Duvha back to the top flight two season ago. Since then, the former Leopards goalkeeper has coached Chippa United and Royal Kings. “I have learnt a lot since I have been coaching in the top flight and GladAfrica Championship,” explained Masutha. “It has been a dream for me to coach in the top flight and I think I have grown up as a young coach and I am ready to lead any team now. It is not easy to coach in the Premiership, but you have to be up for the challenge. I can’t wait to get back to coaching.” Meanwhile, former Polokwane City assistant coach Bernard Molekwa also told SunSport that he is ready to coach again. Molekwa left Rise and Shine at the end of last season. “I took a break just to spend time with my family,” Molekwa stated. “You know in football it is difficult to be with your family and I felt I needed time off from football. But now I feel like I am ready to go back.” Molekwa had been with City for seven years. City are now playing in the Championship after they were relegated last season.
