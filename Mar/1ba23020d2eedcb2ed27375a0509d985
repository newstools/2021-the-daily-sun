KAIZER Chiefs young left winger, Happy Mashiane, says playing regularly this season with so much expectations has not been easy, but he’s grateful to the technical team. Chiefs, under coach Gavin Hunt, have looked to their development to add to their squad, as they couldn’t sign players in the last two transfer markets because they were serving a Fifa transfer ban. This has seen players like Mashiane, Darrell Matsheke and Nkosingiphile Ngcobo playing regularly in the league and also in the Caf Champions League. Of the 31 games Chiefs have played in all competitions so far, Mashiane, though held back by an injury earlier in the season, has featured in 10 league games – two in the MTN8, one in the Nedbank Cup and two in the Champions League – and has scored three goals. “I can’t say Ngcobo and myself are Chiefs main players, but this is a team effort,” said Mashiane. “All I can say since the coach arrived and others from the development like coach Arthur Zwane (Hunt’s assistant coach), are guiding me. “But coach Hunt has instilled a belief that we have to be hungry for us to succeed. Because things don’t come easy, you have to work hard.” Like Ngcobo, Mashiane says Chiefs are out of the running to win the DStv Premiership and must focus on the Champions League. Chiefs are ninth on the Premiership table with 23 points from 19 matches and trail the unbeaten log leaders Sundowns by 17 points. The Tshwane giants still have a game in hand over Chiefs. Mashiane added to what Ngcobo said last week that they plan on going the full distance in the Champions League. Chiefs are third in Group C with five points, level with second placed Horoya. Both teams trail Moroccan giants Wydad Athletic Club. Amakhosi host Wydad on Saturday at FNB Stadium. “We have to work hard in order to get something because it has been a while since we won anything, and this is the first time the team is in the Champions League group stages,” said Mashiane.
