The Office of the Public Protector has confirmed that Public
Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has opened a case against the Minister of
Transport Fikile Mbalula on Monday. The Public Protector spokesman Oupa Segwale
said Mkhwebane has opened a case of crimen injuria and contempt. This came after Mbalula twitted that Mkhwebane is just a
hired gun not a public protector.   Segwale said Mbalula and other ministers who have made
contemptuous remarks about the public protector were previously reported to the
president. He said the request was for the president, in his capacity
as head of the executive, to rein them in. "It’s not clear if anything ever came of the request,”
he said. Segwale said Mbalula is not just any other person but a
member of the executive. The war between the public Protector and the Minister came
after the ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule called on his party's MPs to
oppose the process to vote against public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, which
is due to start next week.
