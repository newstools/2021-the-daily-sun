ARTISTS have accused 10 radio personalities at Metro FM and Ukhozi FM of demanding payola. The names included the SABC general manager, Metro FM’s programmes manager and station manager and Ukhozi FM compilers and a presenter. Their names were written on placards during a protest to the SABC’s offices in Auckland Park, Joburg, on Wednesday, 10 March. In their memorandum of demands, the artists accused head of radio Nada Wotshela of having no interest in resolving the matter. They demanded her removal. The artists called for everyone implicated in payola to be removed and selection committees to be dismantled. They said the issue needed to be immediately investigated. Mzwakhe Mbuli, an artist and one of the march organisers, told Daily Sun they submitted 10 names to the Hawks and the SABC for investigation.

However, he said he was happy that the broadcaster had acknowledged payola was an issue. “We managed to sit down with them and they acknowledged this. “For us, this is a victory but we want culprits to be investigated and removed.” On Wednesday, Wotshela was quoted as saying: “We are longing for the day when an artist comes to us and says they were asked to pay an amount and proof of payment. We can’t just fire a person without evidence.” The SABC said: “We would like encourage artists to come forward with evidence of payola practices to ensure that action is taken against those involved. “Furthermore, the SABC has not been contacted by the Hawks, but will gladly cooperate.” The Hawks failed to respond to media queries.
