Wabantu recently posted a picture announcing that she had bought herself a
Lamborghini. She was
then allegedly targeted by SARS, then ditched the plans of buying the exotic
car. Well, one
man who managed to flaunt his pocket is businessman Hamilton Ndlovu. This after
he bought several cars, including a Porsche 992 Carrera, Porsche Panamera GTS,
Jeep Cherokee, and Lamborghini Urus all at once. After flaunting his luxury
cars on a video on social media, he landed on the radar of the South African
Revenue Services (SARS). SARS then
obtained a provisional preservation order against him and five companies
associated with him. SARS went to the High Court to confirm the order.    The court said Ndlovu was solely responsible for SARS taking an interest in his affairs and that of the respondents. “He thrust himself out of the obscurity by doing two things. First, in May 2020, he bought five luxury vehicles at about the same time. The collective value of the cars is said to be about R10,5m.” Acting Deputy Judge-president of the Gauteng Division Roland Sutherland said Ndlovu’s reasons for challenging the provisional order were not sufficient. The judge said Ndlovu spared SARS the burden of reading any tax returns since 2016. “They referred the big spender to the illicit economy unit, that took a keen interest in mismatched income and expenditure phenomena.” The court then ruled that the provisional order be confirmed and made final, and freeze Ndlovu’s assets. SARS hit the tycoon with a R36 million bill. The SunTeam was unable to get hold of Ndlovu for comment.
