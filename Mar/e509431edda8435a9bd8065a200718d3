FORMER Lily Mine workers have called on the Mpumalanga High Court to fast track the court case between potential investors, business rescue practitioners and the mine owner. They marched to the court to hand over a memorandum of grievances yesterday. They called on the court to allow business rescue practitioners to execute the already-approved business rescue plan without any further delays. This after the practitioners and Vantage Goldfields were taken to court by potential investor, Arqomanzi, after they changed the initial business rescue plan without consulting Arqomanzi, which is also the biggest creditor. Last month, Justice Greyling-Coetzer issued an interim order preventing the practitioners from acting unlawfully. He stated that any other interested persons had until 4 May to show cause at their own cost on why the order should not be made final, failing which the interim order would be finalised.  One of the former employees, Petros Maseko, told Daily Sun the workers were frustrated to hear that the court stopped the business rescue practitioners from paying them the money they were supposed to get early this month. “We want them to put aside the court matter and fast track our case,” he said. Leader of the former workers, Vuyo Mdunyelwa, said they wanted the mine reopened and outstanding salaries paid out and workers back at work. “We have lost a lot of employees to depression. Most families are suffering and we are also suffering. The court must help us.” Mdunyelwa said they would take further steps if their demands were not met. Koaneng Maseko, the registrar of the high court, received the memorandum.
