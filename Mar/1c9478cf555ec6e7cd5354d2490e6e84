  Mpumalanga Police are continuing to clamp down on suspects
who are vandalizing essential infrastructure in the mines and Eskom, which has
left the surrounding community without electricity. This came after police continued to conduct a sting
operation between Monday, 01 and Thursday, 04 March 2021, at which 79 suspects
were arrested for Contravention of Critical Infrastructure Protection Act and
other related cases. According to Mpumalanga Police Spokesperson Brigadier
Leonard Hlathi said police issued a warning last month, where 114 suspects were
arrested on various charges, including trespassing, possession of suspected
stolen property, contravention of the Disaster Management Regulations by
failing to confine to their places of residence, as well as contravention of
the Illegal Immigration Act, as in the main, these suspects are Zimbabwean as
well as Mozambican Nationals. However, these suspects continue with their illegal
activities wreaking havoc. “Police are also relentless in their efforts to bring the
suspects' illegal activities to an end. At times the suspects are acting
dangerously as several police and mine vehicles have been shot. One police
officer was robbed of her firearm.” “The suspects aged between 18 and 61, are alleged to have
illegally entered Goedhoop mine premises in Blinkpan near Middelburg, stole
items and further vandalised the mine's infrastructure. Police confiscated 20
cars during the arrest of the suspects, and they have already appeared before
the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court where they were granted R1000 bail each.” “This brings now a total of over 80 cars that were seized by
police so far and want to warn them that such lawlessness will not be tolerated
and operations around these affected areas will continue to be intensified,” said
