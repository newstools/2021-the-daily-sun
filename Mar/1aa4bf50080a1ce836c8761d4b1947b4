THE parents of kids at Gobhogobho Primary School in Ntuzuma, north of Durban, are upset because since Monday pupils have been told to all come to school at the same time. This is after parents, worried that it will be hard for their kids to practise social distancing, were assured by the Department of Education their children will adhere to Covid-19 regulations. Most schools have divided pupils into groups so that the regulations are met. A parent told Daily Sun that when the schools opened, pupils never shared desks so that social distancing was maintained. “Now two pupils sit together in one desk. There’s no social distancing and windows can’t be opened either,” said the parent. Another parent said they couldn’t understand why the school had stopped dividing the pupils into groups. “We fear our children will get sick. We may be in lockdown level one but that doesn’t mean Covid-19 is no longer here,” said the parent. “We are unhappy but we can’t even go to the school to complain because they don’t listen to us.” The parent said they wanted the education department to intervene. “We suspect the department is not aware of this as this is not happening in other schools. “We asked some of the teachers and they too are confused just like us,” said the parent. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said: “We will send our district officials to visit the school.”
