YOU don’t see this every day – a driver spinning a Ferrari 458 Italia that costs about R4 million at a petrol station. A video of a red Ferrari doing doughnuts at a petrol station has surfaced on social media. In the video, the exotic car can be seen going sideways. People in the background can be heard cheering on the driver as he sends the car into a tailspin. #VrrphaaTuesday you don't see that everyday???? absolutely mental @gmancarreviews pic.twitter.com/AWG3fj0aws
