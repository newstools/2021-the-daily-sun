KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has confirmed that veteran goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has joined the Bafana Bafana camp. Khune was excused from Chiefs’ camp on compassionate leave for over a week following the sad passing of his sister. They were question marks whether Khune will form part of the Bafana’s squad for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Ghana at FNB Stadium on 25 March and three days later against Sudan in Khartoum. However, as he was following the Covid-19 regulations having been away from Chiefs squad, Khune was back in the stands as Chiefs beat their rivals 1-0 in a DStv Premiership at FNB Stadium on Sunday. “He seemed to be in good spirit and he went away to the national team camp,” said Hunt. “He trained with us the last two or three days and before the game to do a little bit. I’m happy he’ll have a full week of training with Bafana. If he gets to play, I don’t know.“We got a friendly this week and I would have liked him to play but he’s not going to be here, but it is okay.” On top of losing his sister, it has been a difficult period for Khune this season. He has been at fault a couple of times in some games for Chiefs. He also lost the captain armband which went to Ramahlwe Mphahlele. “It has been stressing time for him and I mean I don’t have to say it,” revealed Hunt. “What he has been through, I don’t want to talk about it. The club is here to help him tremendously, that’s all I can say.” Khune has also lost the national team number one jersey to SuperSport United captain Ronwen Williams. The 91 capped Bafana player who last played for Bafana was against Nigeria in the Afcon qualifiers at FNB Stadium in November 2018. However, he ended the 12 games being on the side-lines as he was on the bench when Bafana beat Sao Tome in both matches last year November in Mzansi.
