AWARD-WINNING comedian Trevor Noah continues to fly the Mzansi flag high. The brilliant stand-up comedian has been named Outstanding Host at the annual National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Awards in the talk/information category. His international hit show, The Daily Show, won Outstanding Short Form Series for Between the Scenes. This is the fourth award the media personality has won at the prestigious award ceremony. Previously, in 2017, Trevor was a winner in the Literary Work – Debut Author category, Literary Work – Biography/Auto Biography category, and in the Best Writing in a Comedy Series in 2019. The funny man, who recently hosted the Grammy Awards, took to his Instagram account and thanked the awards for the recognition. “I’m surrounded by such an incredible team. Thank you, NAACP Image Awards, for shining a light on them! Big congrats to The Daily Show on two award wins,” he wrote. Trevor was also nominated in the Entertainer of The Year category alongside Viola Davis, Regina King and D-Nice. The event honours outstanding performances in film, TV, music and literature. This is not the only international award the star has won. In 2017, he won his first ever Emmy award for the Best Short Form Variety Series, in which he provided web-exclusive commentary for political events in America and around the world.
