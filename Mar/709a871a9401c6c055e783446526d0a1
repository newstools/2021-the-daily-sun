DSTV Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns are the biggest suppliers of players to a number of national teams during the current Fifa international break. The Premiership leaders have 12 players called up for various national teams, including three in the South African Under-23 camp that is taking place in Durban. Mosa Lebusa, Themba Zwane, Andile Jali, Rivaldo Coetzee, Thapelo Morena and othobi Mvala were called up by Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki for two crucial Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan. Sundowns striker Kermit Erasmus was originally called up but ruled out because of injury and replaced on Monday by teammate Mvala. Ghana are on top of Group C due to the head-to-head rule after beating Bafana in the opening qualifier 2-0 in November 2019 and then playing to a 1-1 draw on Thursday. Also out in Sundowns camp is goalkeeper Ricardo Goss, Keletso Makgalwa and Grant Magerman. The threesome is in the national team SA under-23 camp in Durban. This is part of coach David Notoaneâ€™s preparations for the Olympics Games scheduled for Tokyo, Japan from 23 July to 8 August 2021.
