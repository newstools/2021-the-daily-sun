ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has lashed out at his players for lack of communication which led to a 1-0 defeat against fierce rivals Kaizer Chiefs in the DStv Premiership match at FNB Stadium on Sunday. The German-born mentor could not believe it that his defence was caught ball watching to give Chiefs lethal striker Samir Nurkovic the chance to score an important goal via an overhead kick. “They (his players) made it too easy, but the goal scored by Nurkovic was a top goal,” Said Zinnbauer. “But we should have easily defended it and maybe it was the communication problem, I don’t know. Probably Tyson (Thulani Hlatshwayo) thought the other player was taking it (clearing to safety) and they got the goal.” However, Zinnbauer was not pleased with Chief's defensive tactics which made it difficult for his players to penetrate them. “Kaizer Chiefs stayed in a deep block and it is always not easy to find the solution quickly,” said Zinnabuer. “We can’t say Chiefs have no quality, they have quality players and giant guys at the back. They did it well (defended) and we didn’t find a solution, this was the problem. “I don’t know what Chiefs' plans were. But I was a little bit surprised by their low block since this was their home game. From our side, we didn’t have any luck to get a fourth win this season.”
