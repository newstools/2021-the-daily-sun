A FORMER Rural Development and Land Reform Minister is in hot water over a R1.1 billion land claim deal of Mala-Mala Private Game Reserve within Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga. EFF Commissar Sam Matiase and his regional chairperson Surprise Kubayi opened the case on Thursday. Matiase confirmed that the EFF has opened charges of corruption against a former minister, his former director general, the commissioner for restitution and land rights and their associates. The EFF leadership met the affected land claimants and supposed beneficiaries of the 2014 land claim deal. “The Mala-Mala Game Reserve land claim was valued at R750 million by its previous owners. However, the Land Claims Court rejected and refused that previous owners should be paid this amount on the basis that the price was far above the market value and the actual value of the land. Claimants lodged an appeal to the Constitutional Court.” One of the Mala-Mala Game Reserve land claimants and witnesses in the court, Spokes Sithole, said before court started, the former minister sought an out-of-court settlement and the department paid more than R1.1 billion. “Both the Land Claims Court and High Court ruled that the price of R750 million for Mala-Mala was too excessive,” said Sithole. However, Matiase said the deal went through nonetheless before the case reached the Constitutional Court and this needed to be investigated. “In 2018, the Rural Development and Land Reform portfolio committee resolved that a forensic investigation by the Special Investigative Unit should be initiated to prove the circumstances of the inflated prices including the allegations that some 900 households were supposed to benefit from the deal but in reality only 250 households.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “I can confirm that a case of corruption has been registered at Calcutta police station. But no one has been arrested so far. I am therefore not at liberty to divulge who this case was opened against.”
