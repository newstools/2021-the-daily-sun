THE mum of a cop who was killed last year says she’s happy his case is finally going to be heard. This comes after Lerato Makhoana was told by the cops handling the case that it would soon be transferred to the High Court for trial. Her son Thato (26) was killed in July before his body was dumped alongside a road outside Mahikeng, North West, and his car set alight. Ever since Thato’s death, a number of suspects have been arrested, only to be released. Lerato has attended eight different hearings at the Mmabatho Magistrates Court, only to be disappointed. She said she would be able to start healing once Thato got justice. “This is the first good news I’ve heard from the police since my son’s death. I want closure. I want those who killed my son to be punished for what they did,” she said. However, Lerato said a delay in paying out her son’s pension fund was disappointing. “I have not received a cent from my son’s employer for the hard work he did for the police service. I want to know what is taking them so long. They don’t want to explain it to me.” North West police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgoabone said Constable Makhoana’s last salary was paid out in July while his leave payment was paid in December. “The late member’s pension benefits file was processed and submitted to the Government Pensions Administration Agency on 18 December 2020 for further handling,” he said.
