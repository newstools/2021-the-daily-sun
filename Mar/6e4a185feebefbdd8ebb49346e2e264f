PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is pinning her hope on outstanding legal processes to clear her name after a panel report found she has a case of misconduct to answer to. Her spokesman Oupa Segalwe said she was studying the report and taking legal advice. “For now, no decision has been taken on whether she will take the report on review.” Segalwe said Mkhwebane only received the report on Monday when it was released to the public. The report paves the way for parliament to investigate her fitness to hold office. Mkhwebane unsuccessfully tried to take the matter to the high court. However, she has taken the matter to the Constitutional Court. Segalwe said Mkhwebane had not been given a date for the matter to be heard or told when papers could be filed. She’s arguing that rules allowing for parliament to remove heads of section 9 institutions in consultation with an illegal expert panel are unconstitutional and invalid. Mkhwebane said in a statement that it should be noted that processes were still unfolding. “The report is a pronouncement on the alleged existence of prima facie evidence against the Public Protector and not findings of wrongdoing. It should be noted that there are still court processes in relation to this matter. “The Public Protector is confident that both the parliamentary process and the judicial proceedings, which are before the high court and the Constitutional Court, will ultimately result in her being cleared of any alleged wrongdoing.” Mkhwebane said she wanted to assure the public that the recommendations of the panel and the parliamentary process had no direct bearing on the functioning of her office.
