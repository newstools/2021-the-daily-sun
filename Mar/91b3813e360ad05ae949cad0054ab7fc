IT IS not clear whether Port Elizabeth’s renaming to Gqeberha will be permanent. This after Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Nqaba Bhanga and residents opposed it. The renaming of PE and Uitenhage to Kariega caused an outcry among some residents, who called on the Geographical Names Committee to engage communities once more. Even various political parties complained about the processes followed. Bhanga said yesterday they believed processes followed by Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa were questionable. “I find it strange that the minister claimed Gqeberha is the Khoi name for Baakens River. If Gqeberha is Khoi, why not write it in Khoi?” he said. “Restoration of languages means those that were written incorrectly should be restored. “If they want Gqeberha, they must write it in Khoi. Writing it in Xhosa is wrong because it has no meaning.” Arts and Culture MEC Fezeka Nkomonye said people had 30 days to object. “Once the objection has been lodged, the minister will check if all procedures and processes were followed. “We’ve written to the Geographical Names Committee requesting documentation regarding process followed and minutes of meetings.”
