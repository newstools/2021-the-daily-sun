AFTER 100 years, the KZN Society for the Blind is closing down because it lacks funding. The sad news was revealed to Daily Sun by the centre’s financial officer, Lihle Mbambo, yesterday. She said the centre owed the eThekwini Municipality R800 000 for lights and water. According to Mbambo, the municipality warned that water and electricity would be cut if the bill wasn’t settled by the end of the month. She said the centre depended on donors, but many pulled out due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “It will be a sad day when we shut down at the end of the month. It seems unavoidable now. Only a miracle will save us. “We still hope a good Samaritan will come forward,” she said. Mbambo said that donors were not to be blamed because lockdown hit many companies hard. Kenneth Ngwenya, who is blind, said the closure would affect him and others badly as they were able to add to their disability grants with the income they earned making handwork at the centre. He said more than 200 blind people worked at the centre to help support their families. Mbambo said the Social Development Department only paid for social workers while the daily running costs came from donations. The centre was started in 1918 in Durban. To let signs have already been put up outside the building on Umbilo Road.
