Cape Town All Stars will square off with Pretoria Callies in the 2020/21 Nedbank Cup quarterfinal match at the Danie Craven Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 3:00 pm CAT. All Stars are coming into this clash in great form as they are undefeated in their last six competitive matches - recording one draw and five wins including a 2-1 victory over JDR Stars on March 6. Igugu Lekapa reached the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals for the first time in the club's history after defeating fellow GladAfrica Championship side Cape Town Spurs 5-3 on penalties after a 3-3 draw last month. Calvin Marlin, the All Stars head coach, says they are looking to reach the Nedbank Cup final and PSL promotional/relegation playoffs this season. “We are looking to keep improving on our log position, not looking too far ahead," Marlin said. "Hopefully by the end, we have achieved something; if it means we get to the playoffs, making it to the final of the cup or getting more players to PSL level.” Meanwhile, Callies will be keen to return to winning ways after their two-match unbeaten run came to an end when they lost 3-2 to Royal AM in their most recent game in the GladAfrica Championship. The Romans are also making their debut appearance in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals, having defeated their Championship rivals JDR Stars 5-4 on penalties after a 0-0 draw last month. Sammy Troughton, the Callies head coach, says they are taking the Nedbank Cup very seriously and he is targeting a victory in the Western Cape. “We want to keep the fans happy, the management happy and the players. So we are taking it very seriously. The players have been up for it at training, and we know it is not going to be an easy one," Troughton said. "But I'm happy that the venue is Danie Craven, which is a bit of a neutral place. I don't think they have played there. We are going to Cape Town to try and get the result.” -SuperSport
