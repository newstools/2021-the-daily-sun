ACTOR Vuyo Dabula will make his last appearance as Gadaffi on SABC1 soapie Generations: The Legacy on Wednesday, 17 March. Daily Sun previously reported he was booted after he was given an ultimatum to shoot the now cancelled Queen Sono season 2 and Generations: The Legacy. He chose to go with Queen Sono before it was canned. The star had been at the helm as Gadaffi on the show for over four years. Generations publicity manager Nandipha Pansti confirmed that the star would be making his final appearance, but wasn’t going to be killed off. “I can confirm Vuyo Dabula will be making his exit from the show tomorrow, 17 March,” she said. “He’s done well while on the show and has shown dedication throughout his stay with us. We wish him all the best in his future plans.” ALSO READ | MODERN TIMES HAVE CHANGED THINGS He’s not the only high-profile star leaving the show.
