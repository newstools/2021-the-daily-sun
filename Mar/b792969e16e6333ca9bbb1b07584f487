REALITY TV star and dancer Zodwa Wabantu has finally started school. The talented media personality recently enrolled at Star Quality Performing Arts College as an acting and performing arts student. Zodwa told Daily Sun she enjoyed her first day. “My first day at school was a bag of mixed emotions. I was excited and nervous at the same time, but I really enjoyed myself,” she said. “Everyone was welcoming and friendly. It was better than I imagined it would be. “My first day was not hectic. We had a brief introduction to what we’d be doing throughout the course, and I can’t wait to see what they have in store for me because I’m ready for every challenge on the way.

I hope one day my story will inspire others.” Asked how she’d handle her busy schedule, Zodwa said: “Honestly, when you want something you make time for it. I will make sure I plan everything properly so I have time to attend classes and study. In life we have to make sacrifices to get what we want.” A post shared by zodwalibram (@zodwalibram)
