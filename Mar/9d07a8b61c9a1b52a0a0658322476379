CHAMPAGNE is on ice! All that Patrice Motsepe is waiting for is the election formalities on 12 March before he assumes the position of Caf president and pops the bottle. The businessman is set to become the eighth CAF president unopposed after the other three candidates, Augustin Senghor, Ahmed Yahya and Jacques Anouma, withdrew in a unanimous pre-arranged pact. The other candidates signed an agreement in Nouakchott in the presence of Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in which they will agree to give up their bids in exchange for the post of advisor and two vice-presidencies respectively. Infantino was captured in camera, along with in-coming president Motsepe, Yahya and Senghor on Saturday.
