THE Maringa family is tired of waiting to bury their loved one and wants closure. This after Eugene Maringa (47) burnt to death in a shack at Alaska in Mamelodi, Tshwane, in September. But the family is still awaiting DNA results from forensics. His mother, gogo Thandi (71), said she was losing hope that she would ever bury her son. “I suffer from arthritis and not burying my son is affecting my health. MASTURBATION CAN HELP YOUR MENTAL HEALTH! “When we call police, they tell us they will check. It’s been six months and my son’s body is still with the authorities. We just want to bury him so we can heal properly,” she said. Thandi said she spoke to Mamelodi East cops three weeks ago and was told the police were still checking. “Police are saying Covid-19 affected the process of forensic investigation. “I’m begging them to release my son. “We need closure because it is affecting the family,” she said. BABY MAMA: I WARNED HIM! Thandi told Daily Sun that she dreamt about her son coming home, but he was not saying anything. “My son’s death continues to torment my family. We need his body because we have waited too long,” she said. Mamelodi East Police Station spokesman Constable Lethabo Mashiloane said: “We are still waiting for a report from forensic services. “The victim identification centre took DNA samples and we are still awaiting confirmation from them.”
