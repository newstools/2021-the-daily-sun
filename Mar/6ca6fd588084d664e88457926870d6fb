UNIONS representing health workers have threatened a total shutdown of health facilities if a decision to cancel overtime for workers is not reversed. Limpopo health workers were left fuming after Thokozani Mhlongo, the head of the provincial department, announced on Monday that there would be no overtime after this month. A number of unions held a media briefing in Polokwane, Limpopo yesterday, to respond to the announcement. The unions said they wanted to know why the decision was only made in Limpopo while health workers in other provinces continued getting overtime pay. Since the beginning of the week, workers have been picketing during their lunch hour. Calvin Tshamano of Nehawu said they were angry that the department had started referring to them as looters. “We have done so much for frontline workers and have been subjected to a lot by the government. “We didn’t get salary increases and now Dr Mhlongo is threatening us that we won’t get Covid-19 vaccines if we continue with the strike,” he said. “The strike was not instigated by leaders of the unions, but by workers against her decision. “She was supposed to have consulted with workers, which never happened. “We found out through a circular after the decision was made.” Tshamano urged workers to start preparing for a legal strike, which starts next week Monday. Jacob Mamabolo of Denosa said that workers were demanding an unconditional reversal of the decision. Mhlongo said in 2017 and 2018, overtime cost the department just over R800 million, but it rose to more than R900 million in the 2019/2020 financial year. “There is adequate budget in this overtime amount to employ many of the unemployed young people out there. “Many much-needed posts could be filled to fix infrastructure and procure medicine and ambulances,” she said. “We must just strike a balance between personnel spending and spending on other goods and services in the interest of service delivery.”
