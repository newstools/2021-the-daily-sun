A MAN’S best friend is a common phrase used to describe dogs, but these are more than just best friends. These dogs have been trained to sniff out Covid-19. The founder of a dog training centre in Myakka City, Florida called BioScent, Heather Junqueira, has a four-year-old beagle named Noel. It only takes Noel only a few seconds to figure out which containers contain pads wiped with sweat or surgical masks worn by people infected with Covid-19. BioScent, which trains medical detection dogs, was focusing on research with canines sniffing out certain cancers. But Junqueira switched gears last April after the coronavirus pandemic hit. “I realised the importance of this research,” she told the Voice of America. Junqueira discovered it is easier for her dogs to detect Covid-19 than cancer. “The virus must have a much stronger odour, which is the body’s response to the virus,” she said, which humans cannot smell. According to the Voice of America, dogs have up to 300 million scent receptors as compared to about six million in humans. Dogs, including beagles like Noel, have famously sensitive noses. The results of her study have been “incredibly successful,” Junqueira said. The dogs recognise the Covid-19 samples about 95% of the time.
