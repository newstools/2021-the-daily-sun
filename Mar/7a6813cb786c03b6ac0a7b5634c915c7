KAIZER Chiefs talented winger Happy Mashiane will not celebrate Ernst Middendorp's downfall. The 23-year-old has been an integral part part of the Amakhosi setup this season, despite battling a niggling injury. The exciting player is one of the youngsters who made their PSL debut under then Chiefs coach Middendorp. On Wednesday, Mashiane will be looking to add to Middendorp’s woes when Amakhosi visit Maritzburg at Harry Gwala Stadium (6pm). But Mashiane says he will not celebrate should he score, out of his respect for Middendorp. "He is one of the coaches who gave me the platform. I have to respect him,” said Mashiane. “But it is nothing personal. We have to work.” The two sides first met in the MTN8 early this season when Chiefs eliminated The Team of Choice in the cup with a 2-1 victory. In January, they played again in a league match won by Maritzburg 2-1. Mashiane added:" Going to Harry Gwala won't be easy because most teams don't come back with points there." Chiefs are currently going through a rough patch as they are 10th in the league standings. They need a win at all costs to climb the log. Maritzburg are also desperate for points to avoid relegation as they are second from the bottom. "It is not a good thing that a big team like Kaizer Cheifs is tenth on the log, but we take one game as it comes. “As players, we are the ones who put ourselves in this place, and we will need to take ourselves out of it,” the player said. The Tembisa-born striker, who recently recovered from injury, admitted it won't be easy to reclaim his place in the line-up. "Coming back from injury was not easy. I had to work hard to be in the starting line-up again. I am working on being consistent and trying to prevent myself from getting injuries.”
