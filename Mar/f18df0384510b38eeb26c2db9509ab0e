Police were filmed on Wednesday, 3 March, beating a volunteer ambulance crew and shooting protesters in the streets, leaving several dead. Myanmar’s military sent a fleet of warplanes in a show of force to accompany a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests. The five low-flying jets buzzed over Mandalay in formation on Thursday, 4 March, as the military tried to stamp out opposition more than a month since seizing power in a coup. According to the Daily Mail, CCTV footage captured in the country’s largest city of Yangon on Wednesday shows armed police stopping an ambulance at gunpoint and forcing three medics out before attacking them. Six cops could be seen smashing the paramedics over the head with rifle butts, beating them with sticks, kicking them in the head and blasting out the windows of their ambulance with shotguns. “As the scale of the violence continues to increase, seemingly as part of a systematic, centralized policy to use lethal force against peaceful protestors,...Myanmar’s security forces [seem to be] perpetrating crimes against humanity” -- @ICJ_org. https://t.co/lLZcXLwGwg pic.twitter.com/LcGZCH7S0j  Grandma protests for Myanmar's democracy, Myanmar's freedom.#WhatsHappeningInMyanmar#March4Coup pic.twitter.com/pRLns8OITp  Myanmar's terrorists are killing the people of Myanmar day by day.
