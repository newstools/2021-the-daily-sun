NOT only are Mamelodi Sundowns smiling from the top of their group in the Caf Champions League. They are also celebrating a piece of history, curved when they beat TP Mazembe 2-1 in their DR Congo fortress on Saturday. In doing so, Sundowns became the first South African team to win at the Lubumbashi Stadium, winning through goals from Peter Shalulile and Lyle Lakay. Another interesting fact is that Sundowns, who are top of group C on nine points, ended Mazembe’s perfect home record as they accounted for their first home loss in the Champions League since 2009. The last time Mazembe, who have won the Champions League five times, lost at home was against Al Hilal Omdurman when they went down 2-0 to the Sudanese. They then went on a 52-match unbeaten run, beating big teams such Sundowns, Al Ahly, Zamalek, ES Setif, Wydad Casablanca, Al Merreikh, Orlando Pirates, AS Vita Club, MC Alger, Zesco United, Club Africain, Simba and Raja Casablanca. Interestingly, Sundowns are in the same group as Al Hilal and Mazembe in this season’s Champions League. The Brazilians became the first side in Champions League history to thump Al Ahly, the Caf Club of the Century, 5-0 two years ago. In the same year, Sundowns also rewrote the history books when they recorded the biggest ever victory in the Champions League when they annihilated Seychelles’ Cote d’Or 11-1 in Tshwane. Sundowns then reached the group stages by winning 16-1 on aggregate, to shatter the record of biggest win in the premier continental club competition history in grand style. They broke that of Moroccan Difaa Jadida who defeated Guinnea Bissau club Benfica 10-0 at the preliminary round in 2018.
