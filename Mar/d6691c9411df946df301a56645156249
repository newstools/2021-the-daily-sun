An Eastern Cape woman has been charged with defrauding the Road Accident Fund (RAF) of R514 000 after her husband was killed in a car accident in July 2007. Nyameka Katshwa, 48, was arrested and appeared in court on Tuesday, more than a decade after making a claim to the RAF allegedly on behalf of her husband's children. "She made the claims on behalf of her stepchildren [the deceased's minor children] who were not under her guardianship as they were staying with other relatives. "The claim was successful and a sum of R514 000-00 was paid to her by RAF. It is further reported that she never utilised the money for her stepchildrens' needs but rather for her personal use," alleged police spokesperson Captain Yolisa Mgolodela. Katshwa was released on a warning and is due back in court on 13 April.
