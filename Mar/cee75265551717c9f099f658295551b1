A drunk and gun-wielding CPF member has been captured on video threatening a man in Ekurhuleni. Though it is not clear what led to the altercation, the CPF
woman appears to be heavily intoxicated and is seen with a firearm in her hand.
She later puts it back in her vehicle and continues to harass the man who is
sitting in his car. The attempt to reprimand her by one of the CPF members on
the scene was unsuccessful as the woman could not be stopped from coming
charging towards the man's car window. Andile Andadawg shared a series of videos taken during a
heated moment. In one of them the seemingly drunk lady can be heard telling the
alleged victim, "you gonna get fucked up tonight." She then proceeded to take the man's car keys and threw them
away. Andile posted, "Not Drunk White “CPF” Harassing,
Assaulting & Pointing a FireArm on Us!!! "Tonight they tried it with the wrong Darkie, I will
not let this go.. A case with 4 charges has been opened, and I will not back
down!!! We have lost innocent lives to senseless killings. Tonight
could have easily been me, so ima teach yol a lesson" More details to follow on the story…
