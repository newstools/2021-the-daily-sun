Actor SK Khoza and presenter Siphesihle Vazi broke the internet with their nudes. The stars, who posted photos of themselves in the Eastern Cape, set tongues wagging on social media when they appeared showing their bums on Monday, 8 March. Both the actors appeared to be at the same location in the Eastern Cape when they posted the nudes. The stars didn’t indicate whether they took the pictures as part of a campaign they were working on, but they were questioned on social media about why they decided to do this. However, the pair appeared to have been on holiday in the province as part of the province’s tourism drive, which aims to show what the Eastern Cape has to offer. Posting nudes seems to have become a trend around the world.
