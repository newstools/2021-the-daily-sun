A MULTIDISCIPLINARY sting operation led to the arrest of six suspects at Kyalami Corner on Wednesday afternoon. The operation was led by the Hawks’ wildlife-trafficking team involving Pretoria-based national intervention unit, pangolin Africa attached to the University of Pretoria and Midrand detectives. According to Hawks spokeswoman Colonel Katlego Mogale, the unsuspecting syndicate, aged between 30 and 43, were pounced upon when they were looking for a buyer of one of the most protected and vulnerable species. Mogale said various exhibits were seized from the suspects for further investigation. “These includes a Toyota Fortuner, Mini Cooper, cellphones and live pangolin. The group is still being processed. Charges of dealing and possession of pangolin in contravention of the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act are being preferred against them,” she said. Mogale said the act that the suspects would be charged under aimed to provide the framework, norms and standards for the conservation, sustainable use and equitable benefit-sharing of South Africa’s biological resources. “It is in against this backdrop that the directorate for priority crime investigation strives to address these kinds of offences,” she said. She added that the suspects were expected to appear in the Midrand Magistrates Court on Friday.
