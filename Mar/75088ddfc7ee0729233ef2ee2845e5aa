PRINCE Harry and Meghan the Duchess of
Sussex have explained their dramatic exit from the royal life. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey,
Meghan revealed how she contemplated taking her own life after joining the
royal family. She said while she was pregnant, there
were “concerns” about how dark her son’s skin was going to be. The People’s Paper asked its readers what
they would do if their families were not treating their significant other well. Gabanthate Kau said: “If my family wants
to know how dark-skinned my baby will be when they are born, I’ll delete my
family completely because they are racist.” Lisa Zikhali said: “Yes, definitely if
they treat your wife badly, you as a man have the responsibility to stand up
for your wife against your family. I don’t blame Harry.” Mo Fox said: “If you are also included
and not treated well, then yes, no doubt I’d leave. If it’s only my wife, I
will try to fix it as best as I can while reminding them that I chose her. She
makes me happy and I do love her. And if it came down to choosing, I would
choose her first. If we’ve got kids, well it’s obvious, I go where my own
family goes.”
