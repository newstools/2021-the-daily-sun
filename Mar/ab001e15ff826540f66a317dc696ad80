BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic coach John Maduka says he is not scared of losing his job. Maduka is under severe pressure to turn Celtic’s fortunes around having won a mere four league games, lost eight and drawn six in the DStv Premiership so far this season. Siwelele are stuck in 11th position on 18 points from the same number of matches following a 1-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates in Soweto on Tuesday. The soft spoken mentor has been struggling to emulate the form that saw them reach two cup finals last season. “As a coach I want to win games, but I can’t predict what happens in future. Whatever happens in future is life. I didn’t know that I’ll be a Celtic coach one day, but I’m here. You might think the future is bright when it’s not so bright. Nobody thought we will make it into the top eight (last season), but we managed to sneak in for two seasons in a row. As coaches, we will continue doing our job.” Celtic are hoping to ease their problems when they host struggling Maritzburg United at Dr Molemela Stadium tomorrow (5pm). The Celtic legend praised defender Justice Chabalala for his sterling performances against Pirates. However, Maduka is unsure whether Siwelele management will extend his loan spell with the club to stay in Bloemfontein for the third season. He went on: “Chabalala was on another level. There is an agreement between the two teams. It’s not about us (deciding his future) as coaches. “He is a good player who always give his best on the pitch. But like I said, we are not the only team involved (in contract negotiations). We might want him and maybe Pirates want him as well.”
