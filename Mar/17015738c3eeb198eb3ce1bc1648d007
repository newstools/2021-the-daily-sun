THE name of this fitness club says it all, Shut Up and Gym. This is directed at people who always complain about not being disciplined enough to work out and get healthy bodies. According to Dudu Ntshaba, the founder of this gym club in Ennerdale, south of Joburg, most people have all sorts of excuses when it comes to leaving the couch and stop binge eating in front of the TV. “I started exercising at an early age while I was still in high school. I did weightlifting and then eventually moved to aerobics,” she said. It was back in 2012 when she reintroduce her fitness club to the community and get more people to live actively. The club now has more than 30 young and elderly members who meet four times a week between 6 and 7am at extension 1 park near Odin Park Primary to get in shape. “We do cardio exercises, upper body, lower body and high impact exercises because we want results,” Dudu said. She said exercising helps to boost one’s immune system, which protects them from getting diseases. “Gym also assists with slowing down the ageing process because you become strong and do many things that other old people can’t do on their own,” she said. “I’m saying this because I’ll be turning 48 next month, but I’m still going strong,” she said. Dudu said people often say gym is expensive, so she only charges a R50 monthly commitment fee. “I think staying fit and healthy is the best way we can help stay in shape and ensure our immune system is strong and able to fight for us. By exercising, you are boosting it,” said Dudu. She said a good thing about gym is that anyone can do it in their spare time. But doing it with others gives people the motivation not to miss a session. “Also hearing real life stories of how gym is positively impacting people’s lives is the best,” she said.
