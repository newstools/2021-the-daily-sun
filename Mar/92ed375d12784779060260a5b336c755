PEOPLE go on vacations or baecations for various reasons. For some, it’s for that much-needed downtime after the hustle and bustle of life. Some go on holiday as a pre-planned event and to explore the wonders of this beautiful world we live in, right? Well, not exactly. According to the tourism industry, there’s a new and fun reason for people to go on holiday, and that is called “sex tourism”. Sex tourism is defined as travel planned specifically for the purpose of sex, generally to a country where sex work is legal. It’s a sexual passport to destination sexville. And according to travel magazine HuffPost, these are the top five countries to visit for the perfect sexual getaway: 1. Brazil While the samba nation attracts carnival-goers, honeymooners, soccer fans and party-centric tourists, it is the legal prostitution in Brazil that drives numerous travellers to head to the red-light districts in cities like Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza. 2. Spain Party cities in Spain such as Madrid, Ibiza and Barcelona, which are known for their heavy club and bar scene, have also become popular destinations for sex tourism. Streets such as Gran Via in Madrid are the hub for prostitutes. 3. The Netherlands Many tourists head to Amsterdam for its scenic canals, impressive art museums and delicious cuisine. But the city also brings numerous visitors for its legal marijuana and rampant sex industry. 4. Thailand Thailand is filled with ornate temples and gorgeous beaches. But it also has some of the highest numbers for sex workers in the world. Bangkok’s well-known Patpong area is a red-light district popular with tourists for its go-go bars and sex shows. 5. The Philippines Olongapo City and Angeles City bring together those interested in sex tourism. Though prostitution is illegal, it’s easy for locals and visitors to find prostitutes at bars and massage parlours.
