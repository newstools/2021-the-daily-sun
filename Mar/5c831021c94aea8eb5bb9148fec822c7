WHEN he is not on the pitch, Erick Mathoho can be found in a makeshift studio composing songs.  Together with his childhood friends, the Kaizer Chiefs defender have formed a boy band and he could be heard belting out tunes in his spare time.  He reveals his hidden talents in a youtube video, sitting alongside"Yoki Yoki" hit singer, Vhudi Mamphwe.  His love for music started from an early age when he used to play with empty boxes, wooden sticks and old tins, together with his brothers and friends.  “Music is in my blood. It’s something I can’t live without. Music helps me when I'm stressed from football… from life,” says Mathoho. “I like to play gospel and Rumba music.”   But Mathoho, who has played over 200 games for Amakhosi, emphasised football remains a priority for him.   “But I’m focused on football, not on music. Music is just to refresh my mind,” he explains.    “Even when I have a problem, when I play instruments, I forget about my problems and everything will be sorted.”
