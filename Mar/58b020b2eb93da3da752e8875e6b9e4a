It’s been a great inspiration to see Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane take harsh action to remove all MECs accused of corruption. Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba was one of those chopped because of allegations she’s facing. All officials who’re accused of corruption should be axed from their positions as they aren’t loyal to the communities they serve. Corruption is an evil to humanity, just like apartheid was. Leaders must put the interests of the nation first.
