REALITY TV star and businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize is nurturing her son Andile Mpisane to take over her empire. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “Honestly, the decision to teach and groom Andile was simple. I don’t want my children to be left stranded when I’m no more. “I’ve witnessed this happening to many business people. You find after they draw their last breath, the kids know nothing about the business and it falls apart. I don’t want that fate for the legacy I’ve worked hard for.” She said she wanted Andile to know everything there was to know about her business. “We live in uncertain times and I want my son to understand everything I do so that he doesn’t wake up one day not being able to handle the pressure,” she said. Shauwn said she was proud of Andile and believed he was ready for any challenge. “I believe he’s at the right age and mindset to learn and take over everything as I started at the same age he is right now,” she said. “My parents would take me to their shops and I’d evaluate the work.” The Durban-based businesswoman said she was not shaken when she recently joined SABC1’s Uzalo and there was backlash. “Some of these things you can do without having to study them. I am living proof. I am an accountant by profession and never studied to be in construction, but I’ve done well” Shauwn said there would not be a second season of her reality show. “Season one did better than I expected and I’ve decided to keep it more as a legacy. It was never about entertaining people. It was more about asserting my identity,” she said.
