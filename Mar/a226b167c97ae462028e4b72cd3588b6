  The area is renamed after its most famous daughter.  The new name of the municipality, sitting in Mbizana, was signed off by Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) MEC Xolile Nqatha in a provincial Government Gazette on Thursday.  The Eastern Cape's Arts and Culture MEC Fezeka Nkomonye said her department appreciated the renaming of the municipality after Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The move immortalises Madikizela-Mandela for her selfless and massive contribution in the attainment of freedom and democracy in South Africa, said Nkomonye. Liberation "This also acknowledges the significant role played by women in the struggle for national liberation," added Nkomonye.    She said the proposal for the name was first made in 2018. Mafumbatha said: "The renaming... will preserve her name for generations to come. Winnie Madikizela Mandela married the former President Nelson Mandela here in Mbizana in June of 1958. That alone is a rich heritage that needs to be preserved and kept for generations to come." The province's Cogta spokesperson Mamkeli Ngam said the name was signed off by Nqatha after it was proposed by Mbizana Municipality following a consultation processes. The municipality, situated on the Wild Coast, in the former Transkei, has 31 wards. The council is made up of 62 councillors and 12 traditional leaders. Asked if there were more municipalities in line for renaming, Nkomonye said: "The need to rename other municipalities in the Eastern Cape will result from public participation processes and consultations that local authorities conduct from time to time. "Cogta and municipalities will handle those processes on their own. The department and the Eastern Cape provincial Geographical Names Committee will only assist on areas (where)  Cogta and municipalities need clarity or support."
