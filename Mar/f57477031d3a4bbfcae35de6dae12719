ANC councillor in Alfred Duma Municipality, David Mazibuko, was excited as he left Ladysmith Magistrates Court on Friday, 19 March. This after the magistrate withdrew the case against Mazibuko, who was accused of stealing two JoJo tanks. Last May, Mazibuko was arrested after a case of stealing was opened against him. Mazibuko was released on R2 000 bail and then he started appearing in court. It is alleged that in each of Mazibuko’s court appearances, the complainant never showed up. It is said that it was for this reason that the magistrate ended up withdrawing the case. Mazibuko told Daily Sun that he was excited that the magistrate has thrown the case out of court. “It wasn’t supposed to go to court in the first place. When those JoJo tanks were found in my home, they had been delivered by the suppliers for them to be used by residents in my ward. “They had been there for only seven days and as a councillor I was still going to arrange a proper way of how they were going to benefit residents from 12 villages under my ward,” said Mazibuko. He said his arrest was comical because the JoJo tanks that the municipality had ordered for 36 wards were all delivered to the homes of every councillor. “Each councillor got two JoJo tanks and they were delivered to their homes, but I was the only councillor that was arrested,” said Mazibuko. He said when he analysed his arrest, he concluded that it had nothing to do with JoJo tanks. "The arrest was just one of his (the complainant's) ways of dragging my name through the mud,” said Mazibuko. He said he was happy that the case was withdrawn. When Daily Sun tried to get comment, the complainant asked why he was not being seen face to face and said he did not want to speak over the phone. Josiah Gumede branch convener Nkosinathi Shabalala also said the arrest was politically motivated.
