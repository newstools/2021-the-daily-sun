THE sentencing of a sangoma convicted of raping his client had to be delayed again because his lawyer couldn’t avail himself on Thursday. Amos Motlhale’s first date of sentencing, 13 January, was postponed after magistrate Thabo Lephadi died just before sentencing. Yesterday, his lawyer was nowhere to be found. The sangoma was convicted of raping a client in 2017. Motlhale had previously told the court the sex was consensual, and that he didn’t force himself on her. According to court documents, the woman wanted the sangoma to help her find a job. The sangoma then made a fire and threw muthi inside. He took ashes of the muthi and asked her to open her legs before inserting them inside her punani. He convinced the woman that for the muthi to be thoroughly inserted in her punani, he had to penetrate her. That was where the alleged raped occurred. After consultation, the woman went straight to the cop shop. The sangoma was arrested on the same day. Sentencing was postponed to 4 April.
