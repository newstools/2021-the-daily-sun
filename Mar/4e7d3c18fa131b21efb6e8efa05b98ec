THE offices in a dilapidated hall that five families were moved into were meant to be a three-week arrangement. But 16 years later, the families are still living in the hall in Bhambayi in Inanda, Durban. The five offices have since been turned into living quarters. But thete are no toilet facilities, no water or electricity. Sizakele Zuma, who lives with her nine children, said they were moved from Ghandi area to the hall by officials from eThekwini Municipality. “We were told to pack our bags, loaded onto a truck and dumped in this hall,” said Sizakele. She told Daily Sun her boyfriend had sine died in the hall. Sizakele said ward councillor, Sithembiso Zulu, registered their names for RDP houses but nothing has come of it.  “Last year, he brought officials to verify the number of people living here. We were hopeful when we saw RDPs being built close by, but they were given to other people,” she said. Ntombifikike Mbewana, who also lives inside the hall, said: “We are a family of 15 sharing one small room.” Councillor Sithembiso, who has been the councillor since 2016, said he met with the residents but never promised them houses. “Those RDPs are for the disaster victims. I have raised their matter with the municipality,” he said. eThekwini Municipality’s Princess Nkabane said Daily Sun’s query was forwarded to the relevant department. The municipality had not responded to our query at the time of going to print.
