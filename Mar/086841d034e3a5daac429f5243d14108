MKHULU trusted his nephew with his dream and money. Little did he know the nephew had other plans. And now, Julius Marukulu’s dream of building a house has gone up in smoke. The 73-year-old told Daily Sun he saved R20 000 from his social grant money to buy land and build a house for himself. He said his nephew told him he was into property and had land for him and his wife. “I trusted him because he never gave me a reason not to. I deposited the money and my nephew promised he’ll get the paperwork done in no time,” he said. Mkhulu Julius said they didn’t involve the police as his nephew is family and thought he would eventually come through. “But he started ignoring our calls and they sometimes went straight to voicemail. We knew something was wrong. We went to his house and he told us these things take time and we should be patient,” he said. Madala said they gave him six months, but nothing happened. “I guess I gave him more time to make a fool of me. I’m so sad.” He said his health gave him problems and couldn’t use taxis anymore. “I had to hire transport to see my nephew. I used R1 000 for one trip only for him to chase me away like a dog. “I thought of letting this go, but it’s hard because I’m tired of being an old man moving from one mkhukhu to the next,” he said. “My nephew is living his best life. He’s financially stable and his kids own cars. I don’t understand why he would do this to me.” Mkhulu’s wife, Margaret (68), said she also tried to speak to the nephew, but he wanted nothing to do with them. “We’re too old to live like this. He is family and we involved him because we didn’t trust anyone else,” she said. Daily Sun couldn’t get hold of the nephew.
