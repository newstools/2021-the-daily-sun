IT is always an honour to represent one's national team. Cape Town City FC player Craig Martin, honored with a Bafana Bafana call-up, says he is ready to represent the national team with excellence. Martin is one of three players (Veli Mothwa, Ben Motshwari) who received their maiden Bafana call-ups for the back-to-back 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan later this month. Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki made his squad announcement on Thursday. "A new face in the Bafana Bafana team, Craig has been doing very well for Cape Town City," Ntseki said. "He has even kept the captain (Thami Mkhize) out of the team. He has been playing as a right-back or right wing-back with his energy levels. He added: "If you also look at the generation of players that he comes from, he's born in 1993, so we felt he's a player for the future to compete on the right with Morena and the rest of the guys." Talking after the squad announcement, the 27-year-old Martin said: "I am honoured to be called up to the national team. I have worked hard, waiting for this opportunity. I have been playing in various positions for Cape Town City, and they have selected me. I will do my outmost best in any position that I play in (in the national team)." Attacker Ruzaigh Gamildien also made a long-awaited return to the national squad having been in fine form in front of goal this season for Swallows FC.
