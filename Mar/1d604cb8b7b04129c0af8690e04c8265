A FIREARM injury was confirmed as Mthokozisi Ntumba’s cause of death. This was according to investigating officer Judie Thwala’s affidavit, which was read in the Joburg Magistrates Court yesterday. Officers Tshephisho Kekana (27), Cidraas Motseothata (43), Madimetja Legodi (37) Victor Mohammed (51), arrested in connection with Ntumba’s death, were in court for a bail application. In his affidavit, Thwala said: “It was established by the pathologist that the cause of death was due to the firearm-related injury to the chest. The ballistic expert confirmed that the deceased was shot with a rubber bullet at close range. “It was also confirmed during the crime scene reconstruction that the distance from which the applicants fired shows was approximately 4m.” The four officers, charged with murder, attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice, intended to plead not guilty. Accused number one, Kekana, told the court he needed to get bail as he had a two-year-old. He said he had no previous convictions and didn’t have a passport. Motseothata said: “I handed myself to police after I was advised they were looking for me.” He said he had no previous convictions and would not be able to support his family if he didn’t get bail. Legodi said he had two kids who were dependent on him. He said he had no pending cases but had two previous convictions for drinking and driving. Mohammed said he had no prior convictions or pending cases.
