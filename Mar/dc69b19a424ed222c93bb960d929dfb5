The 
police have cautioned the public against purchasing fake vaccines from 
unscrupulous people looking to cash in on the Covid-19 pandemic. The
 warning followed a raid on a warehouse and the apprehension of four 
people in Germiston, Gauteng, last year. They were found in possession 
of 400 doses of fake Covid-19 vaccines and fake N95 masks worth 
millions. Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said 
investigators feared the four accused, leading up to their arrest, had 
already advertised that a vaccine was on sale. "No approved 
vaccines are currently available for sale online or physically. Any 
person who buys these drugs is putting themselves at risk and giving 
their money to organised criminals. "Police will continue to 
detect and investigate anyone involved in the organised syndicates 
trying to enrich themselves by smuggling and distributing unregistered 
and illicit medicine," added Muridili. The four accused - Zhang 
Jian, 30,Â Liang Pengcheng, 31, Chen Jianfu, 41 and Charles Chigwedere, 
45 - made their most recent appearance in the Germiston Magistrate's 
Court on 19 February. They were charged with the contravention of
 Counterfeit Goods Act, the Customs and Excise Act and Medicines and 
Related Substances Act. Their case was postponed to 28 May for further investigation. News24
