the Year award.  Cornal Hendricks was named the
Carling Currie Cup Player of the Year while Jaco Peyper took the Referee of the
Year accolade.  “It was a very tough season
but Duane was superb – not only on the field, where his performances were on
par with the very high standard we’ve become accustomed to from him, but he
also led the Bulls with aplomb as our teams had to navigate numerous new curve
balls and challenges,” said Mr Mark Alexander, President of SA Rugby.  “The pandemic has been
disruptive to people from all walks of life and apart from the hard work done
in training, first at home and later back at their team bases, it was
heartening to see our players rolling up their sleeves and also helping fellow
South Africans who are not as fortunate. We saw yet again that we are stronger, together.”  The winners
