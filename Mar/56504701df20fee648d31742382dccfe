TWO students who were allegedly part of the ongoing fees protests in Braamfontein were arrested on Wednesday after being found with a high-calibre firearm. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said in the past week, police had been on high alert monitoring protests by students at various tertiary institutions in Gauteng. “A crime intelligence report about a dangerous weapon was operationalised and led police to a gathering in Braamfontein, where students were in attendance. “Members observed two students in Stiemens Street carrying an automatic rifle.  “The officers kept a close watch and saw the pair driving off in a vehicle. It was followed and ultimately stopped.” She said police searched the vehicle and found an automatic rifle of Israeli make, with a loaded magazine. “A 24-year-old male suspect and 21-year-old female suspect were arrested, and are expected to appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court on two charges of possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition, as well as possession of a dangerous weapon.”
