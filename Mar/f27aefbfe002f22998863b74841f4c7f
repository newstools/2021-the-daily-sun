MARITZBURG United are determined to make amends for their poor performances in the first round of the season. That is the promise from midfielder Phumlani Ntshangase, starting when they visit TS Galaxy at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday (5pm) in a crunch DStv Premiership clash. He said things have started better in the second round of the season for the Midlands-based club. In the first round, the Team of Choice picked up only nine points from 15 matches. But since the second round started, Maritzburg, in three league matches, have won one and drew the other two to collect five points from a possible nine. Ntshangase said this has positively impacted the team. “This is good for the team. We need more positive results now,” he said. Maritzburg lost their opening five games in all competitions. That led to the sacking of coach Eric Tinkler on 23 November last year. Three days later, Ernst Middendorp was appointed in what is his fourth stint with the club. But the club are still in the relegation zone. They are second bottom with 14 points from 18 games, two ahead of bottom side Black Leopards. “The first round was difficult but we have passed that now,” added Ntshangase. “The second round looks good. Obviously (not losing in the second round) is a good motivation for us and a big boost going forward.” Maritzburg will be looking for revenge against Galaxy after they were thrashed 3-0 by Owen Da Gama’s side in the first round at Harry Gwala Stadium in January.
