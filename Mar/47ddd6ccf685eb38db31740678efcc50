SIR Alex Ferguson had an 80% chance of death following a brain haemorrhage in May 2018, his doctor has revealed. The legendary football manager (79) admitted in his upcoming documentary Never Give In, that he had a 20% chance of survival. The former Manchester United manager said: “I remember falling and so after that I don’t remember a thing. “It was sudden. It stopped. It just stopped. It was no man’s land.” His doctor added: “So I remember estimating his mortality – at that point in time it was 80%. “It was an 80% chance he would not survive.” The documentary, which premiered at the Glasgow Film Festival at the weekend and will be able to be seen in cinemas from 27 May, was directed by Sir Alex’s son, Jason (51). Speaking alongside his son during a virtual Q&A after the premiere, Sir Alex said the recovery from the operation was terrifying. He said: “I lost my voice, just could not get a word out, and that was terrifying – absolutely terrifying. “And everything was going through my mind: is my memory going to come back? Am I ever going to speak again?” The iconic Scotsman, who grew up in Govan, Glasgow, also revealed in the well-anticipated documentary how he went “off the rails” as a youngster playing for St Johnstone – and became estranged from his father for two years due to his partying antics. Sir Alex revealed: “I started to… how do I put it? I went off the rails a bit. “Out on the town an all. I started going out Friday nights even, even the night before a game. “My dad would say, ‘Where are you going?’, I’d say ‘I’m going out dancing’… He said, ‘You can’t go out dancing if you’ve got a game tomorrow.’” – THE SUN
