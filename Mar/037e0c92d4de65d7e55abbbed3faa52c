The alcohol industry has applauded the government's
decision to implement a partial ban against alcohol sales over the Easter
weekend, instead of a complete ban. It says R36 billion in sales revenue has already been
lost over the last year. During an address on Tuesday, President Cyril
Ramaphosa announced that the country would stay on a Level 1 lockdown over
Easter but that alcohol sales would be restricted to onsite venues for the long
weekend. The South African Liquor Brand owners Association
(Salba) welcomed the move to avoid a total ban, which was put into place on
three occasions over the past 12 months. The bans have amounted to 19 weeks of lost trading
days, leading to a R36-billion loss in sales revenue for the industry and a
R29-billion loss in tax revenue loss for the government, the Salba said in a
statement. Salba chairperson Sibani Mngadi said it was important
to improve consultation levels between the government and the alcohol industry
with the common objectives of limiting the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and
turning around the South African economic trajectory towards a growth path. "The decision to keep the on-consumption trading
environment open under the licence conditions and limitations of the curfew is
very much welcome. Taverns, bars, restaurants are a critical part of the
tourism business which we need to assist to recover," said Mngadi. "There is a need for more engagement with the
government to better understand the thinking that informs restrictions of the
off-consumption channel, which has been limited to four days a week [of] trade
at various stages of the lockdown." SOURCE: NEWS24
