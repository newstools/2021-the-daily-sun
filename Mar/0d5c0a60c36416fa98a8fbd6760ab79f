CHAOS broke out at Dr Pixley Ka Isaka Seme Memorial Hospital in KwaMashu, north of Durban yesterday. This after the Department of Health called 250 nurses for assessment tests. About 3 000 people showed up, which resulted in long queues. Some people were asked to leave. But chaos broke out when they refused to go and cops had to be called in. A nurse, who asked not to be named, told Daily Sun she got a call to come for an interview but was shocked to find many people in the queue. “There’s no social distancing. Some people jumped the queue as they wanted to get inside. There was no order at all,” said the nurse. Another nurse said: “The department didn’t plan this properly. “We waited for several hours and they didn’t call us according to the list they made but took anyone into the tent to write the test.” Health spokesman Ntokozo Maphisa said information about the assessment process seemingly spread through word of mouth. He said attempts were made to disperse the restless crowd. Said Maphisa: “But the crowd soon became hostile and police advised that exercising control would be difficult if those in the queues decided to rebel. “It was then agreed that the police would continue to assist with crowd control, while the department fast-tracks the recruitment process. “We apologise to the candidates who were invited to write assessment tests.” Maphisa said while they understood that the rate of unemployment is high in the country, all citizens had a responsibility to abide by the law.
