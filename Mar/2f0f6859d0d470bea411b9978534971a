Community members need to stop taking the law into their own hands. It doesn’t matter how much pain we feel, it’s unlawful to take the law into your own hands. Innocent people often get killed when community members deal with crime themselves. Some don’t involve the police at all. Everybody is innocent until proven guilty. The culture of attacking and killing people is becoming a trend in some townships, despite continued calls by police not to do so. We need to learn to leave everything in the hands of the police. They are trained to deal with such things. If people have any information, they should take it to the police. I know that communities are tired of thieves that break into their houses and steal from them. However, they are not allowed to take the law into their own hands.
