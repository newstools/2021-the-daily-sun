BEFORE she died Mapula Khune (27) had a vision of police and ambulances surrounding her house. This was revealed by her mother Florah, who shared how she learnt about her daughter’s death. Mapula’s burnt body was found in the backroom of her parent’s home last week. Mapula was soccer player Itumeleng Khune’s sister. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested for her murder on Sunday, 7 March. But he was set free by the Ventersdorp Magistrates Court due to insufficient evidence. Florah said on the morning of the incident, she hesitated when she heard from a neighbour that her house was on fire. She dismissed firefighters, saying they might have their facts wrong. “After sending them away, I found out that the backroom was indeed on fire. My husband and I screamed, hoping our daughter was not inside,” she said. Florah said the night before the incident, a young boy came looking for Mapula. “He wanted her to help him with his homework. I directed him to where Mapula was. Her cousin came later and helped the boy as Mapula told him she had a vision. “She said she saw ambulances, fire trucks and police,” she said. She said Mapula then went to rest while her cousin helped the boy. Next thing, she received a call from a neighbour saying her house was on fire. The Khune family said they expected to bury Mapula on Thursday, 11 March, but the date might change as they were awaiting forensic results. But NPA spokesman Henry Mamothame said following a thorough study of the docket and consultation with police, the NPA resolved that the docket be returned for further investigations and the accused be released.
