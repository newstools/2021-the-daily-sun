PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has told traditional leaders consultations on their powers and functions agreed to last year will not be conducted due to Covid-19. Opening the House of Traditional Leaders in Cape Town yesterday, Ramaphosa said regulations made it impossible for consultations to go ahead. “We will need to be creative about consultation mechanisms under the new conditions that Covid-19 has imposed on us to ensure we reach all sectors of society,” Ramaphosa said. The consultations were meant to discuss transforming traditional leadership in line with the Constitution. Ramaphosa said there was some legal progress. He gave the examples of new customary marriage laws, waiting for his signature and the Khoi-San Act, that comes into effect on 1 April. “This is a significant milestone. The country’s Khoi and San leaders will, after following the prescribed processes, for the first time enjoy official recognition and serve in the national and provincial house,” he said. Ramaphosa praised leaders for their contribution to the battle against the pandemic, especially for allowing the closure of initiation schools. He said although it was hard to suspend initiation in all provinces at the height of the pandemic, it saved a lot of people. “When the regulations were eased and some schools reopened, you worked with us to create awareness around health and safety.” Ramaphosa also reported back on the Presidential Summit on Land. He said although consultations could not take place, an inter-ministerial committee had been continuing its work on key issues. He said the committee had analysed lessons learnt from other countries such as Ghana, Botswana and Uganda.
