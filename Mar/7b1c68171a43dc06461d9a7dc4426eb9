HE INNOCENTLY greeted his female neighbour. But this led to him being allegedly terrorised by izikhothane. Xolani Dippenaar now lives in fear of the group. The 15-year-old from extension 18 in Mamelodi East, Tshwane said the group was against youngsters who talked to young girls in their kasi. He said he paid a heavy price on Monday, 22 February for greeting his neighbour. “I was hit on the head with a brick. The gang even terrorises me when I go to the shops and on my way to school. I’m suffering for merely greeting my neighbour,” he said. Xolani said he needed help as these izikhothane will end up killing him. His sister Salome (20) said the young boys bullied her brother. “These boys are bothering other kids as well. They are armed with pepper spray and knives. “I don’t know how and where they get such weapons. “We are worried and scared for my brother’s safety,” she said. Xolani’s mother, Primrose (40), said she needed help keeping her son safe. She said her son was even scared of going to school as the group threatened to set dogs on him. “I want justice for my boy,” she told the People’s Paper. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said police opened a case of assault. “No arrests have been made yet as the investigation is continuing,” he said.
