A Lion keeper has lost his life after he was allegedly attacked and killed by two lions today Dead Malibongwe Mfila (27) was reportedly an employee as a tracker at Maratana Safari Lodge in the Waterberg District, Limpopo when the incident occurred. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo the spokesman for Limpopo police says it is alleged that killed Mfila was busy driving around in the bush checking where animals such as Elephants, Lions and others were to advise the guides as and when they do game drives. Mojapelo said, "He then reportedly decided to stop the vehicle and get out and as he was walking, he was suddenly attacked and killed by two Lionesses." "Someone who was also driving inside the park noticed these two Lions busy devouring the deceased and he then alerted the Park Manager who alerted the police. The lions were found still attacking the deceased and were both immediately put down," he said. According to a statement released by the
More Family Collection, the owners of Marataba Luxury Lodges, Mfila was a FGASA
Level 3 qualified tracker. "He was tracking wildlife as part of
his usual duties on the Marataba Contractual National Park. He was following up
on cheetah tracks and appears to have alighted from the vehicle, as per
procedure, when the incident occurred. He had walked just 20 metres from the
vehicle when he came upon two young male lions hidden in the thicket. The lions
attacked and killed him," said the statement. Marataba's Park Management confirmed the
two lions had been euthanised so that post mortems could be conducted. "Malibongwe was an integral part of
the Marataba Luxury Lodges field guiding team, who always conducted himself in
a professional manner and had great promise for a very successful future. The
Marataba family is devastated by this loss. His sunny disposition coupled with
his natural talent will be sorely missed," said Robert More, CEO and owner
of the More Family Collection.
