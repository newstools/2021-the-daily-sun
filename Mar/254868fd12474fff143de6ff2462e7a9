BAROKA FC young striker Evidence “Tower” Makgopa said it is his dream to play for South Africa Under-23 squad in the Tokyo Olympics Games this year. But the 20-year-old, who made his debut for Baroka last season, said his focus now is to continue working hard and help his team finish in the top eight. This season Makgopa has been one of the trusted players for coach Thoka Matsimela, and has netted five DStv Premiership goals. “It is every young player’s dream to represent his country in international competitions,” said Makgopa. “This season has been good for me. I have been playing regularly and for me, it shows that the coach believes in me. I will continue to work hard and improve my game. My hope now is to continue with that form and avoid injuries until the end of the season. “It is my dream to play in the Olympics Games this year. But at the end of the day, it’s up to (SA Under-23) coach David Notoane to select his best team for the Olympics. “My focus now is to see Baroka do well and to score more goals this season. It will be a huge achievement for us to finish in the top eight. And with the team and the coach we have, I believe we can achieve our goal.” Thoka said he will also be the happiest man if Makgopa can get a call up to the Olympics squad. “Makgopa has been improving game by game,” said Thoka. “What I love about Makgopa is that he is committed and works hard all the time. He is a boy with ambition in football. The good thing is that he (Makgopa) is still young and the future looks bright for him if stays focused. I am happy with his form this season.” The Olympics Games are set to start in mid-July. Baroka host Stellenbosch FC in their next league encounter at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday (5pm).
