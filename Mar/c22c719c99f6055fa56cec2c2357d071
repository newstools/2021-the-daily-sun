IT WAS a time for the singing of amahubo nd chanting of Zulu slogans as amabutho, izintombi and royal house princes bid a special farewell to King Goodwill Zwelithini. Amabutho walked alongside the hearse carrying the king’s remains for about 10km from the local mortuary in Nongoma to the KwaKhethomthandayo Royal Palace yesterday. Izintombi marched in Nongoma town and waited at the palace. When rain and thunder came, as they were about to arrive at the palace, they said it was blessings coming from heaven. The king’s remains were brought to KwaKhethomthandayo for the royal family to perform their ritual before privately planting the king during the night.  Amabutho commanding general Mlandeni “Mgilija” Nhleko said the rain and thundering were signs that God and Zulu ancestors had accepted the king. “The king was closer to the heaven. During his installation as the king 50 years ago, it was raining and rivers were overflowing. We expected that it would rain when we bring him to the palace,” he said. Royal house spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu told Daily Sun the king’s remains were brought home to perform many royal house rituals before the planting. “The king will be laid to rest at KwaDlamahlahla next to other Zulu kings,” said Prince Thulani.  The king’s special official category one funeral, changed to a memorial prayer service, will be held at KwaKhethomthandayo today. It will be attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The king died on Friday, 12 March after being in hospital for a month.
