FOLLOWING many discussions, queen mother Manyaku Thulare was chosen as acting queen of the Bapedi nation. This followed the death of King Victor Thulare III two months ago. Queen Manyaku has always been the central pillar of the royal family and was her late son’s pillar of strength. Royal family spokesman Ntoampe Mampuru said the appointment came at a time when South Africa continued to recognise and advance the rights of women in positions of power and leadership in all sectors of society. He said the appointment would restore order in the Pedi royal house. “Her appointment is very significant on many fronts as it will help us continue to go through what is still a very difficult period of mourning,” he said. “Her appointment put to rest any fears about the succession process following a difficult and protracted legal dispute over the headship to the throne. “Her appointment is a vote of confidence in the abilities of women not only in traditional leadership, but leadership in general.” Mampuru said Queen Manyaku has always loved Pedi people and stopped at nothing to ensure their needs were always at the forefront. A date for the queen mother’s coronation is yet to be announced.
