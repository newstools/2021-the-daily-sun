MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi has shared his opinion on his new boss Tlhopane Motsepe. Tlhopane, the son of newly elected Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) president Patrice Motsepe, will take over as the new Sundowns chairman. Mngqithi said he is looking forward to working with Tlhopie, as he's known, describing him as a “humble and intelligent” young man. “This is one of the best decisions that a father can take,” said Mngqithi on the appointment of Tlhopane as new Downs chairman. “Tlhopie is a very good boy. He is very intelligent, very humble and very principled and for me there is no chance that he will fail. “He also has us as his elders to assist him. And because he is humble it is easier for him to grasp everything. “He has everything required to be a good leader and honestly speaking I am looking forward to seeing him taking charge because I know what he is capable of. “Fortunately, we have been working with him in various other projects in the team. One thing I can tell is that he is a very good person, you will like him. He is destined to be a good leader.”  At Mamelodi Sundowns, Tlhopane Motsepe has long been groomed to take on an executive role. He is said to be the mastermind of the Sing with Sundowns, an on-going reality show-type format national singing competition, with a R1 million first prizehttps://t.co/E9f0NhCk7I
