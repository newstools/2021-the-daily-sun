The end of life happens unexpectedly. No one lives forever. Most people don’t accept the passing of their loved ones. As a result, some start using substances in an attempt to cope with the pain. Others end up committing suicide because they feel useless without the deceased. Death is a terrible experience of pain and grief, but to hold on to it is self-destructive behaviour. There are people who lose everything due to the depression that sets in. In this context, depression has a more damaging effect on an individual. To beat the cycle of misery, we should consult a psychologist for counselling or frequently go out with friends and family. We are all going to die one day, and there’s only one life to live. So, let go of the dead and enjoy each moment as if it’s your last. - Letter by Lusanda Mahlasela, Joburg
