CAPE Town City winger Aubrey Ngoma is elated to be playing again and says it feels good to be back. Ngoma joined the Citizens on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns last October in a swap deal with Kermit Erasmus. But his return was marred by injury. The 31-year-old picked a hamstring injury during training with the Mother City club. He was given his first start by coach Jan Old Riekerink against Chippa United earlier this month, playing 61 minutes in a goalless draw at Gqeberha’s Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. The former Orlando Pirates winger opened his scoring account last weekend, but it wasn’t enough as City lost 2-1 to their neighbours Stellenbosch. “It feels good to be back on the field. It is every player’s happy place,” said Ngoma. “I am grateful to Cape Town City for the opportunity to take me back and also for the chairman (John Comitis) and the coach for being patient with me. “I need to be patient with myself because I haven’t played a lot of football in a very long time. And to get back to full fitness will take some time, but I have a very supportive technical team and teammates helping me all the time. “So it’s still going to take a lot of games until I am back to full fitness.” Downs signed him in the second half of 2017-18 season alongside Jeremy Brockie and Gaston Sirino, after a brilliant season with the Citizens in 2016-17 season. And now back into familiar territory, where Ngoma was the founding member of the team that he helped win the Telkom Knockout in 2016-17 season, he told SunSport that a lot of things have changed at City. “A lot of things have improved on and off the pitch since I left, and it’s encouraging to see what the club has achieved in just a short space of time,” added Ngoma. “Fortunately, we have a very good squad with talented and hard working players. “I can’t be an exception thinking that a place is guaranteed for me in the team. “What is important is that I have to work hard.”
