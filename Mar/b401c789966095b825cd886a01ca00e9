MZANSI was left divided after a white woman used blackface to look like Nomcebo Zikode on an international TV show. Some were furious after watching a video of the woman performing Master KG’s Jerusalema in blackface. But others thought there was nothing wrong with it because it has been done for years. The woman was performing in a Bulgarian singing competition called Kato Abe Kankm Boaa. "It would be entertaining if blackface wasn't connected to a very racist history. You can Google that and also what actually happened to Leon (Schuster) for the blackface stunts," said Fikz. Aaron Manana said he is disgusted by this and said it makes it seem like black people's lives are seen as entertainment. ALSO READ: UZALO'S GC MAKES A TV COMEBACK! "The problem is not the song or singing, but the imitation of a black person. I will wait and see when a white woman performs a Beyonce song while wearing a Beyonce face," said Utheyalakh. "There's nothing wrong here. This is like Idols singing Beyonce, Usher and Brandy's songs. I'm proud of Master KG and Nomcebo," Maqhobozakwasani tweeted. Sandile Collin questioned why it's acceptable for black people to do this while it's unacceptable for white people to do the same. "Rest bafethu. This is just a talent show or Lip Sync Battle equivalent on steroids. It happens all the time. Let's just celebrate our artists and stop fighting unnecessary battles," Zihle tweeted. "If this was a Lip Sync Battle show and a black contestant picked a white artist we would laugh and see the humor. Mara cause its the other way round we cry wolf," Mo waNtlhe tweeted. What’s this? How did we get here? #Nomcebo pic.twitter.com/wGNANxf4t3
