NEW Bizana Pondo Chiefs coach Clinton Larsen has made his first signing just days after he was appointed by the struggling GladAfrica Championship side. Larsen has signed striker Lerato Manzini, who was a free agent after leaving Ajax Cape Town (now Cape Town Spurs) at the end of last season. The former Golden Arrows coach is beefing up his squad that is struggling to get results since they were promoted to the Championship this season. Pondo are at the bottom of the Championship with 14 points from 18 games. The club have not won any of their last six league games, losing four and drawing the other two. A club statement confirmed the new signing: “Bizana Pondo Chiefs has completed a contract deal with the forward, Lerato Manzini. “The 29-year-old forward will provide Hunters with a wealth of experience in the club and has already started training with the club. His contract deal will start immediately and ends at the end of the season.” Manzini is familiar with Larsen. The former Maritzburg United coach promoted the Welkom-born striker at Bloemfontein Celtic at the beginning of 2011-12 season. They helped Celtic win the Telkom Knockout the following season “We are delighted to welcome Lerato Manzini, his pedigree is a welcomed addition to the team,” said chairman Nkosinathi Mqokiyana. “He is someone who our young players will certainly draw inspiration from. We are confident that Manzini will fit in seamlessly into our team and will thrive with the unique culture that we have.” Manzini could make his debut for Chiefs when they travel to TS Sporting on 4 April for their next fixture.
