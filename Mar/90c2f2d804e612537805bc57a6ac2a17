RICHARDS Bay FC coach Simo Dladla’s priority is winning promotion. But Dladla says he won’t tell his players that his focus is not on the Nedbank Cup. But he wants to do well in this season’s competition after reaching the quarter-finals by beating fellow GladAfrica Championship side TS Sporting 2-1 at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday. They will now face Chippa United in the Ke Yona Cup quarter-finals in Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth), which is likely to be played at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium later this month. But Dladla’s goal is to cement their top place in the Championship and gain promotion at the end of the season, as per the mandate given to Dladla by his chairman Sifiso Biyela. The KwaZulu-Natal side are at the summit of the Championship with 27 points from 15 games, three points ahead of second placed Sekhukhune United and third-placed JDR Stars respectively. “I don’t have goals for this competition and it should end when it ends,” added Dladla. “It is just a dream that will end and it is not important really. “The important thing for us is the league and that’s where our focus is.”
