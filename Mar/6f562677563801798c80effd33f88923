Two people
who allegedly shot and robbed two security guards in a cash-in-transit heist in
KwaZulu-Natal have been arrested. The
suspects, aged 28 and 34, allegedly carried out a cash-in-transit heist at a
petrol station in Osizweni earlier this month. "It is
alleged that on 1 March 2021 at about 13:00, security guards were collecting
cash at one of the service stations in the area when they were accosted by the
armed suspects. Two guards were shot at and robbed of their service firearms,
as well as an undisclosed amount of cash," Hawks spokesperson Captain
Simphiwe Mhlongo said. The robbers
fled in a getaway vehicle, which was later found abandoned nearby. "Members
received information that the suspects were in Gauteng and yesterday a joint
operation was conducted. The two were arrested and charged with armed robbery,
as well as attempted murder," Mhlongo said. They were
expected to appear in the Madadeni Magistrate's Court on Friday. SOURCE:
