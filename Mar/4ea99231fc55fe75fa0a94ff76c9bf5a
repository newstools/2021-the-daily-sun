for a week, but during an interview with Daily Sun on Tuesday, 16 March,
the family spokesperson, Pastor Khabo Nyikiza said there was a reason for that. “When she was working, two weeks would go by without hearing
from her because she was usually busy,” he said. But the family became worried when she didn’t answer her
phone for a week. “Her brother sent someone to check on her because she wasn’t
answering her phone. Unfortunately, they couldn’t enter because the security
guard didn’t let them in. Before entering, the security guard must first check
with the resident and if the resident doesn’t answer, then the visitor won’t be
let in,” he said. Her memorial service will be held at the Market Theatre on
Wednesday, 24 March at 12pm.
