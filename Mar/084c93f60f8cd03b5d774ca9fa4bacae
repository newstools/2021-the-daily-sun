ANGRY residents of Refilwe, near Cullinan, held a sit-in protest at their local municipal offices from Tuesday, 23 March, to Friday. The residents, protesting against a lack of service delivery by the City of Tshwane, said they planned to continue on Monday, 29 March. They said they were still waiting for promises made by the DA-led administration five years ago to be kept. Officials had promised to move them from their informal settlement to a better area. Moses Maseko (45) said there had been no projects to benefit residents in the area and their councillor was nowhere to be found. “We are told he is in Cape Town. We don’t know what he is doing there when he is being paid to serve us here in Refilwe,” he said. Martin Chabe (62) said they were tired of being taken for a ride by the municipality. “They are left with three months in power but if we ask them what they have done for us, they won’t be able to answer. “Only people in the suburbs enjoy municipal services. In informal settlements, we are left to suffer,” he said. Residents vowed to continue with their protest until Mayor Randall Williams and the councillors addressed them. Rachel Tshidanga (36) said they would sleep at the municipal offices for as long as it took. “We will bring our blankets and pots to cook there and make ourselves comfortable,” she said. City of Tshwane acting chief of staff Jordan Griffiths said he was aware of the protests. He said the councillor had resigned. “The former councillor left his post last year after he fell sick. We still need to fill the post,” he said.
