It’s shocking and devastating that today’s world is full of dishonest people who scam others of their hard-earned money. It’s heartbreaking that our fellow citizens are being robbed of their money by scammers through fake SMSes. The scammers state that you have won a competition and have to make a payment into their bank account to claim your prize. If you didn’t enter any competition, it’s highly likely that you didn’t win anything but could actually lose money if you entertain these scams. Sadly, some of our fellow citizens have already lost their hard-earned money to these scammers after responding to fong kong SMSes. Please, don’t fall prey to these scammers! Think carefully before you SMS your personal details. There’s no way that you can win a competition you didn’t enter. Our fellow citizens should never give their personal details such as address, ID number or bank account number to strangers. The worst thing is that these scammers use cellphones with SIM cards that have not been Rica’d, and it’s difficult for them to be traced. Citizens must always protect their money by being vigilant when they get SMSes stating that they’ve won competitions that they never entered. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Be vigilant at all times. - Letter by Andries Kabini, Rockville
