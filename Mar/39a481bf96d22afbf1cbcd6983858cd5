METRO FM DJ Mo Flava may soon be leaving the SABC for Primedia’s 94.7 to replace the axed DJ Fresh and Euphonik on the afternoon drive slot. The two were axed recently following rape accusations. Well-placed sources told Daily Sun the seasoned broadcaster was approached by Primedia to replace the DJs because they wanted someone with credibility. “They wanted someone who’ll redeem the station from the recent rape drama that has been unfolding in the public recently. They feel their image has been dented. “After long discussions, they agreed Mo Flava was the perfect man for the job.” Mo Flava’s radio experience and clean public image were apparently the deciding factors that made him a top contender to replace the fired stars. “He’s been in the radio industry for many years and has never been involved in any scandal, even at the SABC. And the fact that he’s a respected DJ also played a part because they had to get someone who could make listeners forget about the whole rape debacle. Having him there was the obvious choice,” a second source said.

But he’s a solid DJ so he has the ability to restore the station’s public image.” Primedia publicity manager, Keagile Makgoba, said: “A process is under way to identify a host for the 94.7 afternoon drive show. “No decision has been taken and we continue to engage positively with several candidates. Once an agreement has been reached we’ll make an announcement.” When contacted by the SunTeam  for a comment, Mo Flava refused to comment.
