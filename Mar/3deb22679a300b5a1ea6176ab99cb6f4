HE was working as a motor mechanic. But in the end, he used the same rope he used to tow cars to hang himself. The 30-year-old man was found dead in his room at K section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, on Thursday morning, 4 March. He was found by a young family member who was on his way to school and saw his key outside the door. He then opened the door to give him the key, but found him hanging from his ceiling rafters and informed the family. The family was still traumatised when the SunTeam visited them. They said they were still confused as they didn’t know what led him to take his own life as he was a quiet person. “He was looking forward to renovating his room two weeks ago. He took all the old furniture away and said he will put floor tiles and buy new furniture,” said a family member. The relative said the man, who had been visiting at his family home in Mandeni, returned to his place in KwaMashu on Wednesday night. “He came at night and got into his empty room, while speaking to the phone. I thought when he is finished, he will come to sleep with me as he doesn’t have furniture, but I ended up falling asleep until the morning,” said the family member. He said in the morning he saw the key outside his door and when he opened the door, he found him dead. He said he didn’t leave a note. But friends and neighbours said the man had been complaining about his baby mama who wanted to dump him. A 67-year-old neighbour said: “Yazi, I just spoke to him two weeks ago. He told me he has problems with the baby mama.” A friend (28) said: “Every time when he was drunk he’d tell us his baby mama has changed since he bought a car. Now their relationship is up and down.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “We can confirm an inquest docket is being investigated by KwaMashu cops after a 30-year-old man was found hanging inside a house at K section in KwaMashu. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.”
