CULTURAL expert Mbuso Khoza said this was the first time in the Zulu nation’s history that the public heard of ukukhothama kweSilo. Khoza said back then, the Zulu royal house hid the news until after Isilo sesitshaliwe to avoid witchcraft and succession wars. Khoza spoke to the People’s Paper after King Goodwill Zwelithini bowed down on Friday, 12 March and the news of ukukhothama kweSilo was announced on the same day. Khoza, who is also a Wits University part-time lecturer on Amahubo, Zulu Culture and Language, told Daily Sun that as per Zulu royal culture, even the king’s grave was hidden to mislead witch doctors. “Zulu culture has many secretive protocols of ukutshalwa kweSilo. He’s planted in the night with a few royal house family members. They will be the only one who know where the king was planted and show the nation the wrong grave,” said Khoza. He said modern times might have changed the royal house’s belief of not announcing ukukhothama kweSilo. When contacted for comment, Prince Mbonisi Zulu of the Zulu royal house said he was not comfortable commenting. “All I can say is that when my father King Bhekuzulu ekhothama in 1968, I was only eight years and don’t know what happened. We will follow royal house protocols of ukutshalwa kweSilo,” he said. Sources inside the royal palace said Isilo sitshalwe on Saturday night, but the royal house announced that Isilo Samabandla Onke sizotshalwa on Wednesday night.
