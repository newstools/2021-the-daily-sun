TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) training ground was turned into a boxing ring on Tuesday following a fierce fist fight between the club's two senior players. An ugly fistic fight ensued between two senior well-build Tshakhuma FC players - Rhulani Manzini and Alfred Ndengane - who tore each other apart in front of everybody. SunSport understands that the brawl started with a bad tackle from Manzini on Ndengane and they apparently started pushing each other in anger. In frustration and humiliation, Ndengane kicked the ball outside play in their training match and an argument ensued, which was hectic where they pushed each other badly. Coach Dylan Kerr jumped from the bench and intervened to cool down the situation, but Daily Sun understands that the 33-year-old Manzini unleashed a powerful punch on Ndengane, which left him with an open gash on the forehead. The 34-year-old Ndengane, who hails from Cape Town, had to be rushed to a local medical centre where he was given stitches to close the open wound. Explains our source: "It was bad. I am not absolutely sure, but we understand that the two players have had an old tiff and did not see eye to eye. Everybody was shocked and we never expected this coming from the two senior players. They should be the ones guiding youngsters and not them fighting. It is now in the hands of management to take action, either discipline the two of them, but first understand was the real course. At first everybody thought it was clash of heads." The club's liaison manager, Rufus Matsena, said he was not aware of the incident of the incidentÂ  but they will investigate.
