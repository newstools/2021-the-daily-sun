 TEMBA Bavuma has been named as the new Proteas captain in the limited overs game.  Dean Elgar will lead the national team’s Test side, Cricket SA announced the duo’s respective appointments on Thursday.  Bavuma will become the first black permanent skipper when he leads the Proteas in the 2021 and 2022 ICC Men’s T20 World Cups as well as the ICC Men’s World Cup in 2023.  The 30-year-old Bavuma replaces Quinton de Kock, who served in the position after Faf du Plessis stepped down as captain early this year.  Bavuma has expressed delight at his appointment, describing it as a dream come true.  “Captaining the Proteas has been a dream of mine for many years as those closest to me would know,” the batsman and Lions captain. “This is one of the greatest honours of my life so far and I am looking forward to picking up where Quinny (de Kock) has left off in leading the team into the new culture that we have developed and continue to work on.”  CSA’s Director of Cricket (DoC), Graeme Smith said: “As CSA are pleased with the appointments of Temba and Dean and believe that we have the men who will lead the Proteas back to their winning ways of old. “The pair bring the required stability in both leadership and form to turn the ship in the direction that will eventually bring trophies back to the cabinets.”  Elgar will take the reins into the next cycle of the ICC World Test Championship.
