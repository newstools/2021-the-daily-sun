ORLANDO Pirates are expected to welcome Thembinkosi Lorch back at training later this week. Undoubtedly, this will be a massive boost for the Buccaneers ahead of their trip to Gqeberha, where they will face Chippa United on Saturday. “Thembinkosi Lorch, who limped off during the Nedbank Cup victory over Maritzburg United after a left adductor strain, is expected to resume training later in the week partially,” the club said in a statement. Recently the Buccaneers welcomed back Gabadinho Mhango and Tshegofatso Mabasa, whom both saw action when Pirates defeated Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 on Tuesday. The club also announced that Terrence Dzvukamanja is scheduled to return to full training next week as he also continues to undergo rehabilitation from an ankle injury. Meanwhile, the club confirmed that striker Zakhele Lepasa continues with rehabilitation on his ankle injury, having been out of action since December, and is also nearing a return. “The medical team has also reported an injury to midfielder Nkanyiso Zungu, who has suffered a right forearm contusion,” statement said.
