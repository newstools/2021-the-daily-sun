Motorists are waiting with bated breath for a decision on e-tolls. With less than 20% paying, government is clutching at straws. An end-of month deadline has been placed on a decision on e-tolls. If Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s stance of “users must pay” is adopted, the ANC could be severely punished at the local government elections later this year. Forcing motorists to comply, by refusing to renew car licences unless their e-tolls are paid up, would be foolish. This may even provoke a tax revolt. And we hope and pray that government does stick to the set deadline this time around. - Letter by Bushy Green, Kagiso
