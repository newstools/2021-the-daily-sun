BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic chief executive, Khumbulani Konco, has quit the club. SunSport understand that Konco will confirm his departure at the financially troubled club on Wednesday. According to our source: "Khumbulani is no longer working for Celtic. He's cleared his desk and will no longer work for the club. I do not have all the details but what I know is that he has quit the club. He will possibly join one of the big clubs in the PSL." This news comes as no surprise as Konco was suspended by club chairman Max Tshabalala last month. This was after heated brawl with Tshabalala which they ultimately resolved amicably weeks later. It is understood at the time Tshabalala spoke to the CEO unpleasantly and he put his foot down and retaliated, which saw the chairman hit him with a suspension. More details will be revealed by Konco on Wednesday. Konco has been the spine of the club amid tension of staff and players at times going without monthly salaries. SunSport reported that staff, which included some of the technical members, received their February salaries late. Celtic will on Saturday visit Baroka FC in their DStv Premiership club at the Peter Mokaba Stadium.
