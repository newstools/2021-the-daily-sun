FORMER co-operative governance minister Des van Rooyen helped a Gupta-linked company get tenders with his department. Former Trillian Management Consulting CEO Bianca Goodson told the Commission yesterday the company received a tender it had not asked for from the department in March 2016. She said it was sent to her by Van Rooyen’s adviser Mohamed Bobat, who worked for Trillian before joining his team when he was appointed finance minister in 2015. Goodson said at the time Trillian had no staff members or history as it was only eight days old. She said she’d get timeline expectations and budget information from Bobat to ensure the company proposals were received favourably. ALSO READ: ACTOR, WIFE CALL IT QUITS! Goodson said before the company received the information, Trillian Capital Partners CEO Eric Wood introduced her to Van Rooyen at his offices. She was taken there with Eskom CFO Anoj Singh and Transnet CFO Garry Pita. Goodson said the minister was with Bobat and his other adviser, Ian Whiley. She said she was never told the purpose of the meeting. Goodson said she asked Clive Angel, then director of Integrated Capital Management, why Trillian didn’t just respond to a request for proposals like other companies, and he told her Bobat was there to open taps for them. Goodson said she resigned on 19 March 2016 when it became clear she was appointed to be used. She was interviewed by Gupta lieutenant Salim Essa, and found the interview interesting as Essa was selling the company to her as opposed to her selling her skills. “I found it a bit bizarre. He said he wanted to help reduce load shedding and help Eskom become a first-world company.”
