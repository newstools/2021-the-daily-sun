FORMER state security minister Bongani Bongo said forces of darkness want to find him guilty at all costs. He said this after he appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrates Court yesterday. Bongo and 10 other people were bust by the Hawks in October for fraud and corruption in connection with land deals amounting to R124 million. A complaint was allegedly made about Msukaligwa Municipality, which allegedly bought Rietspruit Farm in Ermelo worth R11 million and sold it for about R36,4 million to develop a township. This is despite the municipality owning a farm that could’ve been used for the same purpose. Bongo said the Hawks should have been done with the investigations 11 years ago. He said nothing was being said about the trial and the NPA had not been ready to try this matter. “My only conclusion will be that this is done for political reasons to drag my name through the mud. “I want to reiterate that I’m not corrupt and neither is anyone in my family. I have proven this in court in the Western Cape and will prove in court here.” He said the issue of him stepping aside was being discussed by the ANC. Prosecutor Henry Nxumalo said the docket was available, but an analysis was still to be made and expected to be concluded by 26 March. He said the state was ready to move the case to the regional court. Magistrate Susan Monaledi postponed the matter to 4 May.
