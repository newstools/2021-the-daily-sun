A 47-YEAR-OLD man will appear before the Durban Magistrates Court on charges of fraud and possession of stolen property. He was arrested after an intelligence-driven operation that was conducted on Saturday morning. Cops ambushed the suspect, who was withdrawing cash from different Sassa cards at an ATM on Anton Lembede Street. The suspect was driving a white Mercedes-Benz GT that he had recently bought. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said 70 Sassa cards were seized from the suspect and an amount of R7 640 recovered.  “His vehicle was also seized by police. Further investigation conducted by the team led them to the suspect’s residence in Umhlanga, where a USB stick was found after being thrown own of the window. It was seized for further investigation. The suspect was placed under arrest for fraud and possession of stolen property,” Gwala said. “I am pleased with the arrest of the fraudster and seizure of Sassa cards. It is heart-breaking to learn that there are people who rob our citizens. They wait anxiously for their money, only to be disappointed when it is not paid into their accounts,” said acting provincial Commissioner for KwaZulu-Natal Major General Thulani Gonya.
