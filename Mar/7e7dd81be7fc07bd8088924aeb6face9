AFTER talks on social media about the National Arts Council taking action against corrupt officials who misused R300 million meant for struggling artists, spokesman Tshepo Mashiane has labelled that as fake news. Over the weekend, there was a tweet that claimed the arts council would take action against corrupt officials. Mashiane has rubbished those claims. The tweet read: “The National Arts Council is taking action against officials who misused R300 million set aside to help struggling artists during the pandemic. “Arthur Mafokate and his family allegedly received over R10 million from the relief fund. Soul sickness eating deeper into our society.” ALSO READ | AKA PAYS LOBOLA FOR NELLI Mashiane told Daily Sun no R300 million from the council was misused. “There’s no process of the council intending to suspend any officials. No money has disappeared,” he said. “As it is, the council has distributed over R56 million and there’s still R210 million in the account of the NAC.” Mashiane said they’d like to encourage creatives to apply before the end of March. “Every time we get an opportunity to speak to the media, we’d like to ask those who’ve applied to submit their applications as soon as possible. We want to make sure this money is with them, come 31 March,” he said. There are also creatives who’ve also been protesting at the NAC offices for the past month, demanding to see the list of names of everyone who benefitted from the R300 million. The council met with the creatives on Wednesday, 24 March and again on Friday, 26 March. Mashiane said the meetings went well. “The council usually has a meeting every Friday and the creatives joined us last week,’’ he said. “We had an engagement with them to keep them updated with what’s been happening, to date.”
