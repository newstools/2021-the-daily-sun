A duo was arrested on Monday and is expected to appear in
court this morning. The suspects aged 38 and 39 are charged with illegal
possession and transportation of rhino horn. Speaking to Daily Sun, cop spokesman Captain Ndivhuwo
Mulamu said K9 cops from Benoni followed up on intelligence regarding a
planned illegal rhino horn sale in the area. "Police intercepted the positively identified suspect's
vehicle on Lionel Street in Benoni. Upon searching the vehicle, police found a
sizable rhino horn concealed in a plastic bag inside the boot," he said. Mulamu said a luxurious White Mercedes Benz used in the
commission of the crime was also confiscated for further investigation. "The matter was referred to the Hawks’ Serious
Organised Crime Investigation in Germiston for further investigation," he
said. Meanwhile, almost 400 rhinos were poached in South
Africa last year. This is according to the latest figures reported by
South Africa’s Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries.
