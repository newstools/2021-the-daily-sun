RECYCLERS from Mushroom squatter camp will soon lose their shacks. The City of Tshwane has a court order to demolish the plastic shacks. Residents said living in the area changed their lives as they could collect recycling material around Centurion and sell it for a living. Berenice Mtika (60) told Daily Sun her life depended on recycling. She said her blood pressure went up after she heard the city would evict them. “I haven’t been eating or sleeping. The city must find a place where we’ll continue to collect recycling material without fighting with other recyclers,” she said. They moved into the area in 2014. Matshabiseng Legadiko (41) said: “This is a special place. It gives us life.” Isaac Tau (54) said the city should leave them alone because the place was abandoned for years. The dad of two said the area was not far from where he collected recycling. “We can’t fight them, but we’re begging the city to give us another chance so we can feed our families,” he said. Tshwane acting chief of staff, Jordan Griffiths, said the recyclers lived on private land, which they invaded. He said the property owner received an eviction order from the court. “The court says the city has to relocate the occupants to Sunderland Ridge,” he said.
