 Mzansi was
left shocked by a prison poke between an inmate and a prison warder. This over a
video that has been doing the rounds on social media since last night, leaving
many wondering why the warder would even allow this short-lived pleasure to be
filmed. “So, this
woman messed up her career for something that didn’t even last for 10 minutes?
Didn't she see the prisoner turning his camera on?” Nathi Tweeted. Munyai
Gondo said he was shocked and didn't understand why they would take a video of
a little six minutes of pleasure. “Imagine
losing a job during this pandemic. Getting a job is like reversing your
virginity. Imagine losing it just because you were chowed by a prisoner. Just
imagine. This is embarrassing, to say the least, shame,” he said. “Please
spare a thought for people who will be affected by the actions of this warden.
I pray and hope that she doesn’t have children or a husband,” Dlambulo tweeted. KZN
Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said the department would
take strong action against the official for the alleged coitus act with an
inmate. Nxumalo
added that this took place at the Ncome Correctional Centre in KwaZulu-Natal
region, and left the Department of Correctional Services appalled, embarrassed
and gutted. “Sexual
activities between inmates and correctional officials are shameful. These
incidents can never be ascribed to what is expected of our officials,” said
Nxumalo. The officer
involved has been identified and will be subjected to a disciplinary process with
immediate effect. Disciplinary measures have also been instituted against the
inmate. “Correctional
officials are expected to abide by a code of conduct, and despicable acts of
sexual activities with inmates shall never be tolerated,” said Nxumalo. “We appeal
to those in possession of the video to refrain from disseminating it,” he
pleaded.
