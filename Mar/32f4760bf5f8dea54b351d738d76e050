Some rich guy once said something about making money while you sleep, and 80 000 Phuthuma Nathi shareholders did just that. Even amidst the success, there are still 22 000 South Africans who are yet to claim their share of R207 million. Chair of Phuthuma Nathi, Mandla Langa said, “This money belongs to our shareholders. We are calling on them to contact us to get their money. If you know of a family member who owned shares, ask them to contact us. In these tough economic times, we want to do everything in our power to give our shareholders what is rightfully theirs,” A lot can happen in 1 or even 14 years, even a pandemic, and this may have resulted in some unexpected changes. Below are the reasons that shareholders have yet to collect their dividends: If you have invested in Phuthuma Nathi between 2006 and 2020 and the above-mentioned applies to you, your family, or somebody that you know should urgently take action and contact the Phuthuma Nathi call centre on 086 011 6226, send an email to phuthumanathi@singular.co.za or visit the Phuthuma Nathi website at www.phuthumanathi.co.za and claim your share of millions.
