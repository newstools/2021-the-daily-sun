SHE saw a man in Limpopo convert animal and human waste into energy to generate power. This inspired media personality Ntombee Mzolo (37) to venture into renewable energy. “I was touched when I saw how this man was changing people’s lives by giving them power,” she said. “They will cook and switch on the lights with ease.” Ntombee has now partnered with Invest Solar and is ready to change people’s lives. “I will also encourage consumers to go off the grid,” she told the People’s Paper. “I want them to solely rely on energy generated from the sun through a household solar and battery storage system. “There will be no more worries about high electricity bills and load shedding will be a thing of the past.” Ntombee said she’s hands on and people will even see her onsite with technicians installing solar panels and inverters at different buildings. She said people could start with a 800-watt inverter, lead acid battery and a Canadian solar panel and can upgrade later. She was last heard on radio in April. After radio, Ntombee went back to TV and was a stand-in presenter on shows such as Uyajola 99, Umphakathi and Uthando Noxolo on Moja Love. She presents the show Lekunutu, also on Moja Love.
