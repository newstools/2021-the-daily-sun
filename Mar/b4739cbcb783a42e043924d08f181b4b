BAFANA Bafana star Percy Tau has opened up about his struggle for game time at English Premiership side Brighton and Hove Albion. The former Mamelodi Sundowns star was recently recalled from his loan spell at Belgian outfit Anderlecht but has found game time hard to come by in England. Tau has featured only five times for the Seagulls since his return and is yet to make his mark in the team. The 26-year-old has spent the better part of his time on the bench at Brighton, patiently waiting for his opportunity. This, however, has not deterred Tau who insists that this is just another challenge that he will rise above. “I think the situation is not as bad as it could be,” said a positive Tau. “I have not had as many opportunities to play but I keep fighting for a position in the team. This is not easy when the team is doing well, and the guys are playing well. “You just have to keep a positive attitude, it’s not easy because you think maybe you might get an opportunity next week and it doesn’t happen and the week after that as well. “But I know that I will be ready whenever I am called upon. That is my situation at the moment but its football. “I think in life and football there are a lot of challenges. I am where I am today because I have taken some of those challenges that have been put in front of me. “The outcome has been good on my side so far, so I will keep fighting and trying to get into the team.”
