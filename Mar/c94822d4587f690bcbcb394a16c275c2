BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has received a major boost ahead of their crunch Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers this week. The coach will be able to call upon talismanic forward Percy Tau after he arrived in the country to join the squad on Monday. Tau was given the clear to travel to Mzansi by his English Premiership side Brighton and Hove Albion. The former Mamelodi Sundowns star is one of several overseas-based players who were in doubt for Bafana. This as their clubs were reluctant to release them because they would have to quarantine for 14 days upon their return from national duty. As a result, some of these players would miss at least three matches for their clubs when they return. The likes of Tau, Bongani Zungu, Dean Furman, Lyle Foster, Luther Singh, Thibang Phete, Thulani Serero Siyanda Xulu and Keagan Dolly are all affected. But the arrival of Tau as well as that of striker Foster has been a welcome boost for Ntseki. They resume their journey to qualify for the Afcon in Cameroon with a clash against Ghana at FNB Stadium on Thursday before they travel to Sudan for another crunch match on Sunday. “We were all looking forward to having all our best players available but the situation at the moment means that might not happen,” said Ntseki. “But we do have Percy, he just arrived here and we also have Lyle who has also been able to join the squad. “We are still negotiating for others and hopefully if they can't join us for Ghana they will be able to be with us in Sudan. “The situation is especially tough for the players because they want to be here but at the same time, they don’t want to risk their livelihoods abroad. “I had to make the players who could not be with us understand that the rest of the squad will do it for them. “They will qualify for the Afcon for them and they will be available for selection going into the next qualifiers for the World Cup.”
