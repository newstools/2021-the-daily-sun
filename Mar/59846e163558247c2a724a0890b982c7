STRUGGLING Black Leopards assistant coach Lehlohonolo Seema is pleased with his side's 1-1 draw against high-flying Mamelodi Sundowns in their DStv Premiership clash at Loftus Versfeld on Sunday. Bottom side Leopards came to this clash with many football fans expecting the Venda-based-side to be squashed by the 10-times PSL champions. But Seema's lads put a good fight to earn a point. The on-form Brazilians are leading on the log with 40 points from 18 league matches. And so far, Downs are the only team that is still to lose a league game. "It's not any team that can get a point or point at Sundowns," said Seema, who is in charge of the Leopards while their new coach Kosta Papic is still waiting for a work permit. "We went to Sundowns with one goal of getting something. I am happy with a point we came back with. We never wanted to play good football but we needed a point and we got it. It was a tough game but we knew that if we keep our shape we will frustrate them and we will end up getting chances and score." Seema has also welcome the two weeks Fifa break as it will help his lads to recharge for their next league clash against Benni McCarthy's AmaZulu at Thohoyandou Stadium on the 4th of April. "I think this break came at the right time for us," said the former Bloemfontein Celtic and Chippa United coach. "We have guys who have been recovering from knocks and we are expecting them to be back after this break. I think the boys will come back fresher and ready to fight to help this club move from the position we are." Seema also revealed that their defender Sibusiso Khumalo's injury he suffered on Sunday was not that serious. "It looked serious but we came back home with him and he is ok," said Seema. "I am hoping that he will be available in our next game. I am happy for him as his injury is not serious. He is an experienced player and we need him this time." Downs goal was scored by Musa Lebusa while Roderick Kabwe netted for Leopards.
