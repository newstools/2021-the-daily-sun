THE ANC’s NEC has reached a deadlock over calls for secretary-general Ace Magashule to step aside. According to reports, the meeting on Sunday, 28 March was chaotic and members were divided along factional lines. The meeting was set to convene again last night after Magashule’s supporters pushed against the step-aside rule stating a member charged with a serious crime must vacate their position. Party spokesman Pule Mabe confirmed the virtual meeting was due to reconvene. He couldn’t confirm the deadlock but hinted that the step-aside rule was discussed, despite not being on the agenda. Daily Sun understands the divide was 50-50. “The narrative that the majority of members were in favour of the step-aside rule is not true. When I counted the numbers it was a 50-50,” said one member. The meeting apparently became chaotic after Magashule supporters insisted if he had to step aside, President Cyril Ramaphosa should also step aside as his election campaign is under investigation. Some members were removed from the virtual meeting for being disruptive. It’s rumoured that Magashule supporters threatened to resign. Magashule insists has refused to step aside, saying he can only be removed by the branches. He is supported by the MK Military Veterans’ Association.  Spokesman Carl Niehaus said the secretary general was democratically elected at a national conference. It was not clear whether the party top six had met to discuss the issue as Ramaphosa and deputy president David Mabuza were in the Eastern Cape to visit a firm manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines. The guidelines were presented to the NEC by former ANC treasurer-general Mathews Phosa and former president Kgalema Montlathe, at the instruction of the top six.
