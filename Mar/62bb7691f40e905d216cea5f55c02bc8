THEY trusted him with their money as he’s a man of God, but he broke their trust when he allegedly made off with it. This after they invested in Pastor Elias Koloko’s Let’s Prosper Traders in January last year. The victims, who borrowed money to invest, said they never believed a man of God would scam them. Kutlwano Matlou (31) told Daily Sun she invested over R400 000 and was promised millions in return. She said the pastor left Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, to live in Silverlakes, east of Tshwane, but they can’t seem to find him anywhere. “We were supposed to get the first payment on 1 October,” said Kutlwano, who sold her camera to invest. “But we haven’t been paid because he keeps saying they have backlogs, the authorities were investigating them, and their bank accounts were closed.”     Gugulethu Mvalo (37) said she was owed R250 000. “I invested R50 000 and was promised R150 000 in October. I’m very angry,” she said. “I had a bad Christmas because we didn’t have money or food. I borrowed money from a mashonisa and now I’m in debt.” Pertunia Hamane (50) invested R90 000 in October and should have been paid in January. “Some people gave me R50 000 to invest for them,” said Pertunia. “I promised them we’d get R290 000 in returns. I’ve lost everything and it’s painful.” Beauty Molefe (44) said a friend introduced her to this man of God.  “I’ve lost my R200 000 investment. I was promised R850 000 in returns, but I’ve lost all my money,” she said. Daily Sun tried to contact the pastor, but his phone rang unanswered. His other number was off. Messages the People’s Paper sent to him were not responded to. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo advised the victims to open cases with the police.
