BAROKA coach Thoka Matsimela is keeping his fingers crossed that all his foreign players return from their respective national duties injury-free. Baroka had five players who were called up to play for their different countries during this Fifa international break. They are Gerald Phiri, Richard Mbulu from Malawi, Manuel Kampala of Mozambique, Ananias Gebhardt and Joslin Kamatuka from Namibia. Baroka also had two of their youngsters Goodman Models and Evidence Makgopa who were called up for the South Africa Under-23 camp that was held in Durban. Matsimela is expecting all the players to join the team tomorrow to prepare for their DStv Premiership clash against Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. “We are at an important stage of the season and need all our players,” said Matsimela. “We have many players who went away with their national teams. We love it and are proud when our players are called to their national teams, but we are praying they return free of injuries. “The other challenge is that we have a worldwide coronavirus pandemic and hope they come back uninfected.” The Limpopo-based side are 11th on the log with 22 points from 20 games and Matsimela has made it clear that he wants to make history by guiding Baroka to a top eight finish. “We do not want to fight for relegation like in the previous seasons,” said Thoka, who is in his debut season as a coach in the top flight. “We already have (goalkeeper) Elvis Chipezeze out on suspension which is a huge setback. “So, we cannot afford to miss any more players. It will be a dream come true and an achievement to be the first coach to lead Baroka to top eight finish at the end of the season.”
