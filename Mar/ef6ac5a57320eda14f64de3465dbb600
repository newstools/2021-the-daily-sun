MORE people in the North West are ready for the Covid-19 vaccine. The province is standing at over 35 000 registered people awaiting to get the jab. Bojanala area, which is a hotspot, has 14 347 registered people, while Dr Kenneth Kaunda district has more than 10 000 registrations. Ngaka Modiri Molema and Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati areas have less than 5 000 registrations each. Due to the high number of non-healthcare worker registrations, community vaccinations are next. The health department has increased more vaccination sites from two to five. The first two sites used were Job Shimankana Tabane Hospital in Rustenburg and Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp. The province has a total of 43 vaccination sites, which will open as numbers continue to grow. It also received its second batch of Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses amounting to 2 600, while a further 2 760 is expected to be delivered in the coming week. Health MEC Madoda Sambatha said registrations were progressing well. “We’ve now added Moses Kotane, Life Peglerae and Mahikeng Provincial Hospitals, making our vaccination sites five. Many of our vaccination sites are ready. We will activate them as and when vaccines are delivered,” he said. The registration is easy. Residents register at a Covid-19 registration site, get a voucher number, sign a consent form and then get vaccinated. After vaccination, people are observed for 15 minutes and then released. Frontline healthcare worker Motlalepule Ramafoko registered for the jab. “I decided to be vaccinated because I understand that vaccines promote immunity. When you’re immunised, chances of contracting a severe illness are low. “I was immunised and have never experienced any reaction,” said Motlalepula.
