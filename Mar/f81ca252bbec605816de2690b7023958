THE Zulu monarch’s traditional prime minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has revealed that tension and squabbles have started in the royal family following the death of King Goodwill Zwelithini. The king died of diabetes on Friday, and the royal family said he’d also contracted Covid-19 in hospital. Addressing mourners, princes and traditional leaders on Saturday, Buthelezi almost cried when he revealed the royal family did not respect him and his position as prime minister. Buthelezi said when they were taking the king’s remains from Durban to Nongoma, he agreed with his wives the body would go straight to the local mortuary. “Big homes always have many squabbles. As much as we’d agreed, on our way to Nongoma I heard that some of the princesses and princes had changed plans behind my back. It’s known that the king died during a bad time. “It’s also known that the king had Covid-19. They wanted the remains to go to all royal places like Ondini, Osuthu, Enyokeni, KwaDlamahlahla, Linduzulu and Khethomthandayo before being kept in the local mortuary.” Buthelezi said he was hurt and had to call Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and Police Minister Bheki Cele to stop the royal house from breaking Covid-19 regulations. “I told the ministers and royal house I’d not go there if they continued taking the king’s remains and ignoring my decisions. Mkhize asked me to calm down,” he said. “You’re seeing me here because of Mkhize, who intervened because I’d decided not to come. I don’t want my name to be mentioned when the nation dies. “Cele said it would look like he was meddling in family matters if he intervened. Even now, I’m not sure if the body is being taken as that of a person with Covid-19.” Buthelezi said he decided to let the nation know how difficult his work was when doing his duties as royal prime minister.
