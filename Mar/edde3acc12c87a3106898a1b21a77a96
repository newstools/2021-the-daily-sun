A MOTHER from Mfuleni has left behind a three-day-old baby after she was hit by a stray bullet inside her shack on Sunday afternoon, 28 March. Zandile Phuka (35) was hit in the head after a bullet pierced through her shack in Iligwa Street extension 6. This allegedly happened when gunmen fired shots and killed people at a nearby tavern. She was found in a pool of blood by her husband’s sister, who’d come to see the newborn. She was rushed to Site B Day Hospital but died on arrival. Her husband Buntu Vara (37) said Zandile delivered their son on Friday, 26 March. “I went to work at about 12pm, but an hour later I got a call that my wife had been shot,” he said. “When I arrived home she’d already been taken to hospital. Unfortunately, she died before I could see her.” Buntu’s father, Alexander Dastile (65), said: “We’e in pain. We’d hoped to celebrate the arrival of the new baby together with our makoti. Her death came as a surprise.” Buntu showed the SunTeam the bullet hole in his shack. Cops confirmed the shooting that took place at a tavern on Sunday afternoon, where people were killed. However, they couldn’t confirm the incident of the woman hit by a stray bullet. Colonel Andre Traut said: “Three males aged 32, 39 and one of an unknown age were shot and killed on Iligwa Street extension 6, Mfuleni, at about 1.30pm on Sunday afternoon. “A fourth victim sustained a gunshot wound and is in hospital. Four suspects fled and are yet to be arrested.” In a separate incident, a 29-year-old man was shot and killed on Shire Street extension 6 in Mfuleni at about 18.30pm on Sunday by unknown suspects, who’re yet to be arrested.
