SWALLOWS FC boss David Mogashoa surely knows his way around the kitchen. Even though, he is well known for enjoying his Nandos chicken with coach Brandon Truter, Mogashoa also enjoys homemade fat cakes, so much so that he doesn’t need any visitors whenever he’s cooked the delicacy. Mogashoa is known to interact a lot with Swallows fans on social media and he showed a pic of his magwenya boiling in a pool of oil.  Whether The Birds players will have Amagwinya as part of their breakfast remains to be seen.
