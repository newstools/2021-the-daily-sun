HUNDREDS of people were left homeless after a storm caused severe damage in Mjindini and Barberton, Mpumalanga on Thursday night. Some houses collapsed while others had their roofs blown away by the strong winds. City of Mbombela Municipality spokesman Joseph Ngala said no injuries have been confirmed as yet.  He said the most affected areas were extensions 16 and 17 as well as Mjindini Trust. “Relief has been provided. Assessment is still underway. The Department of Human Settlements will also be approached as most of the affected households are RDP houses,” he said.
