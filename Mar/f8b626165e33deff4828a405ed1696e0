I’ll bring fireworks because it’s going to be authentic. “People can expect to laugh and have real conversations with me. I will be their friend on the airwaves.” Thando said she was under no pressure to fill someone else’s shoes. “I can’t wait to get behind the mic with my co-host Alex Craige, who I met a few weeks back. He’s a great guy and I can’t wait for us to create magic together,” she said. Thando, who will be taking over from her best friend Mantsoe Pout, said there were no hard feelings. “She was really excited for me and we had a long conversation about it, like best friends should,” she said.
