EFF Leader Julius Malema has used his visit to Mthokozisi Ntumba’s home to highlight the different treatment by police towards black and white people.During protests by black people, police have often been seen using force when they deal with the crowds but with white people the approach would be different. Malema said the South African police have got no respect for the black people. “Police have no respect for black people, because Bheki Cele speaks to black people like he’s speaking to his children.’ “But when he speaks to white people, he’s being nice and accommodating.” #JuliusMalema says police have got no respect for black people. He says Bheki Cele was nice to white beach goers without masks in Cape Town but ordered an arrest of a young black man without a mask at at taxi rank in KwaMashu. #witsprotest pic.twitter.com/51RgJHmBr5  Malema added, “he found some white people in some beach there in Cape Town, without masks, he said to them you don’t like masks? “And then he found a young man (without a mask) at a taxi rank in KwaMashu, he said ‘Bophani lomfana’ (arrest this boy).” He said the young black man wasn’t forward and had the opportunity to answer if he liked the mask or not. MENZI NGUBANE HASS PASSED ON! Malema also made reference to the situation in Senekal where not a single rubber bullet was fired when angry residents damaged the court building. He said police take selfies with white people but shoot rubber bullets at black people. He said the EFF will file an application to the constitutional court, to have the use of rubber bullets declared unlawful.
