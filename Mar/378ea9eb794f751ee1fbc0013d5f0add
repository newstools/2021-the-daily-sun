THEY say beauty is pain – and priceless. But I’m sure that even the most expensive beauty brands in the world have a price tag, right? Let’s take cutting your hair as an example. If you, like me, are a chiskop type of being, then you can pay anything from R10 to R100. However, if you are team fade or if you like special haircuts, then you can pay anything from R100 to R700. If you think these numbers are pricey, then you obviously haven’t seen the world’s most expensive haircut. According to the Guinness World Records, the most expensive haircut cost £8 000 (R160 000) and was done by Stuart Phillips at the Stuart Phillips Salon in Covent Garden, London, UK, on 29 October 2007. The person who made the appointment was Beverley Lateo of Pisa in Italy, who could not find a hairdresser that she liked in the whole of Italy. She then looked elsewhere in Europe and in April 2007, found Stuart Phillips. She recognised the salon from numerous British magazines as the official hairstylist to the British Academy Television Awards. A month later she was having her long layers cut by Stuart as part of his International VIP hair service. The cut was seemingly worth every penny, and Beverley is booked in for another appointment. The record-breaking haircut package included a Champagne lunch, a head and scalp massage, a selection of personalised L’Oreal hair products and treatments, a return limousine ride from the airport, and of course, the haircutting skills of Stuart Phillips himself.
