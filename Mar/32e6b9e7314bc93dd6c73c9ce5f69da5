CHURCH in Zion leader Reverend Zama Mfihlo has called on government to consider pastors as frontline workers and prioritise them for vaccination. He said pastors work with people, including conducting burials of those who have died of Covid-19. Mfihlo said pastors were exposed to the virus more than other people but government had not done much to recognise them. “We are the ones who bury people. Even those who die of Covid-19. We do counselling for those who lost their loved ones and my worry is that we are not considered as front- line workers. We hope that will be corrected,” he said. The reverend said he was not undermining traditional doctors, but they were exposed to the virus less than pastors, especially those who worked with the families of people who died of Covid-19. Mzimasi Qwebe (51), a church leader from Langa in Cape Town, told Daily Sun he had helped many families bury loved ones since the pandemic started. “Families cannot bury their loved ones without a pastor officiating and praying at funerals. Even if a person dies of Covid-19, they still want a pastor to pray for them. This shows how critical our services are to the community, yet we are not regarded as essential workers who should be prioritised,” said Qwebe. Meanwhile, the Department of Health stated that it is catering only for healthcare workers in the first phase of vaccination. The department said it was aiming to vaccinate 67% of the population by the end of this year, which will allow the country to achieve herd immunity. The department said Phase 1 would focus only on frontline healthcare workers, Phase 2 would cover essential workers, persons in congregate settings, persons over 60 years and persons over 18 years with co-morbidities.
