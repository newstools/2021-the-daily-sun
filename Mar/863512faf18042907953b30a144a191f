THE CAF Emergency Committee have decided to scrap the U-17 Total Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). "The Committee was made aware of the constraints faced by some of the participating member associations, as well as the host country including the fact that the coronavirus pandemic continues to present significant challenges for the organisation of international sporting events," these were reasons given by CAF following their emergency meeting in Rabat, Morocco on Monday. Taking into account the cancellation by Fifa of the U-17 World Cup for which the U-17 Afcon was no longer qualifying, the Committee further noted: • The resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic. • Increased restrictions on international travel. • Uncertainty about the evolution of the situation. "For all these reasons, the Committee decided to cancel the 2021 edition of the U-17 Afcon," said Caf in a statement. The tournament was scheduled to start this weekend until 31 March, but last minute changes forced the confederation to make quick changes. South African U-17 side, under coach Vela Khumalo, were favourites to win this one following preparations that started last year, having failed to qualify in 2017 and finished as runners in 2015. Among countries that qualified for the tournament includes: Morocco (hosts), Algeria, Senegal, Mali, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Uganda, Cameroon, Congo, South Africa and Zambia.
