KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt says they are now fighting for a top eight finish. Chiefs boosted their top eight chances when they beat Orlando Pirates 1-0 in the DStv Premiership Soweto derby at FNB Stadium on Sunday. Samir Nurkovic scored the crucial goal that helped Amakhosi jump to ninth place on the table. Hunt, who has struggled to get positive results since he took charge at the start of the season, was happy with the victory which ends a run of six league games without a win. The former Bidvest Wits coach has been tasked by Chiefs management to finish in the top eight and do well in the group stages of the Caf Champions League. “We got to get there (finish in the top eight),” said Hunt. “Yes, it is going to be a big task. But once we get this programme, travelling around Africa (out of the way) we can obviously try and focus on it. We have big games coming up against teams around us and beneath us. Now, we have a bit of a run going with a couple of games unbeaten. But we need to turn the draws into victories.” To finally get one over Pirates this season after losing the first three games against Bucs, Hunt said his charges were tactically superior in closing the spaces to nullify Josef Zinnbauer’s side. Defensively, with Eric Mathoho and Daniel Cardoso marshalling the back four, Chiefs were strong and unshaken by whatever their Soweto rivals were trying to do. “The most important thing was we defended better. The shape was better,” said Hunt. “We worked on it in at training. We were more disciplined and patient. These are the things we work on daily.” After the Fifa international break, Chiefs will host Moroccan giants Wydad Athletic in the Champions League at FNB Stadium on 3 April.
