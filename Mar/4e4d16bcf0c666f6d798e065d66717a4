WITH winter just around the corner, kids at Mkhanyo Primary School are already freezing. The windows are broken and when there are storms water streams in. Parents at the school in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, say they’re very worried their kids will get sick. Induna Jacob Chillie told Daily Sun he fixed the windows just three years ago with glass which he paid for. “I’m shocked the school is failing to fix the broken windows when I did it with my own money three years ago,” he said. “Kids are freezing cold and lose concentration in class. “They’ll catch a cold and get sick. The rains haven’t stopped yet. “Every time something has to be fixed parents have to fight for it. “This situation disrupts teaching and learning.” Makhosazana Sikhosana (35) said when kids fall ill they’ll have to take time off to go to the clinic. “This is not the time for our kids to fall behind on their schoolwork. They need to learn in a proper environment,” she said. “My child is sneezing and coughing. I have to spend money on medication. The windows must be fixed soon.” Sipho Masango (47) told the SunTeam the desks get wet when it’s raining. “Every day when the kids come to school, they have to wipe water drops off their desks,” he said. “The desks are also cold because of the water.” Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the SGB would be instructed to fix the windows using the school’s maintenance allocation from the department.
