Al Ahly will take on AS Vita Club in the CAF Champions League Group A match at the Cairo International Stadium in Egypt on Saturday (9pm). The Egyptian champions suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat to Tanzanian giants Simba SC away in their previous group stage match on 23 February. The defeat left Al Ahly placed third on the Group A standings - three points behind leaders Simba as the teams vie for the two spots available in the knockout phase. Sami Komsan, the Al Ahly assistant coach, stressed the importance of their clash with Vita Club following their recent 2-1 win over El Geish in the Egyptian Premier League game. “We are working on correcting the mistakes and improving the team’s performance," Komsan told the club's official website. “The game against AS Vita Club is very important and we are determined to achieve the victory. We faced these circumstances before and we managed to overcome them.” “I would like to thank Al Ahly fans for their constant support to the team." Meanwhile, Vita Club secured their first win in the group stage when they hammered Sudanese champions 4-1 away on 23 February. As a result, the DR Congolese giants are placed second on the Group A standings - three points behind leaders Simba with four games left. Florent Ibenge, the Vita Club head coach, has fired a warning to Al Ahly as he believes that his side has what it takes to defeat the reigning African champions. "I'm not afraid of Al Ahly, [they] are favourites but we will give the best of ourselves," Ibenge said on Sport New Africa. "Favourites? Yes, but the Black Dolphins haven't said their last word yet. In our two back to matches, we will have our say, "We don't want to let ourselves be dictated by Al Ahly. We will play to score." Al Ahly and Vita Club have met twice in the Champions League since 2019 and both teams recorded a win each. -Supersport.com
