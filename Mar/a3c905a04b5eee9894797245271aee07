A 
Northern Cape traffic officer and a driving school instructor were 
arrested after allegedly accepting a R3 500 bribe for a driver's licence
 during a sting operation by the Hawks. Moatlhodi Nthutang, 59, 
was granted R2 000 bail after he appeared in the Jan Kempdorp 
Magistrate's Court on Friday after he was arrested on Thursday on 
corruption charges. "It is alleged that the traffic official 
employed at Jan Kemdorp Traffic Department and the driving instructor 
demanded a gratification of R3 500 from a complainant in exchange for 
(the) awarding of a driver's licence," said Northern Cape Hawks 
spokesperson Nomthandazo Mnisi. Mnisi said that both men were arrested after accepting the same amount of money during the sting operation. Nthutang's
 co-accused did not appear beside him as he was admitted to hospital 
shortly after his arrest. It is unclear what condition he is being 
treated for. Both men will be back in court on 21 April. News24
