AFTER months of fighting with Eskom to return their transformer, residents of of Winterveldt in Tshwane will finally have electricity. They approached Daily Sun in February after buying it with their own money, only for it to be confiscated by the power utility and police. Police apparently suspected the transformer had been stolen. Speaking to the SunTeam in February, residents said their transformer was seized in October. Domenic Tolo (39) said after spending months raising funds, their excitement was short-lived. “We were shocked when police and Eskom officials came and took our transformer before we could even have it installed,” she said. Domenic said Eskom had told them the transformer might be stolen and did an investigation, which cleared them of wrongdoing. “We were told a tip-off they got was false, but police still refused to return our transformer,” she said. She said the transformer had been gathering dust at the Loate cop shop. “About 70 households made donations yet we were still in the dark,” she said. Residents were told on Wednesday, 17 March they could fetch the transformer. Vusi Msimango (33) said: “Because the transformer stayed there for a long time, it’s no longer in good shape. We’ll need to spend more money to have it fixed.” Saki Ntlokwana was grateful to the SunTeam for helping the community. “When we came to the People’s Paper, we’d lost all hope of getting it back,” said Saki. “But you helped us and we’re now one step closer to having the electricity in the area restored.”
