HER life has become difficult since she lost her brother to Covid-19. This is because she and her brother managed family matters together. He’s now gone and things are tough for the 42-year-old woman from Brakpan in Ekurhuleni. She told Daily Sun she buried her brother, who left behind three kids, last week. She said she cared for the kids as well as her 72-year-old mum, who’s been sick for a while. “The kids’ mother died in 2019 and her family isn’t present in their lives,” she said. The woman said she’s two kids of her own, so life has gone from bad to worse. “He used to do almost everything in the house. All I had to do was buy food for the kids’ lunch boxes,” she said. “He paid for everything else and that’s how we managed to live.” She said she worked three days in a week and sold amagwinya on her off days. “My brother has only been gone for a week and I’m already feeling so much pressure,” she said. “He worked for a certain dealership in Joburg. He didn’t make a lot of money but took care of us with whatever he earned.” The woman said she now had to do everything with the little she made. “Kids need lunch for school. He passed away before he could do groceries and pay for electricity. I already owe a mashonisa,” she said. She said her sister, who lives in Mpumalanga, promised to help even though she doesn’t work full time. “She’s married and has her own problems to worry about. “I really hope I get a better job because life is about to get harder than it already is,” she said. Her best friend (39) also tries to help wherever she can. “I can only help her with a few things like toiletries as I work at a retail store, but that’s how far I can go. I hope she finds help or a better job,” said the friend.
