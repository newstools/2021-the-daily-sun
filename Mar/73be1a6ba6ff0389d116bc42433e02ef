THE SA Netball selectors have been forced to make changes to the Spar Proteas squad that will play the Tri-National series in Cape Town from 25-31 March. The series was initially pencilled in for January, but it was postponed due to a resurgence in Covid-19 cases. Seven key players; Karla Pretorius‚ Shadine van der Merwe‚ Phumza Maweni, Lenize Potgieter, Sigi Burger‚ Ine-Mari Venter, and Lefebre Rademan are no longer available. However, 27 players were invited to a training camp in Stellenbosch between the 15 - 18th of March. From these 27 players, 12 were selected for the SPAR Proteas and 15 for the President’s XII. “The Tri Nations between Uganda and Namibia is very important for us as a team, and it will help us get ready for the ultimate goal which is a podium finish at the 2023 Netball World Cup,” says Netball SA Director of Selections Mpumi Javu.
