THE situation is allegedly tense at Ukhozi FM after Sbongi Ngcobo was appointed business manager. It’s alleged some DJs are unhappy about her management style, so they called the SABC’s top management to a meeting. According to reports by KZN’s regional newspaper on Friday, 19 March, top managers Madoda Mxakwe and Nada Wotshela met with the three popular DJs at a hotel in Durban this week. Sources said the DJs wanted the SABC to review their decision to appoint Sbongi as manager. “You’ll remember that Sbongi has been acting in this position for two years now,” said the source. “The staff were praying she’d not be appointed because they’re unhappy with her. “They believe she’ll missuse her powers to victimise them. That’s why they asked management to intervene.” ALSO READ |TENSION RUN HIGH AT UKHOZI It’s alleged Sbongi is in Joburg, where her matter is being dealt with. “It’s tense at the station.
