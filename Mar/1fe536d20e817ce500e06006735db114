TRAFFIC cops had to close off the area after a road swallowed a Toyota Fortuner. The Fortuner was swallowed by a sinkhole after a major raw water pipe burst under Herriot Street, causing a large sinkhole. The George Municipality said a traffic incident delayed work at the site, which was referred to the police. “It was later discovered the drinking water pipe that runs parallel to the raw water line has also been damaged,” said the municipality. pic.twitter.com/pbMp0x8QtY
