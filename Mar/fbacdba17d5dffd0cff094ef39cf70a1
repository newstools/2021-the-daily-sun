Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) have been dealt a tough draw for the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup. The Limpopo outfit will play either Mamelodi Sundowns or Orlando Pirates for a spot in the last-4 of the Ke Yona Cup. In the other semi-final, Pretoria Callies will host Chippa United as they look to continue their fairytale run in the competition. But Dan “Dance” Malesela’s Chilli Boys will undoubtedly be the toughest test for the GladAfrica Championship side. TTM, who eased past Black Leopards 2-0 in their quarter-final at the Thohoyandou Stadium yesterday, will have to battle past the favorites in Downs or Bucs. The two giants will lock horns on the 15th of April for a right to face TTM. Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo and Alfred Ndengane each got on the scoresheet to send Vhadau Vha Dhamani into the semi-finals. They also bagged the bragging rights over their provincial rivals in a Limpopo derby. TTM are in semi-finals for the first time ever having lost in the second round on their debut season in competition in 2019. TTM, who have shown some improvement since they parted ways with Joel Masutha, continued their recent resurgence. They took the lead in the first half through Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo as they looked to make their early pressure count. The diminutive midfielder stole the ball in a dangerous area and duly punished the lackluster Leopards defence. Leopards, who were up against it in the second half, tried their best to claw their way back into the match. But Ndengane put the final nail in the coffin as he bagged the second from the penalty spot. This was after Edwin Gyimah had brought down Lerato Lamola as he was bearing down on goal. Leopards, who came into the clash wounded after recording their third consecutive defeat in the DStv Premiership when they were thrashed 3-1 by TS Galaxy last time out, will now focus solely on the league and fight for survival.
