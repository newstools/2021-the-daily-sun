IT’S points and survival that count, not playing pretty football! That’s the view of Maritzburg United coach Ernst Middendorp after his side drew 1-1 against Bloemfontein Celtic in a disappointing DStv Premiership clash played at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Saturday. While the German-born mentor admitted that it was not the best game to watch, his priority is to get the Team of Choice out of the relegation zone and pretty football goes out of the window. The draw sees United still deep in the relegation zone on 13 points from 17 games. “It was definitely not a football game you’d like to see again,’’ said Middendorp. “But at the moment it is all about picking up points. There were moments where I thought we could have done better in our counter attacks to finish things off. “However, it was painful to concede a goal in a moment where we were a bit shaky at the back. But it was a valuable point.” Maritzburg scored through Thabiso Kutumela before halftime. However, Menzi Ndwandwe levelled for the home side midway through the second half to deny the visitors three points. The Team of Choice were depleted in defence without Nazeer Allie (suspended), Travis Graham and Kwanda Mngonyama, who are both injured. New Serbian forward Dusan Stevic was also not available for unknown reasons. However, according to Middendorp, the Serb will be available when they play Kaizer Chiefs at Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow. This led to Middendorp encouraged about his side’s hopes of collecting four points in two matches. “We had four to five players out mainly in defensive positions (against Celtic),” added Middendorp. “Now we have to prepare for the game on Wednesday (tomorrow) against Chiefs, and we have to get points at home.”
