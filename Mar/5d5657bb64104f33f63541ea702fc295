TWO luxury cars rented for a wedding parade in Sydney, Australia crashed on Monday, 22 March when the drivers lost control. The first, a Porsche Carrera 911, was written off after it ran into a stationary truck. The other, a Lamborghini, crashed into a tree in nearby Horsley Park. The Porsche, valued at over R3 million, crashed on Gipps Street. Witnesses said it ended up on the wrong side of the road and hit the truck.  According to NSW Ambulances, two men in their 30s were conscious and breathing inside the Porsche when the ambulance arrived.  The crashes came as a result of the raging storms that hit New South Wales, which Premier Gladys Berejiklian called a one-in-a-100-year event.
