President Cyril Ramaphosa travelled to Tanzania to attend
the funeral of that country's president, John Magufuli, in the capital, Dodoma,
on Monday. According to the Tanzanian government, Magufuli died of
heart complications, but there was speculation that he contracted Covid-19 in
the weeks before his death. His death was announced last Wednesday. In April last year, Magufuli declared his country Covid-19
free and there was no official tally of cases there. In recent weeks, a number
of prominent people, including politicians, died in Tanzania. Even though it is believed that there may be a high
prevalence of Covid-19 infections in Tanzania, Ramaphosa should be relatively
safe because he received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which arrived in
South Africa just over a month ago. Virology professor, Francois Venter from the HIV research
organisation Ezintsha at the University of the Witwatersrand said South
Africans didn't have to worry about Ramaphosa contracting Covid-19. "We're lucky our president is totally protected from
severe illness," he said. "I just wish our politicians would take their and
others' protection more seriously. The images of the Zulu king's (Goodwill
Zwelithini) burial were chilling," he said. He was referring to the crowds
of people who gathered, many without masks, to pay their last respects. Ramaphosa was one of at least 10 presidents who attended the
funeral. His office announced his travel plans in a statement on Monday
morning. Thousands of Tanzanians reportedly gathered to pay their
respects. Presidency spokesperson Tyrone Seale did not immediately
respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Samia Suluhu Hassan was on Friday inaugurated as
Magufuli's successor in line with that country's constitution. SOURCE: NEWS24
