THEY say different strokes for different folks, right? Well, in this context, this is the closest thing to the truth and you're about to find out why.Women have different tastes from fashion, food to sexual preferences. HOW TO GIVE THE BEST BLOW JOB EVER! Women even have their own preferences when it comes to the 4-5.According to science, there are four different types of 4-5s. We take a closer look at them:1.The big oneAn anonymous survey was conducted by renowned sexologist Dr Vijaysarathi Ramanathan on his website about the various sizes of the 4-5. While it is known that the average 4-5 size is 14.15 cm, a man with a 17cm tool is considered a big guy. According to Dr Vijaysarathi Ramanathan's survey, big 4-5s can be fun as they can penetrate further, stimulating every part of a woman's vagina. But, the bad news is that it could hurt her badly and she might need more time to recover from the big action.2.The curved oneAccording to experts, a curved 4-5, during penetration, would be touching the upper wall of the punani, where the G-spot is. This type of the 4-5 is preferred by women.3. Captain hookThis 4-5 is almost like the curved one, only that it is bent slightly downward from the tip. This type of 4-5 becomes a hindrance during the missionary position, but is great for doggy-style.4. Little oneWhile we might underestimate its potential, the little 4-5 is the safest when it comes to long-term relationships because it promises the right fun with less soreness and involves much less recovery time.
