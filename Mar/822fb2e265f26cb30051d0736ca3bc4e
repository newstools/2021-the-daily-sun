SARAH Kgaphola never went to school because she didn’t have an ID. Later, the same thing happened to her children. However, the 59-year-old from Kagisanong View in Kgabalatsane, North West, wants an end to this. She’s appealing for help getting her family members IDs. Speaking to Daily Sun, Sarah said no one in the family could apply for social grants or get qualifications for a job. “It’s so sad to see my kids ending up like me. I wish there was something I could do to make their lives better,” she said. Sarah does piece work to take care of her family. “I’ve been trying to get an ID for years. “The problem is that I need to get a DNA test to prove I’m related to my aunt. “But I don’t have the money for that.” Sarah told the SunTeam she felt like a foreigner in her own country. “I know I was in the wrong for not having an ID, but this breaks my heart.” Her daughter, Dimakatso (32), said she wanted her three children to go to school, which was why she decided to ask for help. “We know there are Good Samaritans out there who help the poor,” she said. “We’d appreciate help so we can do the DNA tests. We’d appreciate any donations.” A worker at the Korwe Multi-purpose Centre in Ga-Rankuwa, who only gave her name as Portia, said she’d been helping the family since 2018. “We hope something comes up. We don’t want to see kids suffering and we’d appreciate people’s help,” Portia told the People’s Paper.
