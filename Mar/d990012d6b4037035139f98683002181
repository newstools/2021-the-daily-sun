Politicians in South Africa are used to toying with people’s lives. They always wait for people to protest and for lives to be lost before they attend to people’s constitutional rights! The death of Mthokozisi Ntumba should be put squarely on former president Jacob Zuma’s shoulders. Zuma cunningly set up the lame Cyril Ramaphosa for failure. In 2018, just before he vacated the presidency, Zuma made a promise to the poor and disadvantaged students of this country that the state would provide free tertiary education! He made this promise knowing very well he and his cronies bankrupted government and that there was no budget to make good on his evil-intended promise. In making that promise, which resulted in the death of an innocent man, Zuma was trying to paint himself as a “good guy.” But his foolish, selfish and evil-intended promise instead cost an innocent man his life! We all know Ntumba’s death means very little to the likes of Zuma and his cronies. But to the Ntumba family, Mthokozisi’s death is a big loss, especially to his wife and kids.
