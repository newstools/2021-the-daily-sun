Gugulethu residents have gathered at Luyolo Hall on Saturday, 27 March  to commemorate the life of the seven fallen Umkonto Wesizwe soldiers that were killed 35years ago. The event was organised by the Gugulethu Development Forum (GDF) in honouring the fallen heroes. Various religious leaders also prayed atin front of the statues that were erected at corner NY1 and NY111 in honour of the gallant soldiers. Deputy Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform Mcebisi Skwatshawho who hails from Gugulethu was among the leaders who attend the event. The deceased Mandla Simon Mxinwa, Zanisile Zenith Mjobo, Zola AlfredSwelani, Godfrey Miya, Christopher Piet, Themba Mlifi and Zabonke JohnKonile were killed on 3 March 1986 after they were shot at by apartheid police. “The Gugulethu 7 were brave gallant fighters who spilt their blood forus to be free today. Their legacy is for us to make sure that we builda united non-racist and non-sexist South Africa,” said Skwatsha. Skwatsha said he was one of the people who managed to get to thescene after the incident and witnessed the bodies scattered on the streets. Pastors gathered in front of the seven giant statues that were erected by the then ANC Western Cape government on Human’s Rights Day in 2005. Community leader Geoff Mamputha said young people should be educated about their history. He also called for communities to commemorate their heroes even those who did not die during apartheid time. Mamputha said a habit of celebrating heroes when they are dead sends the wrong message to young people. Speaking to Sunteam Nontlantla Miya (54) a sister to Godfrey said 35 years since the death of her brother feels like yesterday. “It feels like yesterday when we were told that my brother is dead. I can’tbelieve that it is already 35 years already,”  she said. General Bongani Jonas who is also a former Umkhonto weSizwe freedomfighter said the history of the people who died for the freedom that people enjoy today should be recorded.
