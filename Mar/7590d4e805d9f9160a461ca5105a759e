WOMEN suffer unseen scars that destroy their lives if left unattended. This is according to Busisiwe Mfaku, a community developer and author who launched her first book, She Shall Be Called a Woman. Busisiwe is also the co-founder of Women of Faith organisation, which offers women counselling. Busisiwe said she’s interacted with many women who’ve been hurt in various ways. She shared various types of scars and their effects. She said while scars are pain gained from the past, many of them were caused by men. “Single mums suffer financial distress and find it hard to let go of the pain caused by the father of their children. In some instances they want them back in their lives.” Busisiwe said divorced women later suffer depression, while widows suffer from loneliness. “Barren women feel empty and less than a woman. Their anger is often directed at God. They feel punished or less loved by God,” she said. “Rape victims are severely affected. They go through mixed emotions. They often blame themselves and find it hard to forgive themselves. “Women who’ve suffered physical, verbal and emotional abuse suffer from low-self esteem, bitterness and at times depression.” Busisiwe said poverty and health issues were also unseen scars. She said women who were infected by HIV were afraid to explore. “They box themselves due to the stigma surrounding the disease and lose faith in ever finding true love. “Women facing poverty often experience high levels of stress. “Many of these scars result in flashbacks if unattended. They rob women of fully engaging and participating in society.” Counselling is the first step in dealing with the past. The book is available on Amazon for R200.
