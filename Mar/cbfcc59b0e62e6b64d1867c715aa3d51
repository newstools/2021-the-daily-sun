LEARNING at H.S Phillips Memorial High School in Shirley village, Limpopo, has become a big challenge for pupils. This after the roof of one of the buildings was destroyed by a storm last month. Now grades 10 to 12 pupils are forced to have lessons under trees. But parents are worried for their safety as there are reptiles and monkeys in the trees. School governing body chairman Reginald Maluleke said to told Daily Sun: “There are monkeys living in the trees. Reptiles can also bite our children. “We hope the Department of Education attends to our matter as soon as possible.” Local headman Gareth Mabasa said the situation at the school had frustrated the royal council. He was part of a delegation that was expected to meet the department on Friday, 12 March, to look for quick intervention. Limpopo Education spokeswoman Tidimalo Chuene said they were aware that a block of classrooms was damaged by a storm. “We have started with the process to assess the damage at the school to see what can be salvaged and what should be replaced. “The school is among many others with infrastructure challenges, and we have prioritised the provision of sanitation facilities and clean running water,” she said. Chuene said that the infrastructure team from Vhembe District had recently assessed the damage. “The team recommended that the department procure five mobile classrooms as interim relief to create a conducive environment for learning.”
