FOLLOWING reports that finger Arthur Mafokate in the corruption at the National Council of Arts, the kwaito star has broken his silence. In a statement, he said he has no affiliations with the previous and current NAC boards. “I wish to state categorically that I have no affiliations with the previous board nor the current board, which is now in place. It is an incredibly sad day when people in the creative sector with the right intentions are slandered in this way. “Not everyone that is receiving funds is misusing funds, while that may be what members of the rumour mill’s perception is, it is not my intention to do so,” he said.
