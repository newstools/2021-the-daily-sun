PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane will be investigated for incompetence and misconduct. An independent panel appointed by National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise has found court rulings against Mkhwebane showed she was lacking in her knowledge of the law. Quoting the panel’s report yesterday, Modise said: “The findings, following the preliminary assessment, are that there is substantial information that constitutes prima facie evidence of incompetence. Examples of such incompetence are: prima facie evidence demonstrating the public protector’s overreach and exceeding the bounds of her powers in terms of the Constitution and the Public Protector Act.” Modise said Mkhwebane had repeatedly made similar errors in incorrectly interpreting the law and had failed to give parties affected by her investigations the opportunity to be heard. “According to the panel, these instances, cumulatively assessed, meet the threshold of prima facie evidence of sustained incompetence.” The panel also found that Mkhwebane failed to investigate a third complaint regarding the alleged involvement of certain politicians in the Vrede Dairy Project. She allegedly changed her final report on the matter and gave an untruthful explanation to the court when asked why this was done. “The panel recommends that, for the reasons contained in its reports, the charges based on the findings of prima facie evidence of incompetence and misconduct be referred to a committee of the National Assemble to investigate in terms of section 194 of the Constitution,” Modise said. “If the House decides the inquiry should go ahead, it must be referred to a special section 194 committee for formal inquiry. The Speaker must inform the president of any action or decision coming from the recommendations.” On Sunday 28 February, Mkhwebane told Daily Sun she and her legal team would plan a way forward. It will now be up to President Cyril Ramaphosa to suspend her, pending the investigation.
