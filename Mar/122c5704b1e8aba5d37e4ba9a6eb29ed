CAPE Town City have turned Twitter into a frenzy ahead of the Bafana Bafana team announcement this morning. Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki set to announce his Bafana squad for back-to-back Afcon qualifiers, against Ghana and Sudan. But the Citizens appear to have pre-empted the event, with a Mduduzi Mdantsane’s teaser on social media. Captioned: “Just leaving this here”, the image has set tongues wagging, seen as fans reacted with memes. The former Baroka FC attacking midfielder has been influential in the club’s attacking third. Mdantsane has scored nine league goals in 17 appearances this season. But despite his improved form, City have been going through a rough patch in the league. They haven’t won a league match since they beat Golden Arrows 4-2 in January. Since then, Jan Olde Riekerink’s side has failed to pick up maximum points in the last five league games, including Wednesday’s goalless draw against Chippa United in Mdantsane. In fact, in their last seven games in all competitions, City have won only once, mauling Bloemfontein Celtic 4-0 in the Nedbank Cup last-32 last month.
