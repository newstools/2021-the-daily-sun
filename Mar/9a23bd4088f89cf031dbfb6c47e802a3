FOUR police
officers have been arrested in connection with the alleged murder of Mthokozisi
Ntumba. Ntumba was
shot and killed in Braamfontein last week. The
Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) on Monday afternoon
confirmed that they had just arrested four police officers from the Public
Order Policing Unit in connection with the death of Mthokozisi Ntumba. IPID
spokesperson Ndileka Cola said in a statement: "The four officers will
appear at the Joburg Magistrates Court on Wednesday the 17 March 2021 and they
are facing charges of murder, three for attempted murder and defeating the end
of justice." The police
came under fire after police shot and killed an innocent civilian, Ntumba
during a student protest. What fueled
the rage against the police was social media images and a video which showed
the 'trigger happy' police unleashing rubber bullets onto protesters. Their
actions allegedly led to the subsequent death of Ntumba, who was at the wrong
place and at the wrong time after seeing a doctor in Hillbrow. The EFF has
promised to help the Ntumba family to sue the state, for their loved one's
death at the hands of police.
