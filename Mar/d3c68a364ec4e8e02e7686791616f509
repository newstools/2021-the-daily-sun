ORLANDO Pirates took another step in the right direction in their quest to challenge for the title. This, after they edged Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 in their DStv Premiership encounter, played at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday. Fortune Makaringe scored the only goal of the match in the second half to earn the Soweto giants the all-important three points. The result saw Bucs move up to third place on the Premiership table ahead of Swallows FC who suffered their first league defeat at the hands of TS Galaxy. They now have 32 points from 16 matches, four behind leaders and defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns. Bucs coach Josef Zinnbauer made just a single change from the win over Maritzburg United on Saturday with Kabelo Dlamini coming in for suspended Thabang Monare. The match started slow for both sides with not much to write home about in the early stages. The one big moment of the first half was the sending off of former Bucs striker Ndumiso Mabena for a dangerous tackle on Linda Mntambo. Pirates came out of the tunnel with renewed vigour, hoping to make their one-man advantage count. They had to wait until the 62nd minute to break the deadlock through a venomous Makaringe strike. Celtic pushed for the equalizer but they could not penetrate Bucs’ stout defence. Bucs coach Zinnbauer was delighted with the result, but not so much with the performance his side showed. “It was not our best performance,” admitted Zinnbauer. “But we played good in the last matches and did not get the reward so we take this result. It is important to take the points and move on. We will discuss the performance next time." Celtic coach John Maduka believes the red card was their downfall. “I think we looked okay when we had 11 players on the pitch,” said Maduka. “It was difficult playing against a quality team like Pirates with one man down.”
