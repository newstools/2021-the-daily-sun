GOOD Samaritan Suzan Mbazima helps those who are from disadvantaged families with the little money she has. The 23-year-old woman from Marite near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga has launched Outreach Foundation which aims to help girls and boys from disadvantaged families in Mpumalanga. She told Daily Sun Outreach Foundation is a company that seeks to meet the community halfway and it has been running since last May. “I don’t have much but with the salary range I earn from being a farm worker, I want to make sure I share it with the souls I can reach at least halfway. “I am the gift of the givers and I believe in sharing as I am from a background of the poorest of the poorest. I understand what it is like to be in need of something and not get it. So when I started the Outreach Foundation, I believed I was in a race to end poverty,” said Suzan. “I started this by buying 50 sanitary towels. I then bought shoe polish, roll-on, bath soaps and toothpaste. I am proud of what I’ve done so far.” “So I am pleading with the communities around Mpumalanga to keep in touch with me. I have a lot to give but let it be those who are truly in need,” she said.
