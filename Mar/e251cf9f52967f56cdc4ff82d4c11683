UNIVERSITY students have vowed to continue with their demands from free education until their demands are met. On Monday, 15 March, Braamfontein in Joburg was a no-go area for motorists as Wits University students caused chaos. They marched in the streets, closed roads and also forced shop keepers to closed their stores. To restore order in the area, the police refrained from using rubber bullets or anything that would be considered maximum force. They used water canon to disperse the students who kept on gathering and singing as soon as the cops were not around. The protest for free education is not new. It dates back to 2015 and to date, there’s still no free education.  Wits SRC president Mpendulo Mfeka said: “A week might not be enough to address our demands. We might need a month. We want a free education bill to be declared and the president to announce free education now.” Mfeka said: “Students have rendered Braamfontein ungovernable. As it stands currently, if you go around shops are closed. “We have declared yesterday that our job would be to shut down Braamfontein. “We are going to meet tonight and discuss a way forward. “There have been many intimidating threats, he said. Mfeka said they were not looking to damage anything during their protest. “We find it important to remain with maximum discipline in our protest. We are not in a position to be burning anything. We can’t be burning stuff as students. We are thinkers. We are thought leaders. We are supposed to build this country and not destroy it. “Let’s leave the killing to the police. As young people, let’s provoke thought.”
