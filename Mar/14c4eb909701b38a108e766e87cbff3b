MANIE Kiesling enjoys staying ekasi. The 58-year-old mlungu is having so much fun he might consider marrying ekasi, if he gets a good girlfriend. But he never thought he’d be accepted in Temba in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, when he opened his scrapyard in December. He didn’t think he’d live there that long. “The people here are amazing. They greet me whenever they pass my shack,” he said. Manie, who stays with his three dogs, lived in Wonderboom, also north of Tshwane, before he moved to Hammanskraal. He wasn’t comfortable talking about why he moved from Wonderboom. All he told the People’s Paper was he wanted a better and new life. His dogs Mona, Lizza and Black are his best friends and security. “I buy scrap metals and other tins from the local community to make a living. My motto is: no stolen items in my business. “Those who steal from others shouldn’t bother coming to sell them to me,” he said. Manie said he has employed two workers and would love to employ more in the future. He said he was renting at the moment, but intended to buy a house. “I’m not married and don’t have children. I will love to get married in kasi because woman in the area are beautiful,” he said. When he is not at his scrapyard, Manie spends his spare time planting spinach, carrots, tomatoes and pumpkins. One of his workers, Nicolus Lubisi (32), said: “I enjoy the work. It keeps me busy.” “He is a good person who is helping us,” she said.
