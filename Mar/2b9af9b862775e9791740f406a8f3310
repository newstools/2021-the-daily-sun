IT was a goal dry day in the DStv Premiership on Tuesday. The two matches between Golden Arrows and Baroka as well as Chippa United against Cape Town City, all ended in goalless draws. Abafana Bes’Thende, who have been one of the most enterprising teams this season, could not break down a stout Baroka defence at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium. But it was not for a lack of trying as Mandla Ncikazi’s charges were desperate to bounce back from their previous setback. They saw their three-game winning streak come to an end after losing 2-1 to Black Leopards a week ago. The KwaZulu Natal outfit was hoping to get back to winning ways and resume their push to challenge for continental football come the end of the season. A win would have seen Arrows, who have punched above their weight this season, leapfrog Swallows into fourth place. But Bakgaga were not having it and proved to be a tough nut to crack for Arrows. Ncikazi’s side stays in fifth place with 29 points from 17 matches, seven points adrift of leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. They have had little joy since they became the first team form KZN to win a Q-Innovation when they clinched Q-2 and walked away with a cool R1, 5 million. Their opponents on the day, Baroka, would have been pleased with the result as they avoided defeat against a dangerous Arrows team away from home. Bakgaga ended their four-game winless run after edging neighbours Black Leopards 2-1 last time out. They were looking for back-to-back wins in the league for the first time since their first two matches of the season. Matsimela Thoka and his charges are eying a top-eight finish this season and a win could have seen them move into that position. Nevertheless, a draw still keeps them in contention.They next face Stellenbosch FC at Peter Mokaba Stadium (5 pm) on Wednesday while Arrows face Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday (3.30 pm).
