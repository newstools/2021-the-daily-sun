BRIAN Molefe says he forgot to get ministerial approval for a transaction of billions of rands because he’s human. The former Transnet CEO appeared before the Zondo Commission on Wednesday, 10 March and was asked about an over R10 billion increase on a contract for 1 064 locomotives. Molefe said Transnet got approval from the minister for the tender price, but the increase fell in between the cracks. Evidence leader Anton Myburgh, asked: “You are talking billions of rands. How does one forget to get ministerial approval for an increase of billion of rands? “How does one fail to ensure that this regulatory compliance is achieved?” Molefe answered: “Because I’m human, chairperson.” In 2014, Transnet concluded a contract with four manufacturers to buy locomotives for R54 billion, making it one of the state-owned entity’s largest single procurements. Molefe said it was not true the price increased from R38 billion to R54,4 billion as reported, because the R38 billion was only an estimated tender cost. “We went out with R38 billion and the suppliers came back with about R43 billion. For the first time, we saw what the market was prepared to pay,” he said. Molefe said after negotiations, the bidder accepted R49 billion and a 10% increase later moved the contract to R54,4 billion. According to an investigation by Mncedisi Ndlovu and Sedumedi Attorneys, Transnet did a cost benefit analysis between two possible deals before making a decision to change the supplier from 19E Mitsui Locomotives to 21E China South Rail. Molefe disputed another report by Fundudzi Forensic Services, which found if Transnet had awarded the contract to Mitsui, the company would have saved R1,2 billion. Molefe said Metsui locomotives was failing and breaking down.
