TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) could be without two of their star players – Alfred Ndengane and Rhulani Manzini – for their crunch DStv Premiership clash against AmaZulu at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). The duo were involved in a bloody fight at training on Tuesday as Ndengane had to be rushed to a local medical centre, where he had stitches on his forehead. A reliable source told SunSport that both players will not be part of the team that will travel to Durban as they are expected to face the club disciplinary committee. “Ndengane and Manzini are not part of the team to play AmaZulu,” said our source. “They did not train with the team on Wednesday as the club management and coach (Dylan Kerr) were trying to find out from them what happened on Tuesday at training. This is going to be a huge setback for Kerr as these two are key to his team.” When SunSport called Kerr on the availability of the duo, the Englishman said: “All I want to talk about is the game against AmaZulu. This game is about points for us. We’re aware that Benni McCarthy has been doing well since he took over as AmaZulu coach. “The players are responding fantastic to him. So we are expecting a tough game. But we have to try to get good results and get away from the bottom zone.” TTM are currently 14th on the log and not yet safe from relegation. And a win against resistant Usuthu will be a huge boost in their bid to survive relegation. VhadauVhadamani have 16 points from 18 league matches. Kerr’s side are only four points ahead of bottom side Black Leopards. And Usuthu, under the Bafana Bafana legend McCarthy, have been enjoying a good run. The Durban-based side, who are sixth on the log with 31 points from 19 matches, come into this clash without defeat in nine consecutive league games – winning six and drawing three.
