IT is rumoured there will be changes at Ukhozi FM with a major reshuffle from 1 April. Insiders told Daily Sun that the situation was tense at the station as presenters and producers were told there would allegedly be salary cuts and fewer working days. This as the SABC was currently facing financial struggles. Prime-time show presenters will be removed, and no presenters and producers will work more than five days.

From April, Tshatha will host the midnight show and top 20 on Saturdays. This decision looks like punishment,” the source said.  The source said Dudu Khoza will not work five days on her midmorning show and other days will be hosted by Mroza Buthelezi. “Ukhozi is trying to get rid of Dudu because she is old, but it is afraid because it knows her loyal listeners will fight if she is removed. “The station is now trying to introduce Mroza to fill Dudu’s shoes,” said the source. The source added that midday show presenters Siya Mhlongo and Selby Mkhize will present the afternoon show. “They will be replaced by Bheka Mchunu. Mzo Gumede will be removed from the afternoon drive and will be content producer of the breakfast show. “Ayanda Melansi will be moved from content producer of the breakfast and maskandi show to midmorning show.” SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said the SABC embarked on line-up changes on an annual basis. “As is standard practice, an official announcement will be made as soon as line-up changes have been finalised,” she said.
