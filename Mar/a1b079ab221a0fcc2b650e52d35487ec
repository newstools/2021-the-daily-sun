FOUR police officers had their day in court following their arrests on Monday. The Public Order Policing officers – Tshephisho Kekana (27), Cidraas Motseothatha (43), Madimetja Legodi (37) and Victor Mohammed (51) – are facing charges of murder, attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice following the death of bystander Mthokozisi Ntumba, who was shot and killed during a student protest, allegedly by the officers in the dock. The officers kept their faces hidden when they stepped up to the dock at the Joburg Magistrates Court. The case has been postponed to Wednesday, 24 March and the officers have been remanded in custody. Gauteng NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonodwana said the state will be opposing bail. “As the prosecutor presented in court, the state will be opposing bail. It is a schedule five offence. “The prosecutor said for bail application purposes, the state is not reliant on the video footage, or witness statements.” Mjonodwana said as the state they are keeping their cards close to their chest and would not confirm nor deny if they have other CCTV footage, except the one doing the rounds on social media. Explaining the attempted murder charges, Mjonodwana said: “At the scene, while police were dispersing the protesters, there were people who were injured and so far, the state has received the statements of the people who were injured.” Meanwhile, the City of Tshwane hosted a memorial service for Mthokozisi.
