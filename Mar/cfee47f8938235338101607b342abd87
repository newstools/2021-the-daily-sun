POLICE have arrested two suspects aged 34 and 35 on Wednesday evening, 3 March, with cellphones and electronic gadgets worth more than R300 000. This comes after a group of armed suspects travelling in a VW Polo allegedly hijacked a courier bakkie that was on its way to deliver a cargo of cellphones and electronic gadgets to various businesses in and around Apel, outside Burgersfort in Limpopo, on 2 March. The bakkie was robbed along the R37 road near Malomane Village outside Burgersfort. Police received a tip-off and a manhunt ensued which led them to a house at Extension 44 in Greenside outside Polokwane. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said upon arrival, the house was searched and one suspect was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. He was immediately arrested. The second suspect was arrested while hiding in the ceiling and two firearms and ammunition were found in his possession.  “The house was further searched and a large number of cellphones and several other electronic gadgets, with the estimated value of over R300 000, were recovered. “The VW Polo believed to be the vehicle used during the hijacking incident was also confiscated. The suspects will appear in the Polokwane Magistrate Court soon on charges of possession of suspected stolen properties, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition,” he said. Ngoepe told Daily Sun the suspects will also later appear in the Apel Magistrate Court on a further charge of car hijacking. “More arrests are still expected as the police investigations are unfolding,” he said. Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the remaining suspects involved in this case is urged to call Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501, CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or contact their nearest police station.
