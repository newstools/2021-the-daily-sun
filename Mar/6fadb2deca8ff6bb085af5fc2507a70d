MADALA Matlala Manamela celebrated his 100th birthday in Hammanskraal, Tshwane on Sunday, 14 March. He told the SunTeam that his secret to living this long is eating vegetables he planted himself in his yard. He said growing vegetables is the only thing that makes him happy and keeps him strong and healthy. “Young people are amazed when I work in the garden as they don’t believe I can still dig and lift tools. “I hate eating vegetables that are not from my garden because God gave me hands to plant them,” he said. “I sometimes teach the community about small farming in their backyards and that makes me happy,” he said. Madala Matlala said he’s a testimony that eating healthy food makes one live longer. The former teacher was good in geography, history and Sepedi. “I am also a preacher at the African Methodist Episcopal Church. When I get tired, I read the Bible,” he said. He lives with a helper who takes care of him. Matlala has six children, more than 14 grandchildren and five great-grandkids. His daughter, Kedibone Kgoebane, said: “We’ve learnt a lot from him. He loves his children and encouraged us to be united,” she said. Ward councillor Sello Mphaga said madala Matlala is a VIP in the area. “He is straightforward and an educated person, and is the light of the community,” he told Daily Sun. Chairman of Temba Old Age Projets, Kabelo Edmund Kekana (58), said they continued to learn a lot from madala Matlala. “He is a veteran, teacher and leader,” he said.
