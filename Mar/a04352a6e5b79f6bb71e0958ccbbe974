SWALLOWS FC learnt the hard way that if you do not take your chances, you will be punished. After being in control for the better half of the match, the Dube Birds were left to rue missed chances as they were held to a 1-1 draw in the last minute of their DStv Premiership match by Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) at Dobsonville Stadium yesterday. Zaphaniah Mbokoma opened the scoring, putting the home side ahead in the 31st minute of the match. However, the visitors still probed and salvaged a point at the death when Alfred Ndengane won a penalty off a foul from Phetso Maphanga before going on to send Vries the wrong way. They went to the half-time break with The Birds leading. However, Swallows could have buried the match early with the number of chances they created. Swallows leading goal scorer Ruzaigh Gamildien, Kamohelo Mahlatsi and Mbokoma, all missed clear cut chances throughout the game, which they will now regret. The result now sees them dropping from the fourth to the fifth spot in the log standings. They started the season on a high. But the Soweto giants tasted their first defeat of the league campaign in midweek as they lost 2-1 to TS Galaxy. Swallows have now played seven matches without a win. They last won a match on 16 January when they defeated Baroka FC 1-0.
