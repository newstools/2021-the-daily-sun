Lamontville Golden Arrows coach Mandla Ncikazi was left to reflect on a successful four days in the Limpopo province that saw his side pick up back-to-back wins over Black Leopards and TTM and move into second in the DStv Premiership. Golden Arrows’ latest success on Wednesday came in the form of a 2-1 victory over TTM in a match that was stopped for a short period due to torrential rain and thundershowers. “We are just grateful as a team to get six points in Limpopo, it was not easy,” Ncikazi says. “But we are happy that the players could take the load, run in weather conditions like it was in Venda. We are still in the objectives that we planned pre-season, of getting 10 points in a group of five [matches].” Ncikazi also thanked chairperson Mato Madlala, who took the unusual step of hiring a charter flight for the team to travel from Durban to Polokwane. “I must also point out that we want to thank our chairlady for giving us the support in terms of travel arrangements,” he said. “From Durban to Venda is a very difficult trip but she hired a charter flight for the team and I am sure the result we got is based on the travel arrangements.” Golden Arrows have been the surprise package of the DStv Premiership season, but Ncikazi has warned his players they have achieved nothing yet. “I hope we can manage the little success [we have had], we shouldn’t do what happened previously when we won the Q2, then the next match the mentality was not right [in a 2-1 home loss to Leopards]. “I just hope that now, the next match Cape Town City [on March 20] we keep the same mentality that says, ‘we have not won anything [yet]’. “The players have been marvelous, but I want them to keep the focus that has made them what they are.” Golden Arrows are a single point off leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, but have played three games more, in tonight and that's all we can do." -SuperSport
