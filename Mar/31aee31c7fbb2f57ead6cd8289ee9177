TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) duo – Tokelo Rantie and Brandon Theron – are doubtful stars for their DStv Premiership encounter against Moroka Swallows at Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). The former Bafana Bafana and Mamelodi Sundowns striker Rantie injured his shoulder in Tshakhuma’s Nedbank Cup last-16 win on a penalty shoot-out against The Dube Birds at Peter Mokaba Stadium last week following a 2-2 draw after extra time. The 30-year-old, whose football career has been in decline, joined Tshakhuma last month aiming to resurrect it. And if this injury is serious it will be a huge setback for him as he can’t afford to be out for a lengthy period. Rantie joined Tshakhuma last month on a short-term deal until the end of the season and was hoping to impress Vhadau Vhadamani new owner Abraham Sello, with a view to renewing his contract. “Rantie has been coming right and everyone was happy with him at training,” said Tshakhuma coach Dylan Kerr. “It will be sad if this injury is serious. But we will know before the end of this week if it’s serious or not. “I am praying for him it will not to be serious. He is a good lad who wants to play football again.” Defender Theron on the other hand is home in Cape Town after his brother was shot and killed on Saturday. “It’s sad time for the Theron and his family,” said the former Black Leopards and Baroka coach. “But Theron knows that myself and the club are behind him. He has our full support. I assume that he won’t be available for this weekend game. But if he comes back and wants to play, its fine with me. But it’s up to him.” Kerr, who have been watching Tshakhuma from the stands as he is still waiting for his work permit from Home Affairs, said he hopes to be on the bench on Sunday. “I hope my work permit will be ready this weekend,” said Kerr. “But If I don’t get it for Sunday’s game, it’s still fine as I have been enjoying shouting from the stands.”
