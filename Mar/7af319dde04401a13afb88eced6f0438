Rhulani Manzini has been FIRED by Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), with immediate effect. This is after being found guilty of misconduct following his fight with Alfred Ndengane earlier this month. As SunSport first reported, Manzini unleashed a powerful punch on teammate Alfred Ndengane in the forehead, which left the 34-year-old Capetonian with an open gash on the forehead. The club on Tuesday held a disciplinary hearing about the case where the two players had full representation. The decision was reserved for Wednesday where it was ruled Manzini must be released from his contract while Ndengane was acquitted with a final warning. Club's Liaison Manager, Rufus Matsena, confirmed that Manzini was released after being found guilty. He said: "This is nothing personal to any of the players affected. We just want to instil discipline in the team and enforce that violence will not be tolerated at TTM. Acts of misconduct will be treated harshly and I'm sure that other players are learning that misconduct can get you into trouble." In an ugly fistic bout that ensued at the club's training ground, Manzini and Ndengane, tore each other apart in front of shocked fellow teammates, as well as Dylan Kerr. The brawl started with a bad tackle from Manzini on Ndengane and they apparently started pushing each other in anger and retaliation. In frustration and humiliation, Ndengane kicked the ball outside play in their training match and an harsh argument ensued, which led to the fight. Kerr, who's future with the club is still uncertain after apparently apologised for having quit his job via a text message, intervened to cool down the situation. But Daily Sun understands that the 33-year-old Manzini unleashed a powerful punch on Ndengane, which left him with an open gash on the forehead.
