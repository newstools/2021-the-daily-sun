SOCIAL media was abuzz on Wednesday with mixed emotions from soccer fans debating Itumeleng Khune's video that has been trending where he's seen with a group of friends dancing. It cannot be verified when the video was shot, but tweepsters are condemning it if this was during lockdowns where gatherings were prohibited . Others argue that the video is old and why is it popping now that Khune's form has dipped for the worst during this season, while others say it's a ploy to discredit the Chiefs No.1 goalie. This is not the first time Khune was caught on camera in a night club where he was having fun with friends, obviously after work hours from his club Kaizer Chiefs. But most are angry considering that his club is not performing well, and he has been erratic when he's in between the goal posts. Others are calling it harassment to the 33 years-old from Ventersdorp in the North West. The Bafana Bafana and Chiefs No.1 goalie was at some stage seen flashing a black card, which irked Amakhosi supporters in 2019.
