MAPULA Khune’s death is a still mystery, but her family made sure she had a dignified send off. Khune was buried at Ventersdorp Cemetery in the North West on Thursday, 11 March. She was burnt beyond recognition last week in Ventersdorp at her parents’ home. Mapula was the sister to Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper, Itumeleng Khune. A stream of BMWs with wreaths on top arrived at a community hall on Thursday at about 9am. One of the cars in the fleet had Mapula’s beautiful coffin in it. Family members, including Itumeleng, close friends and some residents were also in attendance to pay their last respects. The SunTeam wasn’t allowed inside the hall. A family member allowed the team to take photos with strict instructions as to what to capture and what to leave out. On the programme a neighbour, friends, colleague and family representatives were given an opportunity to talk about Mapula. Reading her obituary, Lerato said Mapula was a marketing graduate. She also had a business management certificate in applied digital marketing. Her aunt said: “We, as the family, have agreed not to allow the media in as we needed the funeral to be as private as possible.” Mapula’s charred body was found in the backroom of her parents’ home. A 17-year-old teenager arrested for her murder was set free by the Ventersdorp Magistrates Court. Mapula’s mother earlier in the week explained how her daughter had a premonition where she saw ambulances, fire trucks and the police arriving at her home. At the graveyard, family members laid wreaths on her grave and sang as they surrounded the grave after sand was poured in. Mourners cried uncontrollably, showing that Mapula was loved by many. A docket has since been sent back to the police by the NPA after saying there was not enough evidence to prosecute the teenager who was earlier arrested.
