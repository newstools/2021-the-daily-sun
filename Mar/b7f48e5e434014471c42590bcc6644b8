PAUL Pogba has got his R7 million Rolls-Royce back - which was parked at a cop shop in England. He was slapped with an almost R200 000 fine for having left the car at the pound for 270 days. It was spotted in the drive of his R62 million home in Hale, Cheshire — still sporting Monaco plates. A source told thesun.co.uk "it’s incredible to think Paul took so long to sort out getting his car back". “It’s not a little runaround — it’s a stunning limited edition Rolls-Royce which anybody would love to sit in, let alone own.  “Instead, it gathered dust because Paul took absolutely ages to sort the necessary paperwork,” said the source. Cars brought into the country by non-citizens must be registered with the DVLA and fitted with UK plates within six months or they are seized. But Pogba, who moved back to United in 2016 in a R1,9 billion transfer from Juventus and earns R590 000 a week, was never going to be forced to use public transport. Following the seizure of the Rolls, he was seen driving in a R5,4m Ferrari 812 Superfast, a R6m Lamborghini Aventador and a R2,8m Bentley Flying Spur. He was also spotted behind the wheel of a R2,4m Maserati Quattroporte, a R2,1m Audi RS6 Power R and a R830 000 Chevrolet Camaro.
