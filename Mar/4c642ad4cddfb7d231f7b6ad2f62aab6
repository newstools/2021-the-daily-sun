METRO FM and Ukhozi FM are among radio stations accused of bribery. On Wednesday, gatvol artists gathered to demonstrate outside the SABC, demanding the payola system to be dismantled. Carrying placards and chanting, they accused producers, compilers and top DJs of sidelining their music and local content if they didn’t pay bribery. They said artists were expected to pay between R10 000 to R100 000 for their music to be aired. Poet Mzwakhe Mbuli, musician Tebogo Sithathu and Eugene Mthethwa were among the protesters. Some placards read: “Artists’ rights are violated by corrupt producers and compilers.” Others were written: “SABC must dismantle the selection committee of payola.” Speaking to Daily Sun, Tebogo said artists singing in indigenous language were mostly affected. “Enough is enough! Management needs to correct the system and not allow payola. Artists who are refusing to pay are sidelined and their music is only played when they have died, and they die as paupers,” he said. “Ordinary artists with beautiful music are suffering as they are demanded to pay bribery for airplay. We are also tired of the SABC hiring individuals based on the number of followers they have and making them broadcasters,” added Tebogo. Reading the memorandum, Mzwakhe said: “Artists are punished, silenced, intimidated and held at ransom by producers and compilers. Artists are subjected to payola, which is regarded as high-priority crime. Payola has left many families broken. Artists live in shame, suffer in silence and are glorified when they die. Most of them go to the grave with broken hearts,” he said. The artists demanded the SABC to freeze royalties to collecting societies. The memorandum was handed over to SABC radio group executive Nada Wotshela.
