WAYWARD midfielder Masibusane Zongo has been given a lifeline to rekindle his career. Zongo has been signed by GladAfrica Championship side Bizana Pondo Chiefs. According to club chairman, Nathi Mqokiyana, he signed Zongo after the player has been training with them since January and is fit and ready to feature for the club. Zongo, known for his off-field issues, was last on the books of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), where he was released last February. “There’s no doubt Masibusane has talent,” said Mqokiyana. “Age is still on his side as he’s 30 years old. He can still play another five or 10 years. You look at the late John “Shoes” Moshoeu, who played until he was 45-year-old and Siyabonga Nomvethe (he played until he was 42), the evidence is there. With the time that we had with Zongo, it convinced us that he deserves another chance.” Zongo won two league titles under Gavin Hunt’s SuperSport in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons. Since then he has played for Stellenbosch FC, Bidvest Wits, Chippa United, Platinum Stars and Royal Eagles. “We are a club that gives people a second chance,” added Mqokiyana. Pondo who were promoted to the Championship this season, have given other players who have struggled to get clubs, a second chance. Abia Nale, who last played football in 2018, was recently signed by the club. The club also revived the career of goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela, who is now club goalkeeper coach. Former AmaZulu defender Mxolisi Mayongo was recently added to the side. Musa Bilankulu, who is now at the twilight of his career, was signed late last year after leaving Golden Arrows midway through last season. Zongo’s first match for Pondo Chiefs could come against Championship leaders Sekhukhune United at Makhulong Stadium today (3.30pm).
