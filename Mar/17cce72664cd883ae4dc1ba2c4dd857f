SPAR Proteas coach Dorette Badenhorst says she was impressed by the debutants’ performance yesterday during their 58-30 victory over Namibia in the Tri-Nations tournament. The tournament, which features three of Africa’s top netball nations – South Africa, Uganda and Namibia – is taking place in Cape Town and will end on 31 March. On Wednesday, before the tournament started, Badenhorst said the absence of some of her key players, who are playing league netball in Australia and the United Kingdom, will provide opportunities for rising stars. That was the case as five players, Nonsikelelo Mazibuko, Chantelle Swart, Nozipho Ntshangase, Simoné Rabie, and Sian Moore, made their debuts against the Namibian Debmarine Desert Jewels. Badenhorst, who managed to give a run to all 12 players in the first match, said she was impressed. “I was pleased with the performance of the new caps,” she stated after the match. “They will have to get rid of some of their jitters, which is important. “We played well for a first game, our conversion rate from centre passing was good, but there were still a lot of mistakes. “The team needs to adapt to the new circle players, without regulars like star shooter Lenise Potgieter. “The biggest challenge has been in the circle because overseas players are mainly shooters and defenders. But it has been exciting to try out new circle combinations and I am happy with the progress we made.” Having missed action the whole of last year due to Covid-19, the Proteas are using this tournament to regain mileage and as part of their preparation for the 2023 Netball World Cup.
