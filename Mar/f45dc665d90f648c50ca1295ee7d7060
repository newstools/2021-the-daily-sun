MATSHELA Koko claims he was deliberately told Gupta lieutenant Salim Essa’s email address belonged to Eskom board chairman, Ben Ngubane. Koko said he was used and “very angry that we exposed Eskom information”. He was testifying at the Zondo Commission earlier today. The former Eskom CEO said former legal head Suzanne Daniels gave him the address in July 2015, saying it was Ngubane’s. He suspected Daniels had been bribed. Daniels earlier denied the allegation made by Koko, but he said: “She’s lied to you many times. I don’t think she knows what lies she’s told before.” In emails to Essa, Koko discussed tenders, operational matters and the prepayment Gupta-owned company Tegeta used as a bank guarantee when buying Optimum Coal Mine. He didn’t check if the email address was Ngubane’s. Evidence leader Pule Seleka said he should’ve realised he wasn’t talking to Ngubane when he received an email discussing visas for a family holiday to Indonesia. He didn’t ask questions because he was desperate to travel. “I’m much more than convinced those emails came from an external party, but I’m not sure it was Salim Essa,” he said.
