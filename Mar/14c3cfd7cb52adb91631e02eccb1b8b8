At the beginning of the year, Minister of Higher Education Dr Blade Nzimande instructed Unisa to cut the number of first-year students by 20 000. The students took the matter to court and won the case. If students hadn’t gone to court, what would have happened to the 20 000 potential students? Last month, Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni delivered his budget speech. He cut the Nsfas funding without providing an alternative. Interestingly, Cabinet approved his budget. Last week, Wits students revolted against Mboweni cutting funding fo Nsfas. During the protest in Braamfontein, an innocent life was lost. Interestingly, the same day the police killed an innocent person Cabinet approved more funds to Nsfas. It took the Wits students to revolt and the life of an innocent person for Cabinet to do the right thing. The government has promised free education and is reneging on its promise. It’s time the nation held it to account, or vote it out. We can’t have the same problem every year. - Letter by Thabile Mange
