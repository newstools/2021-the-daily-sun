After being in power for 27 years, the corrupt ANC is playing victim and blaming four million whites. Poverty, unemployment and inequality are increasing because of bad policy choices. State-owned enterprises are collapsing because of bad leadership. The quality of education has been decreasing since 1994: we’re celebrating mediocrity. The ANC government is pursuing the mad idea of the NHI, which will collapse the health system. Kganthane R Lebaka, Ga-Phaahla
