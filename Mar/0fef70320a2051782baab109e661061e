BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki revealed that he had a lengthy conversation with Bongani Zungu to ensure that he is mentally and physically ready to help the country qualify for the Africa Nations Cup in Cameroon. Zungu, who plies his trade for Scottish giants Rangers was named in Ntseki’s 26 man squad to face Ghana and Sudan. Bafana will tackle Ghana at FNB Stadium on 25 March and then tackle Sudan at El Hilal Stadium, in Sudan  three days later. Zungu was among the Rangers players that were suspended by Rangers coach Steven Gerrard for breaking Covid-19 rules. However, Ntseki says the midfielder explained to him what transpired which lead them to face the club’s Disciplinary Committee. Explained Ntseki: “We were waiting for the club to decide what to do with the situation of Bongani. We know that he is a national asset and there was so much attention on him. We respect the club’s verdict on dealing with the matter. "They had DC with Bongani and addressed it the way they did and he played in Europa League match. I found it wrong what he did and he explained after DC what happened and apologies.” Ntseki has advised Zungu to fully focus on his career instead of matters outside the pitch. He went on: “He posted (on twitter) that people are building a wall to block his path, and I said to him break those walls to move forward and help the team qualify.”
