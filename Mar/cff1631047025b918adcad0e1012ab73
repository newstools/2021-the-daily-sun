THERE’S no doubt that Peter Shalulile’s goal celebration is one of the weirdest out there. The Mamelodi Sundowns striker can often be seen jumping around before hurling his body over advertising boards after he scores a goal. This has led to some supporters fearing he could inadvertently injure himself, but he insists “I’m a tire, I just roll.” And now it appears other players are copying his celebrations. Shalulile’s compatriot, Namibia women’s team captain Zenatha Coleman, recently copied the celebration after finding the back of the net. The Sevilla midfielder in the Spanish Primera División said it wasn't as easy as it looks to hop, skip and jump like Shalulile.
