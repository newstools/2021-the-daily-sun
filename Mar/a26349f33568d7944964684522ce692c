RESIDENTS who closed the Mabopane Terminus Police Station on Thursday while protesting said they’re tired of corrupt cops. Residents of Mabopane block B picketed and chanted outside the police station and said corrupt cops must be moved out. Community leader, Jomo Rapholo, said when residents report cases like theft and robbery, police tell them to find the suspect themselves and bring him to the police station. “When we find the suspects and beat them up, they arrest us and let the thug go,” he said. He said on Tuesday someone robbed a tuck shop in the area and the person was not arrested. READ: PRISON POKE INMATE SERVING LIFE FOR RAPE! Said Rapholo: “Cops said they’ll not arrest the person because the owner of the shop is not South African, meaning that foreigners are supposed to be robbed. We want the provincial commissioner to come and address us. “The cops know the drug dealers and criminals and they can’t help the community.” The community handed over a memorandum, which was signed and received by Caroline Mputla from the office of the community safety MEC. She promised the community she’d take their memorandum to the relevant people and have a follow-up meeting on 29 March. Captain Kay Makhubele said police received the memorandum and the complaint will be attended to. “We urge the community to report cases if they know who is corrupt,” he said.
