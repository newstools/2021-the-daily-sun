MPUMALANGA police have launched a manhunt for suspects who shot and robbed a post office manager, Charles Mabaso (51), before bombing a cash safe at Hluvukani Post Office. The incident occurred in Hluvukani in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. The armed suspects attacked the man and ransacked his bedroom. They shot him before putting him in his Isuzu bakkie and driving off with him. South African Post Office spokesman Johan Kruger said: “Mabaso was shot and wounded in his leg, and is in hospital at the moment. We cannot confirm whether any cash was taken from the post office, because the police is investigating the scene and the post office employees will only be able to check once the post office has completed its investigation. “The area manager will visit Mabaso and he will receive trauma counselling. Anyone with any information can contact the police or the post office crime line on 0800 020 070.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “Police are looking for information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects who attacked the manager of Hluvukani Post Office.  “The victim was asleep at his residence when he was attacked by an unknown number of suspects. They forced the door open and they threatened him with a firearm, and shot him in his finger and in his leg, demanding keys to the post office. “They assaulted him and forced him into his bakkie, and drove up to the Hluvukani Post Office, where they instructed him to open the main door. The suspects proceeded to the safe, and bombed it. “They took an undisclosed amount of cash, two laptops and three cellphones. They fled the scene with his bakkie with the registration number DCP485MP.” Cases of attempted murder, house robbery and business robbery have been opened for investigation.
