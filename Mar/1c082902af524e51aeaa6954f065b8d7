Self-proclaimed
prophet Shepard Bushiri has used his daughter's death to attack the South
African government. She had been battling a severe lung infection. Bushiri said his daughter was blocked from getting the medical attention she needed in time when they were stopped from leaving Malawi for Nairobi in Kenya to seek medical attention. He said it was heart-breaking to hear doctors saying had she received the medical attention sooner, she would’ve been alive. “When I spoke to the doctor, he highlighted that if she had not been blocked at the airport the first time she needed to travel to Kenya for medical assistance, she wouldn’t have passed on. We wish we could have reversed this. But we believe if it’s God’s time, there is nothing we can do but to accept,” he said. According to reports, Bushiri’s eight-year-old daughter Israella died in the early hours of Monday after being hospitalised for three weeks. Last week, Bushiri revealed that she was unable to breathe on her own and was in ICU. He described Israella as a strong young girl who loved to worship and serve God. He said despite her young age, she was brilliant in her speech and possessed a divine excellency in the way she spoke and even tackled her studies. He said she was born during a time when together with his wife Mary, they were going through great persecution and she lived her life witnessing what it meant to fight and labour for the Lord despite trials and battles. “She came at a time when we really needed her. And through it all, she offered my wife and I, including the entire church, great comfort and enlightenment,” he said. Bushiri declared the next three days as the time to celebrate Israella’s life. “Today, my wife and I choose not to mourn but to celebrate her life. I do not believe that the devil could take the life of my daughter,” he said. He pleaded with all the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church leaders to carry him and his wife in prayers as they go through this difficult time.
