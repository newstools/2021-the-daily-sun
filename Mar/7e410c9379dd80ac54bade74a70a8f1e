BAFANA Bafana striker Percy Tau says they did their best in the match against Ghana and believes they got a fair result. Bafana were held to a 1-1 draw at FNB Stadium on Thursday night in an Africa Cup of Nation qualifier match.Tau scored Bafana's goal in the 52nd minute of the match to level matters as the visitors were the first to find the back of the net in the 49th minute of the game.Talking after the match, Tau said: "We did our best. "People may not understand how hard we try but we hope that they do because we try hard to win games. I'm proud of the guys though and I think they tried very hard. We have a few players who haven't played at this level, but I think we tried very hard.""We played well in the first half and we did the same in the second half. They (Ghana) had their 15 minutes in the second half where they were very dangerous. They looked at our system and they came up with a different one in the second half," Tau said."It is a fair result but we would have loved to win the match at home."Bafana were without some of their overseas players, such as Bongani Zungu, who was not released by his Scottish club Rangers.Bafana will no travel to Sudan, where they will have to finish the job against the Sudanese on Sunday by getting at least another draw to qualify for the Afcon finals held in Cameroon early next year.Tau said: "It is difficult in these times of Covid-19, but we are looking forward to the next game in Sudan. We did not have enough days to prepare. We did not have the other guys because of the pandemic, but it is football, and we tried our best."We just have to try harder and we have little time to work together in the squad and the players also understand that they want to make the nation proud."Bafana are second in their group with 10 points, same as Ghana, who have booked their spot to the finals.Â Sudan are third with nine points after five matches. A draw on Sunday will see Bafana qualifying inferior head-to-head.
