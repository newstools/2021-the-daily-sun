THE FAMILY of 11-year-old Tibane Mahanyele, who went missing on Monday and later found dead, were left shocked when a teenage boy known to the family was arrested for his murder. The boy had come by the house to check if Tibane had been found. The suspects were arrested on Tuesday after Tibane’s phone was found in one of them. Tibane had allegedly left his home in GaMamadila Village outside Polokwane to go with the suspects to neighbouring village GaMakweya to watch soccer at the weekend. His body was found by herders on Tuesday evening dumped in nearby bushes with a wound on his forehead. Tibane’s aunt, Orocia Chokoe, (57) told Daily Sun they suspect they took Tibane to the sports field to rob him of his cellphone. “While we were searching for him on Tuesday, the same boy who was found with Tibane’s phone, came to ask if he had been found or not,” she said.  She said when they arrived at the scene the boy denied in front of everyone, including the police, that he knows Tibane. Even when he was shown his body. Tibane’s mum, Machuene Mahanyele, (36) said her son was a good boy. “He was humble and always at home. I don’t know how those boys convinced him to go to the soccer field,” she said. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the two minor suspects were still being processed by a probation officer..
