Chippa United have confirmed the appointment of Luc Eymael as technical director. This is following the sacking of Dan "Dance" Malesela with immediate effect, which broke through SunSport on Sunday. "The club appointed well-travelled Belgian, Luc Eymael, in a Technical Advisor role where he will play an integral mentorship role for the technical team," said the club in a statement on Monday, confirming what SunSport reported on the day. Siyabulela Gwambi, the side's assistant coach, takes over the head coach responsibilities on an interim basis and will be working with Eymael. Gwambi, who is from Zwide, has been a part of the club coaching structures since 2015, having helped promoted the side from their youth structures, and was with the Diski Challenge team. "It is the club intent to have Eymael forming part of the technical team. This is subject to consultations with our partners, sponsors and supporters. We have also sought necessary clearances from the Safa on his appointment," statement read. Chippa boss, Siviwe Mpengesi, wrote a letter to Safa on Sunday seeking advise on the appointment of Eymael, who has had his ups and downs with local coaches. Eymael was axed by Tanzanian club Yanga SC following derogatory remarks that raised an uproar throughout the continent. A decision was then taken by Safa to ban him from working in South Africa, but the Belgian fought back through Fifa's ethics committee who set aside Safa's decision and cleared him to work wherever he wanted. Chilli Boysâ€™ next fixture is against Mamelodi Sundowns at Sisa DukasheStadium in East London next Monday, 12 April. ?????CHIPPA UNITED UPDATEThe Club would like to formally announce that it has amicably parted ways with Dan Malesela.Assistant coach Siyabulela Gwambi will fill in as interim coach.
