The DStv Premiership returns this weekend after the Fifa international break but there are only five fixtures to be played with Mamelodi Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates all involved in Caf club competition action. There are battles at the foot of the table and in the race for top eight places that could be key and, as ever, it is likely there will be no shortage of drama. Here is a quick guide to all the games.SWALLOWS FC V LAMONTVILLE GOLDEN ARROWSSwallows FC were flying high in the early part of the season but look to have run out of momentum having not won any of their last eight DStv Premiership matches (D7 L1).They have not exactly been losing either, but too many draws will be frustrating for the ambitious Dobsonville side, who will be anxiously looking over their shoulders in the race for top-eight places if they cannot turn those stalemates into wins.Five of those eight games have finished 1-1, and they have scored more than once in only one of their last 10 league games, which was last time out in a 2-2 draw with Chippa United on March 30. They led 2-0 after 10 minutes of that game but let their advantage slip.No team has drawn as many games (11) as Swallows this season. They will also be without leading scorer Ruzaigh Gamildien for this clash after his red card in that Chippa game.Golden Arrows sit in second in the league, four points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns but having played two games more. With the latter not in action, they could move to within one point and start to apply some pressure.Their last six games have resulted in three wins, two draws and one defeat, while last time out they were held 1-1 at home by Cape Town City.Abafana Bes’thende have lost just once on the road this season (W4 D4), at the same City in January (2-4), and their 30 goals scored is a joint highest along with the Cape Town club.Only three teams, Sundowns (9), Swallows (15) and Orlando Pirates (16) have conceded fewer than Golden Arrows’ 19 goals this campaign.The Durban club have already accumulated more points this season (36) from 20 games than they managed in the entire campaign in 2019-20 (34).CAPE TOWN CITY V BAROKA FCAt one stage Cape Town City looked as though they could be championship outsiders this season, but that notion is now well and truly behind them and it is about top-eight qualification after a poor run of results.They are winless in their last seven DStv Premiership games (D4 L3) since they beat Golden Arrows on January 24, with the goals suddenly drying up for the prolific side in recent weeks. They have managed just five in those seven games.They also only have one win in their last four home games, all played in 2021, unusual for a side that had made the Cape Town Stadium a fortress.They welcome a Baroka team in dire form, though they are a side that has proven a bogey club in the past for City.Baroka have won only two of their last 15 games in all competitions (D6 L7), though one of those wins did come just up the N2 from Cape Town at Stellenbosch FC.The teams played to a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture in Limpopo in late January, but Baroka lead the overall head-to-head 4-3 with four draws.In the four previous meetings in Cape Town, there has been one win each and two draws.It is usually a fixture that sparks goals, in the 11 previous meetings there have been 32 goals scored, a healthy average.MARITZBURG UNITED V CHIPPA UNITEDA crunch clash at the bottom of the table with both sides on 17 points, though Maritzburg United have a game in hand over their visitors. Each also has an eight-goal difference, suggesting there has not been much to separate these sides this season.Maritzburg have seen a welcome upturn in form of late and are unbeaten in their last four league games (W2 D2), but with just two wins from 10 at home this campaign (D3 L5), their lack of points at the Harry Gwala Stadium is a concern.There is no doubt that it has been home form which has kept them in the DStv Premiership during recent seasons in which they have struggled and if that falters then they are in real trouble.With 16 goals scored, only TTM (11) have netted fewer times this season, though they have looked much better defensively in recent weeks with two clean sheets and two goals conceded in those four unbeaten games.Chippa have been on a steady slide towards the foot of the table with no league wins in seven games (D4 L3). Their last victory was a 3-0 win at Black Leopards on January 23, while their previous home win was 3-1 against the self-same Maritzburg on November 3 when the teams last met.Their form has been slightly tempered by a run to the semifinals of the Nedbank Cup, where they will face second-tier Pretoria Callies and have an excellent chance of making a first ever cup final.A draw has been the most common result in matches between these sides, with Maritzburg leading the head-to-head 5-3 and seven stalemates. Chippa have only one win at their opponents, which was a 2-0 success in 2015.A win for either side would see them move four points clear of second-bottom TTM.BLACK LEOPARDS V AMAZULUBlack Leopards will hope the international break has given them a chance to regroup and refocus as they sit rock-bottom of the DStv Premiership with only three wins in their 20 games to date (D4 L13).Conversely, the break arguably came at a bad time for AmaZulu, who have seen their momentum broken, having been comfortably the form side in the DStv Premiership to that point.They have taken an impressive 22 points from the last 24 available in the league (W7 D1), an incredible testament to the work done by coach Benni McCarthy since he took over.It has seen the side catapult up the table and to within two points of second-placed Golden Arrows, with owner Sandile Zungu’s seemingly ambitious pre-season goal of a top-four finish very much on.But the arduous trip to Thohoyandou to face Leopards is never an easy one and McCarthy will be well aware of the pitfalls in this fixture.In fact, Usuthu have not won at Leopards since a 4-1 success in 2012, and have a recent defeat there in the Nedbank Cup when Lidoda Duvha claimed a 1-0 success on February 27. McCarthy will point out he made a raft of changes that day to give fringe players a run.The away team has not managed a goal in meetings between these two in any of the last four games, while there have been just four goals scored in that time too.BLOEMFONTEIN CELTIC V TS GALAXYBloemfontein Celtic are another side that have been on a steady slide down the DStv Premiership table with no wins in their previous five games (D3 L2).They host a Galaxy side who saw their good form end with a surprise 2-0 loss at home to Maritzburg United on March 20, though they are very much still in the hunt for a top eight place, which would be a major achievement for the club.They have certainly been much improved since the arrival of coach Owen da Gama, despite the loss last time out, and are unbeaten in their last five away games (W2 D3). Overall, they have lost only two of their 10 fixtures on the road this season (W2 D6). Those defeats came at Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City, both in December.Celtic have lost just once this season at home in the league (W5 D5), with all five draws ending 1-1. The single defeat was against Orlando Pirates (0-1) in November.Victory could take Celtic as high as ninth, above Kaizer Chiefs, while a win for Galaxy will see them move six points clear of the self-same AmaKhosi and put some daylight between themselves and ninth position.Galaxy won the reverse fixture in Mpumalanga 1-0 on February 24 as Lindo Mbatha got the only goal of the game. -SuperSport
