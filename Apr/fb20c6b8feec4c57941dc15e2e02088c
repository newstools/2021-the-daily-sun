A NURSE is fighting for her life in hospital after her car crashed into a tree lying in the road between New Forest and Arthurstone on Tuesday morning, 13 April. Angry villagers of Kumani near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga went on the rampage on Monday, 12 April and threw the tree into the road. They were demanding a bridge on the deadly Mutlumuvi River which cuts Thulamahashe off from Kumani village. They marched to Mpumalanga Department of Public Works in Thulamahashe, where newly-appointed MEC Mohita Latchminarain was supposed to address them. However, when they got to the office, all entrances were locked. They were demanding a new bridge, as the existing low-lying one was built by the former government about 60 years ago. They said during heavy rain people, including pupils, feared being swept away while trying to cross over to Thulamahashe.  They shut down Thulamahashe Plaza and the nearby mall, closed schools and barricaded roads with burnt tyres, poles and signboards. They also set fire to municipal skip rubbish bins and damaged traffic lights. Bushbuckridge Municipality spokesman Claiton Khosa said: “Firstly, the municipality is sympathising with the nurse involved in a car accident and wish her a speedy recovery. “The Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport has confirmed the bridge with a five kilometre road will be constructed in the 2021/22 financial year and is reflected in the municipal integrated development plan. We urge members of the community to be patient and refrain from all violent service delivery activities,” said Khosa. Police dispersed the crowd and investigations are underway.
