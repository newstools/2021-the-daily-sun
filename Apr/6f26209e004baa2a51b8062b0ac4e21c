SEKHUKHUNE United coach, MacDonald Makhubedu, has stepped up the mind games ahead of his side’s showdown against log leaders Richards Bay. The two sides square off on Sunday at Richards Bay Stadium (3pm). The Natal Rich Boyz head into this match sitting at the top of the log, with a four points gap between them and second place TS Sporting. Babina Noko, as Sekhukhune are known, started their maiden season in the GladAfrica Championship with promise, and they are currently sitting fourth, five points behind the Natal Rich Boyz. They are in good position to challenge for the title as the top six teams all still have a chance of finishing first and gaining automatic promotion to the DStv Premiership. However, when quizzed about their chances of catching up on Sunday, Makhubedu said: “We’re going there to try and win the game. We’re not even thinking about winning the league. We’re not in the title race. “The race is between Royal AM, TS Sporting, and Free State Stars, not us. “Also Polokwane City, we cannot rule them out. They are a strong side that can turn the tables in the remaining matches.” Makhubedu said the pressure is on their opponents. He stated: “We just want to win the remaining games and see how it ends. “Richards Bay are the ones who have been saying they want to win the league, so the pressure is on them not on our side. Even reaching promotion/relegation play-offs will be a huge achievement for us.” With six games remaining in the Championship, a lot could still happen as small margins separate the teams. Richards Bay star striker Khanyisa Mayo, son of former Kaizer Chiefs star Patrick, said they know that all the teams want to bring them down, but they are determined to keep going until the last game of the season. Said Mayo: “They are all coming to us guns blazing. For us, we need to maintain the four points gap and even extended it if the teams behind us slip up. “We are confident we can go all the way.”
