WHEN the sun sets, residents rush into their homes to stay safe. They’re keeping safe from the MaRussia gang, which has allegedly being terrorising them. But night time is the start of the night shift for local councillor Thabani Mngomezulu, a sangoma. He often receives calls from residents of Silver City in Bekkersdal whose lives are in danger, and he helps them as cops often don’t arrive on time. Using a loudspeaker, he drives around the kasi urging residents to contact the police when faced with trouble. Thabani believes his ancestors give him the power and guidance to defend himself and residents. “I speak to my ancestors and ask for their protection before I leave home,” he said. Speaking from his indumba, Thabani told Daily Sun he couldn’t sit idle while the area turned into a shooting range and innocent people dropped like flies. “I receive calls at night from helpless residents, and I can’t fold my arms while criminals take charge of our kasi. “They’re killing our brothers and sisters and some break into spaza shops. There’s bloodshed every week and many hide behind curtains.” Resident Ntsoaki Bodibe said they appreciated what Thabani is doing. “He uses a loudspeaker to tell us to hide under the bed if there are shootings. He’s trying hard to fight thugs who terrorise us,” she said. Residents Oupapa Ramaleba and Danny Masobela complained about a lack of mast lights in the area and asked the municipality to install them to alleviate crime. Acting station commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Andile Moshane, said there was an increase in the number of murders in the area. He advised people not to walk at night. Randwest MMC for infrastructure, Dumile Sithole, said the municipality will attend to the issue of mast lights raised by Danny and others.
