KAIZER Chiefs rarely head into any fixture with the underdog tag. But that’s exactly what the Soweto giants will be when they face Mamelodi Sundowns in a crunch DStv Premiership showdown at Loftus Stadium on Sunday (3pm). Amakhosi will be desperate for revenge after Downs humiliated them in the reverse fixture. The Tshwane side thumped Amakhosi 3-0 in an opening game of the season that would set the tone for the rest of the campaign. Since then, Downs have swatted aside just about every opponent put in front of them on their quest to defend their title. They are currently on course to achieving that goal as they currently hold a healthy six-point lead at the summit of the Premiership standings. The Glamour Boys, in contrast, have been a shadow of the team that went toe to toe with the Brazilians in the title race last season. They languish in 11th spot on the standings and are battling for a top-eight finish at the end of the season. Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has higher ambitions – a top-five finish – but his side would have to drastically improve their form. The 56-year-old serial winner has not lost hope, however, and believes a shock win against the Tshwane giants would set his side back on the right course. “We are in a very tough situation but we just have to look forward and try and finish the season well,” said Hunt on the back of yet another setback, a 2-1 loss at the hands of Cape Town City on Wednesday. “It’s going to be really tough now but it will also be tight. A lot of teams have to play each other, so a lot can still happen. There’s a lot of things we need to get right. We need to be better. That’s for sure,” he said.
