WHILE John Letsoalo saved up money for his wedding, his mum Caroline entered the Boxer Win a Wedding Competition. She never lost hope that one day she’d win. The 54-year-old from Mphakane Village in Botlokwa, Limpopo, was over the moon when she was recently announced as the winner. She walked away with R100 000, which her son John (33) and his bride Katlego Khunou (32) used towards their wedding. They tied the knot at South Gate Lodge in Polokwane on Sunday, 11 April. Caroline told Daily Sun she knew it would be hard for the couple to afford such a flashy wedding. “When I got the call from Boxer, I was happy that my wish for them to celebrate their dream wedding had finally come true,” said the mum. “I thank God for helping me win the competition because remember, I wasn’t doing it for myself, but for them,” she said. The wedding started at about 11am and not more than 200 people were accommodated in the outdoor venue. Pastor Moloko Kgwale of The Lord is My Shepherd Church presided over the ceremony. John thanked his mum for entering the competition on their behalf. “What she did for us is remarkable. It’s a very good story to tell and I appreciate her effort to make our dream come true,” he said. Katlego thanked Boxer and said they were grateful they made their dream wedding come true. “We wish the competition continues forever as there are more couples out there who want to have a wedding celebration like this one,” she said.
