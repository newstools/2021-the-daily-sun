ACTOR Mothusi Sengwatse has joined Mzansi Magic’s Rockville, where he will play Spijo. Mothusi told Daily Sun he was over the moon when he was told he got the role. “I was really happy that things are finally opening up, especially because it has been a year since I’ve been on screens,” he said. He described his character as naughty and carefree. “Spijo is not any different from my last character, and I’ve been enjoying breathing life into the character. I love how carefree and cheeky he is,” he said. “I don’t want to give away the whole story, but what I can assure you is that viewers are going to resonate well with him because of his backstory and the hardships he goes through. His storyline is amazing and it’s going to hit home for many.” Mothusi, who got his big break on The Throne, said he faced a difficult time after the show ended. “The first six months after the show ended were very difficult because things were quiet. “This is because when you are shooting a show for a year, you do not really think about what’s next because you are engulfed in the moment. I found myself without a plan on what to do next,” he said. “But starting a production company allowed me to keep the lights on and pay my rent while I try to find my feet again. It has also helped me grow as a writer and a producer.” Mothusi told the People’s Paper that he’s writing a movie. “When I’m not in front of the camera, I’m constantly creating. I’m currently writing a movie and this is about having longevity in the entertainment industry,” he said.
