PEOPLE from KwaNdebele want their station to stay in Tshwane or move to KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga – but it must not move to Auckland Park! Different organisations from KwaNdebele picketed outside SABC offices in Hatfield, Tshwane on Wednesday. According to Prince Vusi Mahlangu of the KwaNdebele tribe, there are rumours that the Ikwekwezi FM station will be moved from Tshwane. Mahlangu said they had to stand up and meet the SABC management. “As Ndebele people, we are not happy about the moving of the station,” he said. “This is undermining us and our language as we don’t live in Joburg. Mahlangu said they have a place in KwaMhlanga where the SABC will not even pay rent to have a station. He said they would be grateful if President Cyril Ramaphosa visited them in KwaNdebele. WATCH: MAGWINYA DOUGH SHOCK! His plea is for people and government to respect Ndebele culture. Mahlangu said the Kingships of KwaNdebele are not respected. “We need Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu to be given more respect like other comrades.” Moloto Rail Corridor representative Nelisiwe Masilela (28) said they have been at the Union Buildings since September, and Ramaphosa has not responded to their grievances. “We need to improve transportation as a priority and reduce deaths on our roads. We need rails to ease travel,” she said. Vuka Kusile organisation member Collen Mnguni (24) said: “We want Ikwekwezi FM in KwaMhlanga and to be given respect as AmaNdebele.” Thando Mahlangu of Ndebele Cultural Activist said: “I’m not happy about their decision. Ikwekwezi FM must go back to KwaMhlanga.” Acting SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo: “It must be noted that the decision to consider relocating SABC’s Pretoria office to Auckland Park is part of the cost-saving initiatives. In addition, to ensure that the Ndebele people are adequately served accordingly, the SABC’s news division will continue to maintain a presence in Pretoria.”
