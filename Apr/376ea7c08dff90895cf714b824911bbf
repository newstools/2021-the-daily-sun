The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) is working
with teams in three provinces to determine the cause of an upsurge in Covid-19
cases. In a statement on Wednesday, the NICD said there had been an
upsurge of cases in the Northern Cape, North West and Free State. "The team is working with the respective provinces to
ascertain whether the rise in cases can be attributed to cluster outbreaks and
recommend increased testing and contact tracing to contain the situation and
limit further spread," said Dr Harry Moultrie, senior epidemiologist at
the NICD. In the latest NICD numbers, the Free State has the
second-highest number of new cases in the country at 129, followed by the
Northern Cape with 128. The North West recorded 105 new cases. Most new cases were recorded in Gauteng with 245. Last month, several schools in the Calvinia area in the
Northern Cape were closed after a cluster outbreak. "We want to reassure the South African public that we
are actively monitoring the situation in these provinces and will keep the
community informed of any new developments," said Professor Adrian Puren,
the NICD's acting executive director. Moultrie said as the April school holiday season starts, it
is important for people to follow non-pharmaceutical measures like wearing
masks and social distancing to minimise transmission of the virus. SOURCE: NEWS24 https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/nicd-concerned-as-three-provinces-see-covid-19-upsurge-20210421
