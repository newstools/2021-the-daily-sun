BAROKA midfielder Kgodiso Monama says they will show no fear when face Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in their DStv Premiership encounter at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Thursday (3pm). The 23-year-old believes the Limpopo based-side who are fighting to end this season in the top eight are capable of upsetting Amakhosi to boost their chance of playing in the MTN8 competition next season. Baroka are 12th on the log with 23 points from 21 games. Chiefs, who have been struggling in their league campaign this season under the four times Premiership winning coach Gavin Hunt, are ninth only a point ahead of Bakgaga. A win for Baroka could see them moving in the 8th spot. “Everyone knows that Chiefs are a big team, but we are not scared of them,” said Monama. “We have set ourselves a goal and to achieve that we have to win games. We are in the top flight because we deserve to be here and we do not fear any team. And why should we be scared of them? He added: “All we have to do is to give our best and make sure we get three points on Thursday. It won’t be an easy game as Chiefs are also fighting to end the season in the top eight. We are playing at home and I believe we are capable of upsetting them (Chiefs).” The last time Baroka faced Hunt’s charges they were unlucky not to win after midfielder Goodman Mosele scored an own goal in the 77th minute to help Chiefs earn a point in the match that ended 1-1 in January. On Thursday, the Ga-Mphahlele based-side will miss the services of goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze and midfielder Nhlanhla Mgaga due to suspension. Baroka coach Thoka Matsimela told SunSport that he is not worried about the duo as they have a big squad with players capable of replacing them. “It is true as a coach you need all your players,” said Matsimela. “But in this case, there is nothing we can do and we cannot worry as these players will be back after the Chiefs game. I would have been worried if they were injured.”
