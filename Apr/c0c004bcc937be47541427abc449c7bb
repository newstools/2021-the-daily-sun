THE petrol price has skyrocketed in Mzansi over the past few months. But by the looks of things, we are about to be saved by the Bajaj Qute aka the “Chipi” after it trended on social media. In a video that went viral, a man who has just bought a white Bajaj Qute can be seen inspecting it and the person taking the video encouraging him that he’s done well for himself. The man can be heard saying this is a German machine, a “Chipi” – the kasi term for a good car.
