Controversial couple, Bongekile "Babes Wodumo" Simelane and Mandla 'Mampintsha' Maphumulo tied the knot over the past weekend. They got blessings from many people except Mampintsha's mum. In a video doing rounds on social media, Mampintsha's mum vented her anger. She started by clarifying that she was Mampintsha's mum who carried him for nine months. "After that, I'm being controlled by this new makoti. She said we shouldn't come to their wedding, we will only come to their white wedding. I want to know how can they get married without us." At traditional weddings, families usually exchange gifts. Mampintsha's mum asked, "Who are you giving gifts to if not me, I don't know." She said she won't be ruled by Babes Wodumo because she is still begging for marriage. She accused her of faking her pregnancy. "She must give birth so we see. She put sponges in her tummy. She must give birth to the twins she said she was carrying." "I am asking for God to protect my Mandla from the devil he's in love with." Among other things she said was that Babes was a loose girl who will give birth to a cat. "I don't need this woman Mandla has married. I'm saying this in public. I have never started with her, she is the one who always starts with me." She said they are only seven in her family and Babes Wodumo couldn't bear with only seven people. The mother, whose speech suggested being drunk, also accused Babes Wodumo's parents of many things. The couple tied their knot in a joyous traditional wedding in KZN. This is after they got engaged in October last year. Rumours were flying that the pair were expecting their first child, but there has been no official statement made on this matter.
