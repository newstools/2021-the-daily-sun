I’m concerned by the poor services we get at our post offices countrywide. The services are very poor and the buildings also appear to be poorly maintained. In most post offices, you get one teller servicing many, many customers. Our elderly citizens, who’re the ones mostly using the post office for collecting their grants, are suffering as they have to stand in the queues for long hours. I’ve seen gogos sitting on concrete floors because there are not enough chairs for them to sit on. Our government is really playing games with us. This must change and we need to see the services being improved before someone dies while standing in those long queues.
