MARITZBURG United will attempt to become the first club to beat Orlando Pirates in a league match at Orlando Stadium in three years when the two sides meet this evening (6.30pm). The Team of Choice wants to maintain their five-game unbeaten run in the league. In their last DStv Premiership game, Maritzburg thumped Chippa United 5-1 to record the team’s biggest win in the PSL era. Pirates are currently fifth with 35 points on the log after 21 games, but could jump to fourth spot on the table. On the other hand, Maritzburg are 13 on the log with 20 points after 20 games. The Team of Choice have won their last two matches to completely move out of the bottom. In fact, they have won three and drawn two of their last five league matches. Maritzburg midfielder Travis Graham said they aim to keep their good form intact. “We’ve had a good run of form and it is really important to keep this going. The boys are hungry to get maximum points,” said Graham. “We do understand and realise we are still at the bottom half of the table. By getting good results in this match, it will really be a big boost for us. I know the guys are motivated to keep this form going.” Maritzburg face a Pirates side that has not lost at Orlando Stadium in 37 league games. Their last loss was against Bidvest Wits in May 2018 (1-0). They have won 21 and drawn 16 of those matches.  Today’s game was rescheduled, following a postponement earlier this month as Pirates had to honour their Caf Confederation Cup fixture against Al Ahli of Libya. But the PSL decided to host it today after Pirates were knocked out the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals Mamelodi Sundowns on Thursday.
