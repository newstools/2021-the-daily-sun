NOMALANGA Nkosi (55) told Daily Sun she was born with special powers but is living in fear. “I have the power of being isithunywa,” said Nomalanga from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni. The woman, who said she can see what other people don’t and was sent by the ancestors to perform certain tasks, claimed certain people wanted to turn her into a zombie. “I’m sometimes followed. But because I’m protected they’re not able to achieve their mission. I want those people to leave me alone,” she said. “When I hear voices talking and footsteps outside my house at night, I pray and the ancestors protect me.” Nomalanga said she’s an isithunywa operating through prayer. She said her powers are meant to bring good things to people chosen by the ancestors. But Nomalanga said some people hunt izithunywa for their selfish ends. “They want my powers to enrich themselves and use them in evil ways, like appeasing devils to get earthly wealth.” She said some of those people are izinyanga and spiritual leaders. When Daily Sun entered Nomalanga’s house, a Bible was on a small coffee table. “I use the Bible and my ancestors are always with me,” she said. Nomalanga said it’s not easy to understand her calling and others thought she’s crazy. “I was born with this gift, and my ancestors always use me to do good for the needy,” she said. Sangoma Makhosi Ndlela said being isithunywa is like being a messenger. “Some operate through water, others through herbs, and others use prayer. Sometimes all the skills are mixed.”
