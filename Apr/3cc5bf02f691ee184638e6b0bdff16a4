ZODWA Wabantu has once again caused a stir on social media. This time, she shocked social media users when she accidentally dropped a purse full of ARV pills. While some were shocked, others were amused and the video started a debate, with many people breaking their silence about HIV. And it seems that’s exactly what the media personality wanted when she shared the video. Zodwa told Daily Sun she wanted to encourage people to use ARVs unashamedly. “I have embarked on a campaign to end the stigma associated with taking ARVs.” Some social media users shared their HIV status and that taking ARVs helped them stay alive and healthy. Zodwa told Daily Sun being HIV-positive didn’t mean the end of the world. “People live many years with the virus. If you find that you are positive, never lose hope, but take your medication correctly and live happily.” She said people should never leave their ARVs behind, even when they went out. “Take them with you and when it’s time to take them, do that without shame. “It’s your life.” Zodwa said whoever laughed at someone for being HIV-positive was crazy. “Those kind of people need to be educated thoroughly and we will use everything possible to teach them,” she said.
