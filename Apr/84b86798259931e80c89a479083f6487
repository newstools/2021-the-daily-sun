WHEN you hear the song Re Bafiti by Joseph Dumako on a Sunday morning on Motsweding FM, you know that Brown Mosiapoa is on air and is about to preach. Together with Moruti Lebogang Tube, Brown – also known as Di Bruin – is co-host of Rorisang between 6am and 9am. The popular duo keep listeners cheerful through their preaching style. More than 1,2 million listeners tune in any given Sunday. Brown brings families together and close the space of those who do not have churches or unable to go to the church on that particular Sunday.“Rorisang is a religious show that speaks about gender-based violence and the scripture,” he said. “It encourages people to listen to and implement the word of God. The presenter from Perth Village in Kuruman, Northern Cape, said his show kicks off with a 20-minute preaching ceremony by Bishop Daniel Matebesi. “It’s followed by Moruti Tube in the second and third hour when we preach, motivate and interact with listeners.” Brown, who’s been presenting the show for the past five years, took over from legend Timothy Modisane, aka Modisane Modise. He’s won two Crown Gospel Music Awards in the Best Gospel Radio show category for two years in a row, in 2019 and 2020.
