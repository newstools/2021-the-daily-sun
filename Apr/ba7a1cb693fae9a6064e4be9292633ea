HUMAN Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said changing lives is a priority in her ministry. But the migration of people seeking better opportunities would continue to create a housing backlog. She indicated they were chasing a moving target. “At the moment there are 3 000 informal settlements in the country and are mainly concentrated in metropolitan areas such as eThekwini, Tshwane, Joburg and Cape Town. “It’s for this reason that these cities are allocated a budget to respond to these informal settlements through the Informal Settlements Upgrading Programme,” she said. In her 2020/2021 budget vote speech, Sisulu indicated the department, together with the provinces, would work with communities and municipalities to upgrade over 300 squatter campos and improve the living conditions of households. She said R2,4 billion and R2,2 billion were allocated for provinces and metros for this purpose. “Our current delivery stats show that since 1994, we’ve delivered over 3 391 264 housing units, 1 237 952 serviced sites and 375 643 Enhanced Extended Discount Benefit Scheme,” she said. She acknowledged still much more needed to be done. “The evidence of what we have achieved as a nation in changing the lives of our people is out there for everyone to see. “We will be happy when we have reached out to everyone. That is our resolve,” said Sisulu.
