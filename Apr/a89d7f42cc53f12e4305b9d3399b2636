SEKHUKHUNE United failed to extend the gap at the top of the GladAfrica Championship when they were held to a goalless draw by Royal AM on Wednesday afternoon. Despite not getting maximum points, Sekhukhune remains at the top of the log standings with 35 points, the same as second place Richards Bay FC, who have also amassed 35points after 20 matches. The positive goal difference only separates the two sides. Sekhukhune coach McDonald Makhubedu said he was satisfied by his player's displays despite failing to convert the chances they created on the match. "It was a god game, two good teams gave their all. We had our chances and they had their chances I am happy with the boys showing. We will take a point ad move forward to the next match," said Makhubedu after the match.
