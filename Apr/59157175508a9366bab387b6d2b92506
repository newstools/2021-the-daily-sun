AFRICANS don’t learn from the past, which is why we repeat mistakes we could have avoided. What’s happening in Mozambique is nothing new but is something that’s been rearing its ugly head in parts of our continent for decades. But, due to the fact that we only act after impact, it comes with dire consequences. The problem of Mozambique is inequality, marginalisation, poverty and many other socio-economic factors that should have been dealt with a long time ago, before the poor are manipulated to take up arms and fight for what they believe is a good cause. Fixing problems after impact is very costly and takes time. In South Africa, we are heading in the same direction as Mozambique, and many other African countries because we fail to take a leaf from case studies we see on this continent. Now my challenge is for every citizen who loves Mzansi to take a stand and save this country from being another failed state of Africa. Our beloved ANC is taking us into that direction. Corruption has become another name for South Africa, while the majority of people are living below the breadline. I’m one of the many unemployed graduates who invested their time and limited resources to get a higher education, only to sit and idle as a result of corruption and nepotism. To save this country, let’s vote this corrupt government out.
