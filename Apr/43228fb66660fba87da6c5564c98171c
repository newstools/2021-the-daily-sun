WHEN Sergeant Itumeleng Molatane reported for duty on Monday, 19 April, she never thought she’d act as a midwife. The 39-year-old stationed at Bethal in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun a resident who’d gone to the police station to certify documents alerted them to a woman crying for help next to the station’s entrance. Molatane went outside to check and found Kizabukidi Tony (35) about to go into labour. She was with her partner and sister. They were on their way to hospital. Molatane, who was with off-duty Constable Tilane Lebitsa, said she asked her colleague to get a blanket from her room. “When she returned a bouncing baby boy was already delivered,” she said. Molatane, who’s been a cop for 14 years, said this was the first time she delivered a baby. BANTITI STOLE MY HEART! “I was scared, but I prayed to God to help us and save both souls,” she said. After delivering the baby, Molatane took the mother and baby to hospital, where they were assessed and declared healthy. Kizabukidi said she was expecting her baby in May. She told the People’s Paper she had back pain and thought of walking to the hospital. “The pain got worse when I was close to the police station and I couldn’t walk any further. “We tried to stop cars, but no one stopped to help. “I laid down and noticed an officer next to me. “I’m grateful for her humility. I don’t know how to thank her.”
