VINCENT Pule was the star of the show for Orlando Pirates as they claw their way up the DStv Premiership table. The 28-year-old scored twice to help Bucs beat Maritzburg United 2-0 at Orlando Stadium on Sunday. His goals saw Pirates displace Swallows FC from fourth place on the standings as they look to edge closer to the leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. He proved to be a super-sub, as he has been of late, coming in and swinging what was a tight game in Pirates’ favour. He latched on to a Fortune Makaringe cross to break the deadlock in the 59th minute. His second was slightly more fortunate after Team of Choice goalkeeper Marcel Engelhardt made a huge blunder. The keeper rushed out to head away a Wayne Sandilands goal kick but he miscued his header leaving Pule clear on goal. Pule, however, was not the only livewire for Bucs as man of the match Thabiso Sesane took his rare opportunity with both hands. The youngster was rock solid at the back alongside Ntsikelelo Nyauza in the absence of captain Happy Jele. “The supporters are happy, the technical team is happy and so are the players,” Sesane told SuperSport TV after the match. Pirates bounced back from a 4-1 thumping at the hands of Sundowns in the Nedbank Cup on Thursday. They next face ES Setif in a Caf Confederations Cup at the same venue on Wednesday (3pm).
