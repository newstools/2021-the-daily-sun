A SHACK fire that broke out in Marikana Squatter Camp in Cato Crest, Durban, on Sunday morning claimed one life, injured a teenager and left several residents homeless. Resident Thanduxolo Scwebu said the fire broke out in the shack of Nomasamson Dlamini (38), who lived alone. “Her shack is just next to mine. We were woken by my 16-year-old son Cebolenkosi, who had burnt on the head, arms and legs. We managed to pull him out while we screamed, alerting other dwellers they needed to wake up because the squatter camp was on fire,” said Thanduxolo. He said even though they managed to survive, Nomasamson from Lesotho wasn’t so lucky.  “She had locked herself inside her shack, so it was difficult for us to help her come out. She screamed for help until the screams faded away,” said Thanduxolo. He said they didn’t know what may have caused the fire but suspected it could have been electric cables. He said among the things they lost was their furniture, clothes, food as well as documents such as IDs and birth certificates.  Zanele Juqu, who lived with her two daughters and two grandkids, said they didn’t know how they were going to recover from the situation. “Last night we slept in the open. Other dwellers gave us duvets that we put on the ground. We had to make fire a metre away from the duvets just so we could get warm.” Zanele said they didn’t have money to rebuild their shacks, nor did they have money to buy food. “We rely on buying vetkoeks just so we won’t sleep on empty stomachs.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket was being investigated by Cato Manor police. “Allegedly, on Sunday at 3.55am at Cato Crest, a total of 45 shacks caught fire. A 38-year-old woman was burnt and died. The cause of fire is unknown. The matter is still under investigation.”
