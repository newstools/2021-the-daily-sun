MATSHIDISO Mokone (50) ran into the burnt remains of her shack and checked under the charred mattress – and found that her life savings of R10 500 were also burnt. All her money had been partly burnt, with some notes completely destroyed. Matshidiso from Phomolong, Mamelodi East had worked piece jobs and sometimes went for a long time without an income. She was saving for when she was inbetween piece jobs. She managed to save the money over a few years, and would put some in when she worked and take some out as she needed. Her mattress was her bank.

We cook and bathe here. There’s no room. It’s just shelter over our heads,” she added. Matshidiso pleaded with SunReaders for help. “I’m a hard worker who doesn’t like begging, but I’m desperate. Until I get the money back, I can’t provide for my family,” she said. “We need food, clothes and another shack.”
