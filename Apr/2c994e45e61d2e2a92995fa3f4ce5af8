COVID-19 has indeed brought about a new normal. From how we socialise to how we work, this pandemic has really got the globe spinning on a different axis. Speaking about work, companies all over the world have shifted their offices to the digital platform. Many of their employees are now working from the comfort of their own homes, which means they are constantly on their laptops and cellphones. According to medical experts, this new working arrangement has left a lot of people suffering from what they call screen fatigue. Often referred to as eye strain, screen fatigue is a common condition that occurs when your eyes get tired from staring at computer screens and other digital devices. The symptoms include dry and burning eyes, headache, sore neck and shoulders. Experts further explain that screen fatigue also involves psychological symptoms such as tiredness and exhaustion from focusing on a screen, and the frustration that comes along with having your video camera on and meeting with people virtually constantly. According to medium.com, here are some ways of dealing with screen fatigue: 1. Use the Pomodoro method when working/studying. This involves looking away from your screen during the breaks to give your eyes a chance to rest. 2. Reach out for help. Seek professional help if you are really struggling with the psychological symptoms. 3. Change your bingeing habit. If youâ€™re used to Netflix and chill on a laptop, try switching things up to the bigger screen.
