  According to Al Ahly director of football Sayed Abdel-Hafiz, Mosimane is going nowhere.  Safa are understood to be courting Mosimane for the vacant Bafana Bafana position.  But they are unlikely to get their wish if Abdel-Hafiz’s statement is anything to go by.  “Al Ahly haven’t received anything official regarding Pitso Mosimane,” Abdel-Hafiz told Kingfut.  “Mosimane has settled his future and confirmed that he will continue with Al Ahly in the upcoming period,” he added.  Bafana are without a coach since Safa axed Molefi Ntseki. With the World Cup qualifiers looming, the football association are under pressure to find a coach.
