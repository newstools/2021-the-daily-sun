A TRAFFIC inspector (39) arrested for alleged corruption is scheduled to appear in the Barberton Magistrates Court on Monday, 26 April in Mpumalanga. The inspector, who’s attached to Kabokweni Cost Centre, was arrested by the Hawks serious corruption investigation team on Friday, 23 April. Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman, Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, said: “It’s alleged that on Thursday, 30 January the complainant was driving a company truck loaded at the back along Badplaas and Barberton road when he was stopped by the traffic officials. “It’s further alleged the traffic officer searched the truck and told the complainant he’s not allowed to load people at the back of the truck.” Sekgotodi said the traffic officer allegedly removed the disc and demanded R1 500 in order for him to return the disc. “The complainant didn’t have money at the time and the traffic officer promised him he’d get the disc back as soon as he brought the money. “The matter was reported to the Hawks in Nelspruit, which led to the arrest of the suspect on Friday.”
