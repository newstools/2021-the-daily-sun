ACTORS who usually appear as extras on various TV productions are planning a massive march over low wages. The angry actors have opened a WhatsApp group, which they called Board of Extras Asc. They share how unsatisfied they are about the low payment rates they get from some of Mzansi’s big productions. The actors said they feel used and exploited by the production houses. They revealed the money they earn per call rate ranges from R150 to R300.

But actors from other provinces said they’d stage small marches to show solidarity. One group member named Naledi said they are not only complaining about salaries, but treatment as well. “Most times extras aren’t catered for when it comes to food on set, and if so we eat actors’ leftovers. “Actors are not paid enough. We bring our own clothes on set. We also need to provide our own transport. There are so many challenges we face but we say, ‘Enough is enough’.” The group was created by Becky Dube, who owns Becky Casting Agency. She created the group to help extras voice out their concerns.
