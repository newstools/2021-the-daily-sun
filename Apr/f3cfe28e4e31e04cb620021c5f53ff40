  Hundreds and hundreds of mourners came to pay their
last respect to the eight-year-old Israella Bushiri. Her funeral was held in Ntcheu Boma in Malawi on
Thursday afternoon. Those who couldn't join in viewed the funeral ceremony
on the Enlighten Christian gatherings church online platforms. While observing the COVID-19 regulations, many people
attended the funeral while standing outside the venue. Some of the people who attended the prestigious
ceremony were London-based Zimbabwean ambassador, Prophet Uebert Angel. He and his wife came from London to console the
Bushiris.  It is also reported the Malawian president, Lazarus
Chakwera, made a heavy donation of money to the grieving self-proclaimed
Prophet Sheperd Bushiri and his wife Mary to help with the funeral
preparations. While paying his final respects, Bushiri expressed his
disappointment and said that everyone was going to miss the aura that often
surrounded his daughter. Israella reportedly succumbed to a lung infection
after spending weeks in hospital. Bushiri believes his daughter would still be alive if
she had been allowed to travel for medical assistance.
