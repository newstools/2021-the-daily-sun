Covid-19 has brought about numerous changes in our lives. From our health, our social lives and evidently our fashion sense. While many of us are stuck behind computers and are social distancing at home. The truth of the matter is that how we dress has drastically changed in the last year. Just think about it for a moment: When last did you rock that designer outfit or dressed up for an occasion? If you had to scratch your head for an answer then I rest my case. With winter upon us and working from home whilst keeping socially distant is the new norm. Fashion experts have put together some doable tips to keep your fashion sense trendy during these cold weather patterns. Letâ€™s take a look a few of these tips: 1. Leather of the cold weather No wardrobe is complete without a leather jacket. This cool wear is always handy in all seasons, and it can be a warm complement to your outfit during the winter. 2. Invest in high boots Got a pair of killer over-the-knee-boots? Winter is the perfect time to let them shine! This cosy look can be matched with a pair of jeans or a jumper for a more casual outfit, or try a skirt or mini dress and go out on an elegant night. Low temperatures are no excuse for going out with a dull wearing. 3. Get the layering of your clothes right Thick and heavy clothes will keep you warm in winter, but whenever you enter an air-conditioned room you'll be over-clothed and uncomfortable. Wearing several layers of clothes will solve this problem and also allow you to match your outfit better.
