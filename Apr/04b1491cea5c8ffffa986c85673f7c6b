AWARD-WINNING rapper AKA has arrived in Durban for the funeral of his late fiancee Anele “Nelli” Tembe. The funeral will be held on Friday. The Finessin’ hitmaker arrived on Wednesday morning and this was confirmed to Daily Sun by his publicist, Pumza Nohashe. “Kiernan is doing as well as can be expected, under the circumstances,” she said. “He lost the love of his life, someone he had taken advanced steps, culturally, to spend the rest of his life with.” Pumza said the rapper is taking it one step at a time, but the support of his family as well as counselling to deal with the grief has helped him greatly. “He is still trying to make sense of it all and is leaning on his mother Lynne and father Tony who, have been by his side. The love and support of Anele’s family and a grief counsellor have been of some relief to him.” ALSO READ | 'AKA IS INCONSOLABLE' Nelli died on Sunday, 11 April after she allegedly jumped out of a hotel building.
