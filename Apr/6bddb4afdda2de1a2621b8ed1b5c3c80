THE Piet Retief Magistrates Court heard yesterday that one of the Coka brothers was shot execution style. Amos and Zenzele Coka brothers were murdered allegedly by four farmers and a security guard at Pampoenkraal farm in Mpumalanga on 9 April. Investigating officer Warrant Officer Vukile Nhlapho told the court Amos Coka (36) was driving home when he was stopped by two people who were asking for help. They apparently told him their friend was kidnapped and assaulted allegedly by the farmers. Nhlapo said Coka drove up to where Nhlanhla Hlatshwayo was kept, but was denied access. He said when Coka arrived at the Greyling premises, he was told by farm workers to leave the area because he would be killed and accused of trespassing. Nhlapho said Coka drove back to his place and found two vehicles blocking the entrance to his home. The cop said Coka noticed Hlatshwayo lying bleeding under a tree. “He was determined to open the gate by force but accused number 3 allegedly punched him in the face and gunshots were fired. Coka was shot in the back and the bullet came out through the front. “He fell, and the accused came closer and shot him in the head at close range while he was lying on the ground,” he said Nhlapho said Coka was not carrying anything as both his hands were balled into fists. Daniel Malan (38), Orchard Kligenberg (58), Cornelius Greyling (26), Othard Klingenberg (58), Ignatius Steynberg (31) and Zenzele Yende are facing charges of kidnapping, attempted murder, two counts of murder and defeating the ends of justice. Prosecutor Robert Molokoane said more charges would be added. The matter was postponed to Monday, 26 April.
