ALL her life gogo wanted seven different colours of food on her plate and that’s why she has lived to be 101 years old! According to her family, after such a meal with many vegetables, gogo washed it down with a Coke. The children and friends of Roseline Ndlovu celebrated her birthday on Saturday in Stinkwater, Tshwane. Rebecca Sibisi (74) said her mother loved hard work and planting vegetables. Until she was injured in a violent robbery, she still swept the yard every day. “She loves chicken, rice, pumpkin, carrots, beetroot and, of course, her Coke.” She was born in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, and lived in Mamelodi before moving in with family in Stinkwater. “Our ancestors must continue protecting her from evil,” said Rebecca. “I’m happy to still have my mother. This is a blessing from God.” Gogo Roseline’s mother, a sangoma, lived until she was 110. “My mum believes in God and ancestors and loves her kids,” said Rebecca. Grandchild Goitsemang Ndlovu (20) said her gogo is full of love. “We pray that God will give her many more years,” she said. Goitsemang thanked the ANC for organising the party. ANC Women’s League member Thembi Mmoko (65) said gogo is a imbokodo. “She’s always taught us about unity and loving our neighbours,” she said. Ward 95 chairman Justice Mahlangu said: “She’s dedicated to the ANC.” MK veteran Moses Moyo said they wished the country’s president would organise a big party for her. “We’re celebrating this special day with her,” he said. Roseline had 10 kids, four of whom died. She has 38 grandkids, 41 great-grandkids and 18 great-great-grandkids. The family is appealing for a wheelchair to help gogo as she’s no longer able to walk.
