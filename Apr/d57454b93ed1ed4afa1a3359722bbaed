MASKANDI artists Sibusiso “Bahubhe” Mkhize and Syanda “Lagxabha” Hadebe have been barred from performing at the Durban Workshop. This after the two artists fought. Bahubhe told Daily Sun that he was informed by board members that he was no longer allowed to perform at the workshop. “This follows an incident where I was attacked by Lagxabha. Board members felt it was risky to allow us to perform there,” said Bahubhe. However, he said he appealed to the board and was given a warning. “I explained my side of the story and they understood. As it is, I’m back at the workshop performing as normal. I understand that maskandi fights put not just our lives at risk, but even those of our fans.” According to Bahubhe, Lagxabha allegedly gave him a hot klap. “I’m not sure how the fight broke out because I wasn’t there. I received a call informing me that Lagxabha had been attacked. From what I was told, my name was in the middle of the argument between Lagxabha and his attackers. “I then rushed to the workshop, and the fight was still on. When I asked Lagxabha the cause, he attacked me,” said Bahubhe. He said he did not retaliate – he left. “I could have opened a case against him, but decided not to. I thought we should resolve the issue amicably.” Board member Bless Ntuli said: “We decided not to allow Lagxabha and Bahubhe to perform at the workshop because of their ongoing fight. “Our decision is based on the fact that the Durban Workshop is a public place, and allowing them to come will put the lives of their fans at risk. However, they both appealed our decision and we allowed them to continue using the workshop, but on strict conditions.” Tensions between the two have been brewing for some time. Last time, Lagxabha accused Bahubhe of being jealous of his success. When Daily Sun called Lagxabha for a comment, his phone rang unanswered.
