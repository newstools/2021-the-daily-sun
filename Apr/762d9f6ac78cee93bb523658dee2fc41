WESTERN Cape Transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela has warned travellers to be safe from both Covid-19 and accidents as they travel during Easter. He said the virus doesn’t stop because it’s Easter, so visitors must remain on high alert. “I want to warmly welcome travellers to our province and remind them that Covid-19 hasn’t gone on holiday,” said Madikizela. “Every single person must be on high alert so they don’t get infected with Covid-19 or spread Covid-19 infection during their stay. “It’s also important to remember that just like any year we have to make sure we arrive safely at our destinations. “We must all make sure that we practise good driver behaviour, comply with road rules, stay within the legal speed limit, and observe adequate rest periods during travel in order to avoid fatigue.” Madikizela said this during the launch of his department’s Easter holiday operations on the N1 on Wednesday. He said driving under the influence is one of the major causes of crashes. Starting on Thursday, 1 April, Madikizela said traffic cops will be on the road ensuring drivers are not breaking the law. He said operations will focus on, among other things, driver and vehicle fitness, alcohol enforcement, fatigue management, moving violations and freight movement and overload control. He said traffic cops will also look into farmworker safe transportation, seat belt compliance for all vehicle occupants, speed and pedestrian safety. “My officers will intensify their activities and will harshly enforce the law in relation to those who drive on our roads while under the influence. As a society, every one of us should take personal responsibility for our own behaviour as road users,” he said.
