GATVOL artists have intensified their call for the removal of Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa. They chanted “Nathi must go!” as they entered the 35th day of their picket in front of the National Arts Council offices in Newtown, Jozi. Artists have been up in arms since reports surfaced alleging that R300 million was misappropriated. The funds were allotted to artists so they could find sustainable jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking at the gathering, protest leader Brian Ntombela said they won’t rest until they get what was rightfully theirs. “We won’t back down, even if they use police to intimidate us because we’re going hungry as a result of their greed,” he said. “They must also hand over the keys to the NAC offices so artists can have full access to the facilities.” He said some artists applied for funding and signed contracts, but when time came to receive funding they either got a fraction thereof or nothing. Visual artist Slovo Mamphaga said he relied on the funding, for which he’d applied. “It’s been tough for artists because when we applied for the funding, we thought we’d get it but didn’t. Instead, the money was misused and we’re struggling,” he said. Ntombela said the song, Nathi Must Go, would be released next week and would be available for download so their call is taken seriously. He said the struggle song is about a fight for artists’ rights. NAC and the Department of Arts and Culture had not responded to our questions by the time of going to print.
