PROTEAS coach Mark Boucher is not overly concerned about the
public criticism of his team’s horrible run of results. The Proteas have been battling to lift themselves from
the mediocrity of the past two years, seen as they lost the recent One Day
International and the T20 series against Pakistan. Even though he has taken responsibility for the terrible
results, Boucher, however, has stuck to his guns, reasoning he has faith and
trust in the plans he has in place to turn around their poor form. “I take a massive amount of responsibility,” said
Boucher. “I don’t shy away from it and I have never shied away
from something like that. “I am extremely hurt, just as is the rest of my
management and coaching staff. We have put a lot of work and effort into this
and it’s not time to panic yet. “If I worried about public opinion and that type of
stuff‚ I probably would have hanged myself a long time ago.
