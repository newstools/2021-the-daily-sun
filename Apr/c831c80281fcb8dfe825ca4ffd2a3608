THE building manager’s duty was to attend to the tenants’ needs, but apparently, the 45-year-old felt the need to render more than just housekeeping services at a Joburg flat. Now the man is hot water after he was bust for raping an ex-tenant in one of the flats he managed. Joburg Central cops arrested him on 26 April at 7pm. This was after the man allegedly raped a 29-year-old woman after asking her to come see him. His crime of passion allegedly took place on 23 April at 9pm at Asmar Flats in the Joburg CBD. Captain Xoli Mbele told Daily Sun the victim used to live there, but moved out. “The building manager phoned her to come and see him. When she arrived, he forced himself on her, repeatedly raping her.” Mbele said investigations were underway and the suspect would appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court soon. Joburg Central station commander Brigadier Ivan Perumal commended the police’s swift response that led to the man’s arrest.
