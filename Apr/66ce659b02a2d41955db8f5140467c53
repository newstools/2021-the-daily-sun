A 28-year-old man accused of raping and killing Nomcebo Khumalo (14) briefly appeared in the Mayflower Magistrates Court on Thursday, 1 April. He was not asked to plead to the charges. The court remanded him in custody until 16 April for further investigations and formal bail application. Residents who came to support the murdered victim’s family protested outside court carrying placards opposing bail for the accused. Protest leader Derrick Mhlanga told Daily Sun that the residents were angry over the girl’s brutal murder.  “We came here to support the victim’s family. We will be here until the matter is finalised. We are opposing his bail as we want him to rot in jail. He raped and killed a young future leader of this country,” said Derrick. The family’s spokesman, Dumisane Yende, said they were hurt and disturbed by Nomcebo’s horrible murder. “Nomcebo was sent to buy dye for paint at a shop not far from home. We became worried when she did not come back home. We went to check her at the shop but the shop owner told us she left right after buying the dye,” said Dumisane. Nomcebo’s uncle Bonginkosi Khumalo (29) said they searched for Nomcebo in vain. This was until he went to relief himself in the bushes one day when he was greeted by his niece’s naked body with her pants next to her. “We reported the matter to the police. This killer robbed us of an angel. We want justice take its course,” said Bonginkosi.
