WHEN actor, Khaya Dladla, left his role as GC on SABC1’s Uzalo, the show’s ardent viewers were left disappointed. But the actor is returning tonight, 6 April, to reprise his highly popular role. In a previous interview with Daily Sun, the star said he was excited to be back on the show and it’s finally happening. Tonight will mark his return, which will be followed by the return of his co-stars, Nay Maps and TK Dlamini, who will reprise their roles as Mxolisi and Mastermind. Announcing the news of his return on his Instagram account, Khaya said he had decided to answer the prayers of his fans, who had been asking him when he was returning to the award-winning show. “You have been asking when this day is going to come. Stained Glass Productions and SABC1 have decided to answer your prayers. Thank you for the love and support in this journey, it humbles me,” he wrote.
