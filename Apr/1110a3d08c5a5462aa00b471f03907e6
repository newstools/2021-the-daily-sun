THE police in Bela-Bela, Limpopo are investigating a case of murder and an inquest after an on-duty traffic cop allegedly shot and killed his girlfriend (30) before turning the gun on himself. The tragedy was discovered on Sunday by a passing motorist who stopped next to the vehicle along the R101 outside Bela-Bela, apparently thinking the woman lying on the ground was a crash victim that might have just happened. When the motorist approached the scene, a uniformed traffic cop who was sitting inside the vehicle allegedly shot himself dead. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the 45-year-old traffic cop, working for Bela-Bela Municipality, was reportedly on duty along the R101 road when he apparently left the place. “He was found dead with a bullet wound by the police in a motor vehicle and his alleged partner was also found lying dead on the ground next to the said vehicle. “When the police arrived on the scene, the body of the woman was found on the ground next to the road and that of the cop in the vehicle. He allegedly used his service pistol for the alleged murder and suicide,” Mojapelo said. The outgoing Limpopo police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba, has strongly condemned the killing and urged people to seek professional assistance when faced with domestic or relationship challenges. “The police are investigating a case of murder and an inquest has been opened. I must stress that people should desist from resorting to violence at all times which often leads to loss of lives,” Ledwaba said.
