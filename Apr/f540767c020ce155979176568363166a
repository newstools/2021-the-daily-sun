They say winter is the silly season because everything majestically comes together because of the cold weather. While many sexologists agree that winter is the season when a lot of us engage in sexual intercourse, some might argue that getting naked in cold weather can be a daunting exercise. According to Laura Berman, clinical professor of ob-gyn and psychiatry at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, one of the benefits of having sex in winter is that sex releases endorphins and oxytocin, which create feelings of intimacy and relaxation. It may also produce antibodies that reduce your risk of the cold, research shows. So, here are some sex positions to try this winter: 1. Mid-Winter Missionary Missionary is an easy position to pull off under a blanket. All you have to do is have your partner climb on top of you and pull the covers over him or her to the shoulders. For extra clitoral stimulation, put a few pillows underneath your butt. That way you’ll be able to grind your clitoris against your partner’s pubic bone. 2. Wrapped Lotus Lotus is a very intimate sex position; perfect for those chilly nights when you want to stay warm with your partner. To do lotus, have your partner sit up and climb onto his or her lap, face-to-face. 3. Winter Bear Get in child's pose, butt in the air. Your partner should grab a blanket and wrap it around the two of you. Have your partner wrap his or her body around you while entering from behind, much like a bear. You’ll get deep penetration, plus the warmth of your partner's skin.
