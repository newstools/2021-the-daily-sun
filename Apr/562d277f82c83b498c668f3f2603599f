Two people, including a 10-year-old child, were killed in two separate vehicle accidents in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday morning. A 10-year-old child was killed outside a school in Tongaat, north of Durban, after a taxi knocked her down. IPSS medical rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said that on arrival, paramedics established the taxi driver had fled the scene.   "The other vehicle's occupants, a family of three, are all in a critical condition and were extricated from the wreck by fire and rescue, using the jaws of life. The N2 North bound is severely congested," Herbst said. https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/10-year-old-dies-after-taxi-knocks-her-down-driver-flees-20210423
