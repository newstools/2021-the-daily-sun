LOOKING for some sexual healing this Easter? Whatever you do, don’t do it in the bushes. Especially without a mask or condom. The poking nation has always shocked Mzansi with their awkward videos on social media platforms. And they’ve done it yet again. This time a video of a drunk couple having sex in the bushes is circulating on social media. While the location and date of the incident is unclear, what’s clear is that the couple had no shame. They failed to stop when passers-by told them to stop. During the three minutes and 12-second long video, the man with dreadlocks is seen poking a chubby woman. As he tries to penetrate her, the woman can be heard saying the man’s dick was not inside her punani. “It’s not in skhokho,” she’s heard telling the man. It’s apparent in the video that some of the spectators know the couple. The woman capturing the video dismally fails to stop the duo. “There are kids here. Please stop what you’re doing,” she’s heard saying. But they continue.
