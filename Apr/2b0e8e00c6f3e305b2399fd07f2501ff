On the pitch, Jabu Mahlangu (Pule) was phenomenal.  Skill, finesse and pace. Mahlangu had the potential to become one of the greatest players the country has ever produced. But his wayward behaviour derailed him… in a big way. Whenever he’d be given a lifeline, the Daveyton-born star would spit on it. Even the President of the country, former statesman Thabo Mbeki couldn’t pass an opportunity to knock sense into Mahlangu. Bidding Bafana Bafana players on their way to the 2002 World Cup, President Mbeki made it a point to warn Jabu to “behave himself”, when he was handshaking the players wishing them good luck.   He is a motivational speaker, SuperSport FC brand ambassador and a pundit on SuperSport TV.
