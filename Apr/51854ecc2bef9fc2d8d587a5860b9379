ANGRY residents of Extension 22 in Nelmapius, Tshwane, have been protesting since Saturday, 17 April, and have vowed to continue until their demands are met. They are protesting because their RDPs don’t have electricity. Residents barricaded the road with rubble, stones, logs, burning tyres and even put soil along Solomon Mahlangu Road. Motorists couldn’t use the road, including those going to Heatherly Cemetery in Mamelodi East, Tshwane. Residents said since 2016, they have been promised electricity will be connected, but it hasn’t. Resident Simon Ndou (59) told Daily Sun it hurts to live in beautiful houses with no electricity. He said they didn’t want to connect izinyoka, but they don’t have patience anymore. “We need electricity. We suffer every winter and thugs take advantage of the darkness,” he said. Another resident, Ishmael Mnisi (39) said they have had enough of empty promises. “We’ll protest until our message gets straight to the ears of Tshwane mayor and Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile.” Tshwane’s acting chief of staff, Jordan Griffiths, said it was the responsibility of the provincial housing department to provide power. “Unfortunately, residents are expressing their anger at the city when they should direct it at the provincial government,” he said. He said the city tried to engage the provincial government on their obligation to these residents. Castro Ngobese, spokesman for the Human Settlements MEC, said they were aware of the protest and were in the process of handing over the electrification project to the municipality. “We call on the community to remain calm as the government’s working tirelessly to respond to their grievances,” he said.
