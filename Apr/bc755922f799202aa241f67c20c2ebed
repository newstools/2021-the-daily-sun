MPUMALANGA Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane said mlungu farmers should stop taking people’s lives. She said this while visiting the Coka family in Emabola outside Piet Retief on Monday, 12 April. This after Amos (36) and Zenzele (40) were allegedly shot and killed by farmers on Friday, 9 April. Mtsweni-Tsipane was accompanied by Community Safety MEC Vusi Shongwe and Social Development MEC Lindiwe Ntshalintshali. Amos and Zenzele were among a group of people who were trying to rescue their friend who was allegedly kidnapped and assaulted by the farmers after asking for a job. The four farmers appeared in the Mkhondo Magistrates Court on Monday, 12 April facing charges of murder, assault and defeating the ends of justice.  Their case was remanded to 19 April for a formal bail application. The farm owner has been implicated in a number of incidents of abuse. Last year, he allegedly poisoned cattle belonging to a family that lives on the farm. He also allegedly assaulted two people who died. Mtsweni-Tsipane said the provincial government condemned the killings. “We don’t want our people to feel unsafe in their own environment. “We are saying enough is enough! We are saying we condemn it,” said the premier. Mtsweni-Tsipane said they would help the family give the brothers a decent send-off. The brothers will be laid to rest on Saturday, 17 April at their homestead. Residents told Daily Sun they will deliver a memorandum to government officials on the day of the funeral, as they only take things seriously after people have died.
