THE GladAfrica Championship race has been tightly contested up to this point, with a number of teams keeping their hopes of clinching the big prize alive. As many as six teams will feel they are still in with a realistic chance of finish first and earning automatic promotion to the DStv Premiership. The likes of Richards Bay, Sekhukhune United, JDR Stars, Royal AM, TS Sporting and even Free State Stars are all in the race. But the Natal Rich Boyz, as Richards Bay are affectionately known, have proven to be one of the most consistent and have raised their hand the highest. They remain at the summit of the Championship standings with 38 points from 22 outings, two clear of second-placed Sekhukhune, who have amassed 36 having played one game more. Simo Dladla’s charges have a golden opportunity to extend that lead to five points and buy themselves some breathing room heading into what is sure to be a tough run-in. They face Uthongathi in a KwaZulu-Natal derby to be played at Princess Magogo Stadium tomorrow (3pm), with more at stake than just bragging rights. Their opponents will be fully aware that a win over the log leaders would see them add their name to the teams that are potential challengers for promotion while blowing the race wide open. But Natal Rich Boyz coach, Dladla, will be hoping his side reproduce a similar performance and result to what they delivered in the first round when the two sides met. The Bay outfit walked away 2-1 winners in the reverse fixture, thanks to Khanyisa Mayo’s second half brace.
