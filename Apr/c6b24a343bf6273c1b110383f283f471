Domestic violence is still the biggest issue in our communities. We cannot peacefully solve our issues. We can’t communicate. We let whatever is bothering us overcome us instead of bringing it forward to solve it. Domestic violence is a challenge that needs serious attention. We’re blessed with good brains to think and solve whatever we might be faced with. We should expect the unexpected and always deal with them in a good way. Lesedi FM news anchor, Dimakatso Ratselane, recently became a victim of domestic violence. Defenseless, she was stabbed several times, allegedly by her husband – the same man who promised to always protect her. I always pray that the Almighty Lord plants a seed of peace within us. May God Almighty protect us from evil relationships.
