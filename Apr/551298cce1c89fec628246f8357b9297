RUDOLF Jiyane (31) and his friend Simphiwe Matjhiya (29) have come up with a plan to beat unemployment. Rudolf said they realised there were many illegal dumping sites in the villages because rubbish wasn’t being collected. Rudolf and Simphiwe from Suncity near KwaMhlanga said they charge R30 a month to collect rubbish. They started their business in December and have since employed six young people. “We saw an opportunity to do something better for ourselves, while making sure the villages remain clean,” he said. Rudolf said the rubbish removal plan came up and they organised a trailer and a bakkie. Each homestead pays R30 a month and get five refuse bags for free. Simphiwe said since they started, they collect rubbish from more that 300 homes and more people want their rubbish removed. “Most of the villages we work in are clean and the bad smell is gone.” Before they started the business, he had no idea how he’d earn a living. “But now I buy food for my family and clothes to wear. It’s a worthwhile job, even though some may see it as work for those who did not go to school,” he said. Community leader Simon Sello said what these young people were doing was great. “Rubbish is no longer scattered everywhere.” Rudolf said they planned to expand their business and hire more young people. “We’ll organise another trailer and bakkie.”
