“Hands up! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do will be used against you". When you hear such utterances, one can easily be forgiven if they suddenly have shivers down your spine. More often than not, these words are uttered by a cop making an arrest. However, if this was said in a Fifty Shades of Grey movie, one may also be forgiven to think it was part of a sexy scene, where the one lover has been a bad boy or girl.If that thought really turns you on, then you might just be a Hybristophillia.A Hybristophilia is one with a sexual interest in and attraction to those who commit crimes, a paraphilia in which sexual arousal, facilitation, and attainment of orgasm are responsive to and contingent upon being with a partner known to have committed a crime.This condition is triggered by a sexual arousal linked to a partner who acts out against society via outrage and crime. It is one scientific reason why women might be drawn to serial killers and in some cases have romantic relationships with them.According to criminologist Dr Melissa Hamilton, these are some of the reasons why more women are Hybristophilia:1.Attraction to deviance, which can trigger in the brain the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which itself increases arousal.2.Feeling she can change him.3.Fame4.Fascination with wanting to understand darkness.5.Mental instability
