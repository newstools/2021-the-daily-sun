THE multimillion-rand Eskom corruption and fraud case against Hudson Kgomoeswana has been postponed to 4 August for trial. Kgomoeswana briefly appeared in Pretoria Magistrates Court on Thursday, 15 April, facing charges of tax evasion valued at R5 million. The charges were discovered during the investigation into the Eskom R745 million Kusile Power Station corruption case. The Limpopo businessman and his company are accused of facilitating bribes in the fraud and corruption matter. He is currently out on R300 000 bail. In the tax matter, he is charged with his company Babinatlou Business Services, for evading income tax and company tax between 2016 and 2018. According to the charge sheet, Kgomoeswana was legally obligated and compelled to submit an annual tax return. But according to the state, he failed to submit his personal income tax return during the tax period and caused SARS employees to accept he was not earning an income that would compel him to submit. Investigative Directorate spokeswoman Sindisiwe Twala said Kgomoeswana was also out on R300 000 bail for fraud charges in the Kusile case. “He is accused of receiving money from Kusile contractors, Tenova Mining & Minerals, Esor Construction, Stefanutti Stocks and Tubular Construction, to the tune of R75 million between 2014 and 2018,” she said.
