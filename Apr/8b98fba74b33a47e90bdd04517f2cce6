Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Romelu Lukaku were handed small fines by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) on Monday for their part in an on-field altercation during an Italian Cup tie in January. AC Milan forward Ibrahimovic taunted Inter Milan striker Lukaku during the local derby quarterfinal by evoking voodooism before the pair went head-to-head, trading insults with a furious Lukaku needing to be restrained by his teammates. "A fine of €4 000 for Ibrahimovic, €3 000 for Lukaku, €2 000 for Milan and €1 250 for Inter," FIGC said in a statement. Sweden forward Ibrahimovic denied any racist motive behind the comment. Both players were booked over the incident and Ibrahimovic was subsequently sent off in the second half of the match, won 2-1 by Inter, after picking up a second yellow card. -SuperSport
