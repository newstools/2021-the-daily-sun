 POLICE in the Eastern Cape made a breakthrough in the case of a couple found dead in a shower at a guesthouse farm near Kareedouw almost a year ago. According to police spokesman Majola Nkohli, on Tuesday, 6 April police arrested the guesthouse owner and charged him with two counts of murder. Kevin Pretorius (47) briefly appeared in the Humansdorp Magistrates Court and was later released on R1 000 bail. Nkohli said Pretoriusâ€™ arrest follows an investigation which started on 26 April 2020 after the couple were found dead in the bathroom at Kliphuis Guesthouse on Zuuranys Farm, about 17 kilometres outside Kareedouw. Mari Hoon (28), Jean Vosloo (25) and a friend, according to Nkohli, were enjoying a long weekend at Zuuranys Farm in Kareedouw. The friend found their lifeless bodies inside a shower on Sunday morning, 26 April 2020. Police opened an inquest to determine the cause of death, as there were no visible injuries. Later on, a toxicology report revealed the couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning. The case was postponed to Monday, 24 May and moved to the Humansdorp Regional Court.
