COPS have finally arrested a man suspected to be responsible for the recent spike robberies on the N4 highway in Tshwane. They said as they patrolled the area, they spotted three suspects looking at the highway for a potential victim. A foot chase followed and they cornered one suspect. They also found the suspect in possession of two unlicensed firearms and ammunition, as well as a cellphone with SIM cards removed. They said the suspect was not able to give a satisfactory reason why he was in possession of a cellphone he couldn’t unlock. He was bust and held at Silverton Police Station. Warrant Officer Isaac Mculu confirmed the arrest. “On Thursday night, police and various security companies chased after three suspects next to the highway near the Simon Vermooten offramp. We managed to catch and arrest one of the suspects.” He said while the other suspects managed to escape, security services discovered another discarded firearm on the scene. Thugs have been targeting motorists on the N4 by using spikes and other sharp objects to puncture tyres and rob those who stop.
