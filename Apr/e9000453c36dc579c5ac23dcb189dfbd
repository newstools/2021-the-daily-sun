MAMELODI Sundowns shock 2-0 Caf Champions League defeat by CR Belouizdad at Loftus brought to an end a remarkable run for the ten times PSL Champions. Prior to the loss, the 2016 Champions League winners had played 28 competitive games without defeat in all competitions, spanning the DStv Premiership, Champions League, and Nedbank Cup. Sundowns went to this match, which was their last Cag Champions League group match, having already qualified for the tournament's quarterfinals. However, having thrashed Belouizdad 5-1 in the first round, which took place at a neutral venue in Tanzania, expectations were higher that the Brazilians would conclude the group matches with another three points. Nevertheless, the first-half goals from Amir Sayoud and Ahmed Gasmi ensured the Great Chabab collect maximum points. Sayoud took the lead on the half-hour mark after pouncing on Ricardo Goss' error to round the Sundowns keeper and slot into an empty net. While Sundowns were trying to recover from that, Gasmi doubled the visitors' lead on the stroke of half-time with a powerful header at the back post from Zine Boulekhoua's cross. Sundowns went into this clash without some of their key players such as Denis Onyango‚ Gaston Sirino, Sphelele Mkhulise,  Mosa Lebusa‚ Rivaldo Coetzee and Themba Zwane who were all rested. Despite the defeat, Sundowns still managed to finish at the top of Group B with 13 points from six matches where they won four, drew once, and lost once. Belouizdad are also through to the quarterfinals as they finished second behind Downs with nine points. Sundowns now shift their focus to the DStv Premiership where they face Chippa United on Monday afternoon and Orlando Pirates in the Nedbank Cup simi-final on Thursday.
