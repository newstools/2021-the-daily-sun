ONLY football players are known to be crazy about super fast cars, but there's a coach who was madly in love with big machines. He used to drive a dark grey Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera LP 570 5.2L, which today sells at about R2 million. It drives at the speed of 500km, Coupe, two doors. This Super car, with an amazing interior, used to be driven by Mamelodi Sundowns' joint coach Steve Komphela. Whether Komphela owned the car or it belonged to a friend, leased or was given lift is an argument for another day. He rocked up with this mean panty dropper machine in the early 2000s at Loftus Versfeld Stadium, most fans forgot about the game and were more interested in the car.
