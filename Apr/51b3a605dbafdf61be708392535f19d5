Orlando Pirates’ comprehensive 3-0 victory over Libyan side Al Ahly Benghazi has catapulted them to the top of their CAF Confederation Cup Group A and to the brink of qualification for the quarterfinals of the competition. It follows the achievements of Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs in reaching the quarterfinals of the CAF Champions League in what is proving a boon year for South African clubs in continental competition, ironically as the national team falters.Pirates have not quite done the job yet with a home game against ES Setif from Algeria to come on April 21 and an away trip to Nigerian side Enyimba a week later that could yet be played on neutral territory due to Covid-19 restrictions in that country.It is likely that a point from those two games will be enough, but certainly a victory would seal the deal."We did not have a lot of scoring opportunities, the opponent did very well," Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer said. "We had to be patient and in the second half we had more counter-attacks. We are happy that our attackers scored."It is not easy to get results in these [CAF] competitions, especially away from home, so congratulations to both teams [Sundowns and Chiefs], and now we have also a chance. Normally we have a good way for the next step."But we also have to focus on the next game, we have a lot of work. We have not always the best performance, but in football the result is important. "We are going for it, for South Africa, we want this for the club and the supporters. It is one of the hardest groups in the tournament and now we can go forward. But we have other games and we need full concentration." -SuperSport
