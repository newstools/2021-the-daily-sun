FIVE people were seriously injured during an ANC branch general meeting that was held in ward 32, Jeppes Reef in Nkomazi, Mpumalanga on Sunday, 11 April. It is alleged that a group of people stormed the meeting carrying dangerous weapons. A source told Daily Sun the people were allegedly bussed by former regional chairperson Ngrai Ngwenya to disrupt the meeting convened to elect branch executive committee members, as well as delegates for the 13th provincial conference to be held in May. The source said several people were stabbed, while others were assaulted. There is also information that there were two deaths, however the police couldn’t confirm that. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said five people were said to have sustained injuries with one vehicle torched, while another was said to have been pelted with stones. However, no case has been opened. He said police management in the province urged organisers of meetings where it’s anticipated that violence may erupt to inform the cops in time, so that proper planning could be done with deployment of relevant officials and units within the police service, who are experts in crowd control and in handling conflicts. He said such an exercise could assist in the prevention of loss of lives and damage to property. Mpumalanga ANC acting secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali said they were aware of the incident and don’t encourage it. “We are going to sit and present a report to the Provincial Working Committee (PWC), and we’ve got policies of the movement. We are allowing the police to do their work. Allow us as the ANC to have a meeting because as the officials we have convened, but the final decision lies with the PWC. Then we will brief the National Executive Committee. But where we are now, we don’t condone this, hence we are sitting tonight,” she said.
