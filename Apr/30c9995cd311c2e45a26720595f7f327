THE best is still to come from Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) goalkeeper Washington Arubi! That was the promise of the Zimbabwean international who was the star of TTM’s stunning Nedbank Cup semifinal win over favourites and cup holders Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld on Sunday. Arubi produced a heroic performance throughout the 120 minutes and topped that by saving the match-winning penalty (from Hlompho Kekana) in TTM’s dramatic 6-5  sudden death shootout win on Sunday. Arubi told SunSport that there are even better performances to come yet to come from him in TTM’s remaining eight DStv Premiership matches and in the Nedbank Cup final. Tshakhuma face Chippa United in Ke Yona final which has a purse of R7 million for the winners and a spot in the Caf Confederation Cup.“I am so happy and I managed to help the team reach the final,” said Arubi. “This has not been an easy season for us. But I am happy things are coming right now for the team. We have a strong team that is united. “My aim now is to improve from this performance in our remaining league games and the final. I have been working hard and I should not rest just because of Sunday's form. I need to continue to work hard and keep my head down." Even Downs coach Manqoba Mngqithi was full of praise of the 35-year-old former SuperSport United goalie for his outstanding display. “It is an honour for me when a coach like Mngqithi is saying good things about me,” said Arubi. “But I don't have to be big headed. His (Mngqithi)'s comments are going to make me work harder at training and in the games. It shows to me that coaches like Mngqithi are following my game.” Arubi will also be hoping this kind of form will also boost his chances to be selected by his country's national team coach Zdravko Logarusic in the squad for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon next year.
