PERSEVERANCE and determination are the words that best describe Daniel Leshaba. The 34-year-old from Langaville in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, has become the talk of the town since starting his clothing label called Goat Twii. Although his products are flying off the shelves, the fashion designer, IT specialist and businessman has not always had it easy. He told Daily Sun he had 15 business failures before hitting the jackpot with his kasi collection. “The one business I consider to have been mostly successful was Blue Motion Technology. “It made a profit of just over R1 million in 2014 and 2015, but in 2017, it went back to square one when I lost a couple of contracts with penalties I had to pay,” he said.

He said it started as an IT company, but he later changed it to a fashion house specialising in sneakers, T-shirts, jeans and other clothing. Daniel said the company manufactured everything itself except for sneakers. “We recently relaunched our new collection with Patrick Seleka, who plays Kat in Skeem Saam, as the brand ambassador,” he said. Daniel said his current success would not have been possible if he had given up when his other businesses failed. “Failure doesn’t mean the end, but it’s just another learning curve,” he said. “We are going to employ salespeople in different parts of South Africa. “They will get a minimum 10% share of items they sell. “We will also increase our manufacturing, employ designers and open shops all over the country.”
