CAPE Town City chairman John Comitis has revealed that they have been offered a permanent deal at Cape Town Stadium and hope one day to host a doubleheader with Rugby's Stormers. Comitis said the club were in negotiations with the stadium over the hosting of all 15 of their home games next season and had been encouraged by the city council's attitude, who run the venue. Previously Comitis had run-ins with the council over Cape Town facilities, notably when his team was forced to play a home game in Durban two seasons ago because there was nothing available in the city. "The club is progressing things to get better and we are at the crossroads now of renegotiating our situation with the Cape Town Stadium," Comitis said. "We are delighted in the way that the Cape Town Stadium has received us. The ideas that have come forward and the kind of deals that they have been able to put together. "The intention is to have us there (Cape Town Stadium) literally for all 15 games, find a way to accommodate us as a priority with Rugby.Â Comitis added: "If there's Rugby on the same weekend we will workout which days we play and which days they play and who knows at some point we might have a double header with Rugby which will be a great bonanza for the fans." Cape Town Stadium, build for the 2010 World Cup, has just taken the Stormers on as a new tenant, and it was expected there would be clashes between the codes over availability.
