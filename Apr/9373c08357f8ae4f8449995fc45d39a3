MOALOSI Lesito (35) was heartbroken when he saw pupils walking barefoot on a winter’s morning. “It was very cold that day when I took my niece to school,” he said. This happened in 2019 when he was dropping her off at Adeline Meje Primary School in Viljoenskroon, Free State, and saw three barefoot children walking to school. “On my way home I kept having flashbacks of what I’d seen,” said Moalosi. So, together with his wife, Moalosi decided to donate 20 pairs of shoes to the school and posted on Facebook, asking friends to donate 80 more pairs. He asked Ascendis Pharma to spread the message via its in-house newsletter. “Early last year we managed to raise 127 pairs.” Last October they donated a second batch of shoes at the same school as well as the neighbouring Renyakalletse Primary School. “This time the number rose to 400 pairs of shoes.” This Easter Moalosi went to Mvumelwano Village in Tsomo, Eastern Cape, and donated 200 pairs after friends asked him to help them. “I was happy to put a smile on the faces of pupils,” said Moalosi. “But I realised the school was in a bad state.” He appealed to those who’re able to help with building material to visit the school and do what they can. He said his Pairs of Hope project would continue helping disadvantaged kids with pairs of shoes. “But I can’t do this alone. I need more partners so that we can help those who’re in need,” he said.
