EASTER Sunday will forever be an unforgettable day at Marakong Village in QwaQwa, Free State. This after horrific deaths of three members of a family and a couple in the early hours of Sunday, 04 March. The deceased are Masabata Lemeku (50), Relebohile Lemeku (24), Tatolo Lemeku (20), Safolo Mofokeng (36) and Modiehi Thwabala (38). Free State police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said police received a report about people who’d been killed and burnt inside a house. “On arrival they found a lifeless body of a woman with a gunshot wound in the stomach lying on the ground. “Inside the burnt mud house a body of a man was found burnt to death. “The two deceased have been identified as Modiehi Thwabala and her husband Safolo Mofokeng. The bodies of Masabata, her daughter and son were found burnt inside a shack.” Speaking to Daily Sun, Masabata’s brother Gelboy Lenyolosa said: “I don’t know where to start. I wish police could strengthen their investigations to track down those heartless perpetrators.” Mbambo said Masabata’s 12-month grandson was hit by the attackers with a knobkerrie on his nose. He’s recovering in hospital. The motive behind the attack is unknown. Safolo’s relative told Daily Sun she survived the attack. “I was sleeping in my shack when two men hit my window. Within a minute I heard a gunshot, and immediately after that I heard Safolo asking ‘why are you killing my wife’. Thereafter, they burned the house and left,” she said. Cases of murder, arson and attempted murder were opened for investigation. Police appealed to the public to assist with information that may lead to the identification and/or arrest of the perpetrators.
