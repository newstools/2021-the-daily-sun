WHEN Mbali Sweleni took her sick baby to hospital, she never thought her hand would be amputated. The 21-year-old from Dryden Farm in Delmas, Mpumalanga, said she took her three-month-old daughter to Bernice Samuel Hospital in Delmas on Tuesday, 6 April. She was admitted and a drip was put in her arm. Mbali was then told to sleep in another room and would only see her baby during breastfeeding. “When I went to breastfeed, I noticed that the drip was out. I asked the nurses about it and they said the baby had removed it. “I was surprised how this was possible because it was tied with bandages. My baby was too weak to even raise her arm,” said Mbali. She said whenever she breastfed, she noticed her arm was swollen. “It changed colour from maroon to pink and black. The hospital transferred her to Witbank General Hospital, saying the hand was badly damaged and had to be cut off. “Her arm was dry like wood. They said it would never function. I want the hospital to pay for negligence. I suspect the nurses realised they put the wrong drip and removed it,” she said. Mbali told Daily Sun that she was heartbroken. Her mum Precious said: “My grandchild was born healthy. She went to hospital because of diarrhoea, but now her arm has been cut off. We want justice. I can’t even imagine the pain she felt.” Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane and Health MEC Sasekani Manzini visited the child in hospital on Sunday, 11 April. Mtsweni-Tsipane said a thorough investigation should be conducted and the staff involved suspended. “We need a preliminary report by next week, and the truth as to what exactly happened,” she said. Manzini said government should take full responsibility.
