IT WAS time for a major chop for a woman who finally parted ways with her record-shattering 730-centimetre fingernails. The Texas woman’s nails remained unclipped for 29 years. Ayanna Williams got her epic back scratchers cut off with an electric rotary tool at the hands of Dr Allison Readinger of Trinity Vista Dermatology in Forth Worth. When she broke the Guinness World Record as the woman with the longest talons in 2018, she needed more than two bottles of polish and 20 hours to decorate them. When she finally decided to have her prized possessions sliced off, the first time she cut them since the early 1990s, they measured an astounding 730 centimetres. Along with the record-holding glory came many challenges for Williams, who struggled with common day-to-day tasks such as washing the dishes and putting sheets on her bed due to the unusual length of her nails. According to the New York Post, she said that she’d received lots of different reactions over the years from people who saw her claws, most of which were positive and supportive.
