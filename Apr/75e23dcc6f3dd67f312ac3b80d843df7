PLEADING for his life, Zulu-speaking Xolani Danisa (38) thought he may have won his freedom from his Sotho-speaking attackers. When the Basotho gang danced to a song Xolani played on his Polo’s radio, Xolani from Rondebult, Ekurhuleni, thought he had escaped their evil intentions. But then they killed him. Xolani’s friend, who was also in the car, managed to escape but Xolani wasn’t that lucky. The attackers took his car and left him on the road, bleeding and close to death. His friend came from his hiding place to call an ambulance, then asked neighbours to help.  That was on Thursday, 8 April. Xolani died two days later. His stripped Polo was found that Thursday in Zonkezizwe near Katlehong with burst airbags. It appears the gang tried to set the car on fire, as match sticks were found near the fuel cap, but they didn’t succeed. Residents of Rondebult are now living in fear of the killer gang. They say several people have been attacked. One person who lost his foot is still in hospital.  “We don’t know if they have been sent to spill blood and sacrifice people. It is really scary,” said one resident. “It’s not safe to walk at night and they even break into houses to attack people.” Xolani’s wife Lerato Danisa (32) said on the day her husband was attacked, he was driving his friend to his place and it was just after 9pm. A murder case was opened at Elsburg Police Station and anyone who has information is asked to contact 08600 10111 or send an SMS to 32111 or via MySAPS App.
