SIX people were left dead and a seventh person was injured in an alleged mob justice incident in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday night, police have said. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga has expressed shock and disappointment at the ruthless killings of six people aged between 21 and 27, with another one seriously injured. Six cases of murder and one of attempted murder have been opened for investigation. No arrests have been made at this stage. The incident happened at Zingqolweni locality in the Ndonga Administrative Area of Lady Frere. Police spokesman Tembinkosi Kinana said according to information, the cops were alerted to the incident by a member of the community about four young men who had been burnt alive in an open veld in the area. Kinana said police responded and as they were busy working and processing the crime scene, “another report came through about two more bodies of young men who were found hanged in the nearby forest” at Maqhashu Administrative Area. “This brought the number of the deceased people to six while one managed to escape from the attack and was subsequently rushed to a nearby hospital to receive medical attention,” said Kinana. He said the motive for the killings was not known at this stage. Ntshinga has ordered a 72-hour activation plan to ensure that all necessary resources are mobilised to facilitate investigations and the possible arrest of the suspects. Kinana said anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects is requested to contact their nearest police station or call CrimeStop on 08600 10111, or use the MySAPS app. He said all the information received will be treated with strict confidentiality.
