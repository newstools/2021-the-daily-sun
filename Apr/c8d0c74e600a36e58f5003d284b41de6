WHAT was supposed to remain a bedroom affair left a Douglasdale cop behind bars. The 55-year-old lieutenant-colonel was arrested on charges of extortion and corruption on Wednesday, 7 April. His co-accused, a 37-year-old constable, had handed himself over to the police when investigations were launched. Their crime happened at a bed and breakfast in Randburg in March 2018 when they allegedly demanded an amount of R60 000 from the complainant to avoid being arrested on allegations of non-compliance with tax regulations and operating an illegal brothel. Just when they thought their crime was safely hidden, investigators pounced on them. The sting operation resulted in the arrest of the lieutenant-colonel, who was positively linked to charges of extortion and corruption. According to Hawks spokeswoman Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu, among the suspects were unknown men who introduced themselves as Sars officials. “The suspects allegedly threatened to close down the business if the complainant didn’t meet their demands,” she said. “They allegedly forced the complainant to open his financial accounts on a laptop and transferred R35 000 into one of the suspects’ account.” Mulamu said the matter was later referred to the Hawks office for further investigation. “Warrant of arrests were issued. The constable handed himself over at the Hawks office last month, appeared in court, and has since been remanded in custody. “The warrant of arrest was executed for the lieutenant- colonel’s apprehension in his Aspen Hills home, south of Joburg. “He’s expected to appear in the Randburg Magistrates Court facing charges of corruption and extortion.”
