KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has identified Khama Billiat’s best position. Billiat, who recently returned from injury, has been used in different positions in Chiefs attack by Hunt this season. He has played all across the front three with Hunt utilizing his skills where he needs him at a particular point. But the former Bidvest Wits mentor believes Billiat’s best position is playing as a striker. He played this position in Amakhosi’s 2-2 draw against Horoya Athletic Club in Conakry on Saturday in the absence of Samir Nurkovic and Leonardo Castro. Billiat scored Chiefs’ second goal to help the Soweto giants qualify for the quarter-finals of the Champions League. “I put Billiat in the middle because I believe he’s a striker,” said Hunt. “I have always seen him play out wide but I believe he’s a striker and not so much a wide player. I prefer him as a striker. “But I haven’t had the opportunity to play him there because we have struggled in the wide positions. “I think his movement is very good.”
