IT was a "sour" way of losing their long standing DStv Premiership record for Mamelodi Sundowns. This is the believe of their co-coach, Manqoba Mngqithi, who their 2-1 loss to Kaizer Chiefs spoilt his 50th birthday celebration at Loftus Stadium on Sunday. Two quick goals from Samir Nurkovic and Dumsani Zuma were enough to wrestle the lead away from Sundowns and subject them to the losing side, this is after Gaston Sirino opened proceedings with a beautiful goal. The win pushed Amakhosi into the top-eight bracket, but it will boost their confidence levels after being a subject of criticism. But Mngqithi thought they deserved the win: "This is not the game that we should have lost. We messed around... what makes me bad is that this is not the game that we could have lost our record on. We should have wrapped the game earlier. "We should have got a second (goal) on counter-attacks. But we slipped and they punished us. We ended up with naive defending, which led to the second goal. This is not the team to take away our undefeated record. To say we’ve lost is a sour pill. "Defeat like this wakes you up, it tells you that you’re not invincible. It pushes you to work very hard. We could have scored many goals, but unfortunately we didn't take our chances. "We stuck to ball possession... and we didn't keep our composure. We were not clinical. I made them aware at half time that they should not lose control of the game. They (Chiefs) were at the right place at the right time. (Itu) Khune kept telling them that 'we're still in the guys guys' and I agree with him.  I don't like losing, I just don't like it. Maybe it will help us come back stronger." Listen to Manqoba Mngqithi after the game:  Our unbeaten start in the #DStvPrem comes to an end at Loftus. Time to regroup and focus on the next one! ??Mamelodi Sundowns (35' Sirino) 1???2??
