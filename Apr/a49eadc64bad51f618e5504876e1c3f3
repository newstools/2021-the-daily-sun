THREE family members who were brutally killed and burnt inside their shack in the Free State last week were buried on Saturday, 10 April. Mum Masabata Lemeku (50), her daughter Relebohile (24) and son Tatolo (20) were killed in a horrific attack at Marakong Village in QwaQwa, the day after Good Friday. Family representative Rathabile Putswa told Daily Sun that the killing of his aunt and her children left the family with unforgettable trauma. “No amount of words can explain their departure. Even though the family is pleased with the quick arrest of the perpetrators, it will never bring back their lives. The unfortunate part of the scenario is that Masabata’s young kids, who survived, saw their mother and siblings in a helpless situation. How are we going to correct that trauma in their minds?” Putswa said that the one-year-old grandson, who was allegedly hit by the attackers with a knobkerrie on his nose, was still in hospital. “This has also dug a wound in our hearts because we can’t visit due to Covid-19 regulations,” Putswa added. Ward councillor Diphapang Sefatsa appealed to the villagers to be vigilant of people who terrorised the community and report them to the police. Free State police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said: “An integrated team of investigators appointed to investigate the family murder in Marakong made great strides as it managed to arrest two more suspects. A 20-year-old foreign national and local farmer were arrested in Harrismith in the early hours of Friday, 9 April.” Mbambo confirmed that the farmer’s vehicle was confiscated. She said this brought the total number of arrests to three. They will appear in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrates Court on Monday, 12 April facing charges of arson, murder and attempted murder.
