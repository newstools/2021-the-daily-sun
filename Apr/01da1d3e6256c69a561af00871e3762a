FORMER Uzalo and Isibaya actor Sibonile Ngubane is officially a taken man. He tied the knot with his long-time sweetheart Ubuhle Nkomo at his home in Mandeni, northern KZN on Sunday, 18 April. Their colourful traditional wedding followed Shembe church wedding protocols, which included traditional drums, Shembe church trumpets and Shembe church traditional dance. Sibonile, who played Khathaza Khanyile on Uzalo, told Daily Sun he met Ubuhle in 1995 while he worked in Joburg. “I was sure I wanted to marry her and raise children with her.

He said he and Ubuhle, who is from Tembisa in Ekurhuleni, were not Shembe members when they met or members of any church. “A few years later we realised we have to be part of a church to make our lives easy,” he said. The couple got engaged in December and had a traditional engagement ceremony called umkhehlo. Sibonile said it was his dream to marry the mum of his four kids. “This is our final step of love and I will love her till death do us part.”
