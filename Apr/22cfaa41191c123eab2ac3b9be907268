THE Phalane family will sleep peacefully in their newly refurbished house. This is all thanks to Given Muhlarhi and his foundation, who handed over the house on Sunday, 11 April. Accompanied by Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, Given met with Sipho Phalane and the rest of his family to share their joy with them. The Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, family has been struggling to fix their house after the roof collapsed in September. Given read their story in Daily Sun and teamed up with other business people to help the family. He said: “When I read the story in the People’s Paper, the first thing that came to mind was how Sipho, who is in crutches, coped with his family in rainy days. “I decided to help the family and made sure they slept in a house with a roof.” Lesufi thanked Given for showing the spirit of Ubuntu. He said: “Most people of Given’s age only think about themselves. But he has followed his name and helped needy people. We appreciate his gesture.” Sipho (79) said he was delighted the house was refurbished. “Thank you to Given and all those who helped us. I hope they will continue to help other needy families,” he said. Bontle (25) said she cried every time it rained as they were forced to live in a puddle of water. “I live with my grandparents, who are both pensioners, my mum, child and siblings,” said Bontle. She said the roof collapsed due to the heavy rain and fixing it was a challenge as her mum was the only one who was employed. “The community tried to help us by contacting our councillor who only sent people to take pictures and assess the damage. We are happy and feel blessed that the Good Samaritans fixed our home.”
