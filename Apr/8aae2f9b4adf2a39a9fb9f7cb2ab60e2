A SHOOT-OUT between the Western Cape flying squad and tsotsis left four people injured. The shoot-out began when cops tried to stop a suspected stolen car in Goodwood, Cape Town, and a high-speed car chase ensued. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said cops followed up on information about a stolen white Chevrolet in Goodwood and, after searching the area, they spotted the vehicle with five occupants. “The driver of the vehicle sped off in an attempt to evade arrest when a high-speed car chase ensued. The suspects shot at the police, who retaliated,” said Rwexana. Four suspects were shot and wounded. They’re in hospital under police guard. Rwexana said the police seized two firearms, ammunition and the car that was reported stolen in Muizenberg. The suspects are expected to appear in the Goodwood Magistrates Court soon.
