THE CRL Rights Commission chairman, Luka Mosoma, told suspended Boulders Shopping Centre manager Jose Maponyane his lack of knowledge of cultural diversity was the reason the unfortunate incident happened. Mosoma was speaking at the commission yesterday, where Maponyane gave his account of what happened during the encounter with Ndebele activist, Thando Mahlangu, last month. Maponyane told the commission he acted the way he did following exclaims from some people in the mall. “His front part was not covered and he was not wearing a vest,” he said.

He was carrying a plastic and knobkerrie and I said to security, ‘can you go to that gentlemen and ask him to cover up?’” He said security guards told him Mhlangu refused to cover up and he attended to the matter as centre manager. He then apologised to Mahlangu and his girlfriend Nqobile Masuku. “I humble myself in front of the commission and panel members. “I’d like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere apology to Mr Mahlangu and Ms Masuku with regards to the humiliation and pain they suffered as a result of the incident. It’s unfortunate the incident was misinterpreted and I had a cordial discussion with Mr Mahlangu before the video was taken, which was taken out of context,” he said. Maponyane said he’s interacted with various ethnic groups and has never questioned or disrespected their cultures. “I respect the choice of all South Africans to dress, associate and assert their identity and cultural belief. I’m willing to actively participate in any programme which undertakes to strengthen diversity,” he said. The commission will give its recommendations on 29 April.
