IT TURNS out that taxi driver Mthandeni Masuku, who helped a woman deliver a baby on Saturday, has already delivered a few before! On Sunday, his fiancee Zandile Ntshangase told Daily Sun at their home in Dukwaneni, KZN, that he did the same for her when she was pregnant with their three sons. “The first time was in 1998. I suddenly went into labour while he was visiting. It was in the middle of the night and there was no means of getting to hospital quickly,” she said. “He tied a doek around my abdomen and carried me to the home of a neighbour. Then Mthandeni and two other women helped me give birth.” She was taken to hospital the following day, where she was told her son was healthy. But then it happened again – twice. “In 2000 and 2003 I gave birth on the way to hospital. It was just me and him, so he helped me throughout the process.” Zandile said they lived far from the hospital and ambulances took forever to arrive. That’s why they drive themselves to hospital and sometimes, they don’t arrive in time. She said when she heard that Mthandeni had helped a woman give birth, it didn’t shock her. “I know the kind of person he is,” she said. Mthandeni had dreams of being a doctor. “I helped injured soccer players. Even when I come across an accident, I always try to help. I think this comes from wanting to be a doctor,” he said. Fellow taxi driver Sibongiseni Luthuli, who has worked with Mthandeni for years, said: “As much as we knew that he had a kind heart, we didn’t think that as a man, he would go this far in giving a helping hand.” His neighbour Alvina Zulu said: “This didn’t shock me. He’s the kind of person who would choose to save a life without thinking twice.”
