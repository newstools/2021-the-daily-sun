PARLIAMENT woke up late to allegations of state capture because ANC members thought it was propaganda by opposition parties. National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise told the Zondo Commission yesterday they now wanted to know everything. “It is regrettable that Parliament woke up when things were really bad. For that we must apologise to South Africans,” she said. The allegations of state capture involving cabinet ministers were only investigated in June 2017 after a report by House chairman of committees, ICT and oversight, Cedric Frolick. This was a year after former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas claimed the Guptas offered him R600 million to do their bidding when they claimed to have appointed him finance minister. Modise was not in the national assembly at the time. “If I was chairwoman of the committee, I would have made it my business to find out,” she said. “If I was an ordinary member, I would have put the question to the minister. If I was the minister, I would have approached the presiding officer for space in the house to clarify the matter.” She said as an ANC member, she did not think there was anything stopping members from taking a tough position. “When I’m watching Parliament, I want the member who is supposed to be representing me to ask about what affects me. I don’t want a member praising the ANC member when I don’t have water,” she said. Asked if Parliament played proper oversight amid the allegations around state capture and corruption, she said she would not be able to respond, as that should have been a discussion between President Cyril Ramaphosa and former house speaker Baleka Mbete. She said the Nkandla court decision helped Parliament to do things differently. “Subsequent to that decision, as the Speaker I was not happy.” She said she thought there was overreach and asked for clarity. “That decision of the court has empowered Parliament to do things properly,” said Modise.
