In the history of South African football, it has never happened that a team win 24-0. Played in a sweltering Kimberley heat back in March 2012, Dutch coach Johan Neeskens led Mamelodi Sundowns to their record breaking Nedbank Cup win against Powerlines FC. Who would forget goals from Hlompho Kekana (seven), Richard Henyekane (five), Nyasha Mushekwi (six), Samuel Julies (two), Elias Pelembe (two) and Lebohang Mokoena (two)? It still remains in the history books.AndÂ At the time, the result wiped out the 16-0 victory by AmaZulu in 1976 and again 1986. "My instructions were to score as many goals as possible," Neeskens said at the time. But the goals in the PSL have since dried up in local game.Not only did Sundowns brag about their goal scoring record, but Powerlines goalkeeper Thabang Louw is the worst in Southern Africa having conceded 24 without his side scoring. The African goal scoring record is a crazy 149-0 defeat of Madagascar outfit AS Adema by Stade Olympique Emyrne.
