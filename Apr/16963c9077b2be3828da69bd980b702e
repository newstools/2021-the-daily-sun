FORMER president Jacob Zuma has until end of today, Wednesday 14 April, to provide proof to the Constitutional Court about what sanction he ought to face if he’s found guilty of contempt. This after Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng requested Zuma to provide the sanctions. Mogoeng directed Zuma to “file an affidavit of no longer than 15 pages” by Wednesday, in which the former president must state what constitutes the appropriate sanction. Should Zuma provide the affidavit, the inquiry which is pushing for him to be imprisoned for two years for contempt might be given an opportunity to reply to it. Zuma has earlier acknowledged that he was prepared to go to jail to defy the Constitutional Court’s judgment in opposition to him and the fee. He has accused it of persecuting him just like the apartheid authorities persecuted the late PAC president Robert Sobukwe. He neither took part in the commission’s application to compel him to provide it with proof associated with his nine years in office, nor did he reply to its subsequent contempt case opposing him.
