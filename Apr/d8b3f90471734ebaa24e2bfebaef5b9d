“ANIMAL oil mixed with muthi can do wonders for people.” These were the words of Digital Bones sangoma, Nzama Maluleke, responding to SunReaders who asked if animal oil and skin work. He said oils work differently. “When we slaughter a goat, we use its oil. Goat oil has luck,” he said. He said chicken oil worked differently. “We trust animal oil because it’s the only thing we were taught about. There is no other oil we know of which works.”  Nzama said some izangoma fool people and order them to kill others so they can use their oil to get rich. “That is not on. Human oil and body parts are not for healing and riches. As izangoma, we only use animal oil,” he said. He said animal skin may also be used to heal certain illnesses. “People should stop being misled in the name of money. If you need money you must work for it.” He said muthi helps to bring luck. “No muthi fetches money for you while you sit and do nothing. When we use animal oil we open doors for you,” he said. “We bring luck so that when you send those applications, they get accepted.”
