Dear MizzB I’M a 19-year-old boy and have too many erections every day. I haven’t had sex yet and my friend says the erections are a sign that I have too many sperms which need to be released. Is masturbation safe? Dear Brother Regular erections are a sign you are fit and in good health. Having erections shows there’s enough blood flow to your penis, which is considered normal. Your body produces and recycles the sperms and semen, so there’s no need to worry about not having sex or masturbating. Masturbation is absolutely healthy and safe but you should only do it because you are comfortable and ready to explore it. There is no hurry for you to have sex. Take your time and read on how to stay safe sexually. Good luck!
