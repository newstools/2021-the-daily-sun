CHIPPA United caretaker coach Siyabulela Gwambi has seen a lot of improvement in his side since stepping in to occupy the hot seat. Gwambi, who replaced Dan “Dance” Malesela at the helm, is expected to quickly turn things around for the struggling Chilli Boys. He believes the Gqeberha-based side are on the right track, as displayed in their narrow 2-1 defeat at the hands of runaway log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns on Monday. They might still be in a precarious position in the log standings, but Gwambi is confident that they can move away with performances similar to the one they produced against Downs. “It was a very impressive performance against one of the best teams in the country and I’m sure we can start building from that,” said an optimistic Gwambi. “The boys should not be discouraged by the result because there is still a long way to go. We need to keep the same performance. I don’t want to say maybe we played the best team too soon and discard other teams. We just have to look forward to the next games and hope for better results. “We go back to work and prepare for the rest of the matches we have. We can’t afford to underestimate anyone.” Chippa, who remain second bottom with 17 points from 22 matches, will take a welcome break from the relegation dogfight as they turn their attention to the Nedbank Cup. They are hoping to reach the final of the Ke Yona Cup for the first time in their history when they face GladAfrica Championship side, Pretoria Callies, in the semi-final at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday. Gwambi insists that they will not head into the clash expecting anything less than a tough battle against an equally hungry opponent that is also looking to make history. “They had the luxury of watching our games because most of our games are televised, but we do not have the same luxury. “But we will try and plan according to our strengths and we have to understand that league games are different from cup games,” added Gwambi.
