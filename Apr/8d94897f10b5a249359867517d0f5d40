WHEN her kids left home to play outside on Friday, 16 April, she never thought she was seeing them for the last time. But their naked bodies were found in a ditch on Saturday, 17 April. Kedibone Mmaleswena said Siphamandla (8) and Nomthandazo (4) were playing with tyres when they left the yard. She became worried when they didn’t return. “I looked but couldn’t find them. I reported this to the police and they helped us look for them. The community also helped,” she said. The 28-year-old mum from Khayelitsha near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun  they searched the ditch three times but didn’t find the siblings. “The tyres they were playing with were in the ditch,” she said. “We went back for the fourth time on Saturday morning and found my kids lying dead in shallow waters.” Kedibone said her son’s private parts had been cut and his mouth and nose were swollen. “My little girl also had a cut above her left eye,” she said. It was the worst pain she’d ever felt. “The pain of seeing my dead kids will haunt me forever. My kids were inseparable,” said Kedibone. Colonel Donald Mdhluli said an inquest docket was opened. The cause of death was still unknown. An investigation is under way.
