FOUR friends claim they were assaulted by bouncers at a party in Diepkloof, Soweto, on Friday, 16 April. Hope Kallisen (20), Phumlani Duma (19), Mxolisi Mahlangu (22) and Donnell Kallisen (21) said they were stripped naked, beaten and almost tasered on their private parts. Hope said they were accused of stealing a phone. “Bouncers took us outside at about 11pm. They said some people had lost phones and we were suspects. “They asked to search us and we cooperated. We then went back inside because they didn’t find anything.” BANTITI STOLE MY HEART! But the bouncers returned minutes later and took them outside again. “They started to beat us on the way out. They called the victims who lost their phones and asked if we took them. They said no, but they still didn’t let us go.” Hope said the bouncers called a guy celebrating his birthday, who also said he had lost his phone. “Again, we were suspects. Mxolisi was beaten with a champagne bottle by both of them.” Phumlani said they were taken to the basement for more torture. UMJOLO WITH A WIDOW BROKE ME! “Mxolisi and Donnell were able to escape. “Hope and I were told to get naked and put under generators. Then they started beating us,” Phumlani said. He said the birthday guy threatened to use a taser on their 4-5s. “But the head of the bouncers saved us before he could do it and told them to let us go. We’d probably be dead by now if it wasn’t for him.” The manager said they couldn’t comment. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: “A case of common assault was opened, but no arrests have been made yet.”
