THERE’S no winter without amangwinya. Every morning, throughout winter, people wake up to buy fat cakes to kickstart their day. But things could be different this year after seeing how some fat cakes are made. A video has surfaced on social media showing how some fat cakes are made and this has left many social media users disgusted, to say the least. It hasn’t been established when or where the video was taken. In the 30-seconds video, a women is seen using her foot to mix the amagwinya dough. She has a large dish and is clearly having fun and laughing while making food which she plans to sell to her customers. On Facebook, Ayakh Jonga commented on the video, saying: “That’s why they taste so nice.” Tebogo Tshivalo said: “Tjo, my love for amagwinya. Mosadi o mara.” Nomby Mpanza said: “She needs to be found. This unacceptable.” Sphesihle Sibeko said: “We’ve been eating all sorts of stuff from an early age and we’ve made it this far. So even food at restaurants...people who prepare them bayajuluka and all and where do those drops go?” Raymond Marurao said: “Support black business.....once saw someone doing then same thing wen mixing Atchaar.”
