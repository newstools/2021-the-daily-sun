MAMELODI Sundowns remain unbeaten in the league.  But it will be of concern to the famous coaching trio that the Brazilians are winless in two matches.  A week ago, Sundowns threatened to flatten anyone who stands in their way.  But six days later, they look as ordinary as Wednesday afternoon, seen as they were held to a goalless draw by AmaZulu in their DStv Premiership clash at Kings Park Stadium on Wednesday.  Gone was the invincible Brazilians, who crushed Orlando Pirates 4-1, before falling to lowly TTM in the Nedbank Cup semi-final at home on Sunday.  In fact, they were fortunate to walk away with a draw after Lehlohonolo Majoro missed a perfect chance to grab the winner for the home side.  For Peter Shalulile, it was truly an afternoon of misfortune, piled on embarrassment with a shocking miss late in the second half, when tapping in looked the simplest thing to do.  The Namibian looked like a man who had forgotten where he had parked his car, going Awol as was the case against TTM.  But he cannot be singled out for blame as Sundowns had a midfield that might just have been introduced to one another on the bus to the game.  There was a period at the start of the game during which Benni McCarthy’s team looked by far the more impressive of the two teams, Augustine Mulenga turning two defenders inside out.  Unfortunately, he was let down by some poor finishing as his shot bounced off the upright.
