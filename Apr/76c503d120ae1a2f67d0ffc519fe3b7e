Controversial media personality Zodwa Wabantu continues to prove she’s one of the most business-savvy entertainers in Mzansi. From dancing with a beer bottle, to launching her petroleum jelly, perfume, beauty line and now egg business, Zodwa has done almost all. The talented media personality, who recently sparked a debate when she dropped a purse full of ARV pills, revealed she’s taking her egg business to ekasi. She revealed she has bought a container to store them. “Bought a container for The Zodwa Wabantu egg business. My eggs will be affordable for every township, no rent stories,” she wrote.

She told Daily Sun that she opened the business to stay afloat. “We don’t know what the future holds for artists, and I don’t want to be broke. That’s my biggest fear. I had to be proactive and think of other ways to make money,” she shared. Zodwa sells live chickens and branded eggs. “My business will be based in Mpumalanga. But for now, while I’m in Joburg, I’ll be selling from the back of my car.” A post shared by zodwalibram (@zodwalibram)
