THE Vedala family in Samora Machel, Cape Town, are still in shock after two of their kids ate chocolate and died. Their father Vumile Vedala (50) said the family ate chocolate and salad on Tuesday afternoon. “I didn’t eat the African salad. I just ate meat and chocolate. Other family members, except my 11-year-old son, also didn’t eat it,” said Vedala. On Wednesday morning, the whole family woke up feeling sick and he ended up not going to work. “We slept all day, and my four-year-old daughter Maria started vomiting and having a runny stomach. “While we were still shocked at what was happening, my one-year-old son Mzwandile started crying and vomiting.” Vumile said the chocolate they’d eaten was brought home by his wife. “My wife brought the chocolate, hence I say it was poisoned. It can’t be the African salad because I didn’t eat it,” he said. They were all taken to hospital and admitted for the night. “We were then discharged on Thursday,” he said. Siblings Maria and Mzwandile died. “I’m still shocked why God allowed my kids to die like this. What have we done to go through such pain?” he said. “Police took the chocolate. But according to doctors my kids died of food poisoning. “I’m not sure who’d want to kill my family. I didn’t eat too much of it because I don’t like sweet things, otherwise we’d all be dead.” Captain FC van Wyk said an inquest docket was opened for investigation. “A post mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death,” he said.
