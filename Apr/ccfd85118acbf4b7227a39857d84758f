It seems as if Nsfas is not covering all tertiary education costs. Students are complaining about not getting book allowances, accommodation fees, transport fees and other things. In past years, we used to see some students going around the streets begging for money to buy food. My friend told me he was approached by two young female students from Nkandla, who wanted money to buy groceries. They were willing to have sex for the whole night if he gave them R500 for groceries. It’s painful for students to move away from home and then face challenges. The education minister must make sure everything is fully paid up before all students leave rural areas to pursue their studies in cities. I heard there was a tavern in Hillbrow where students from rural areas used to go just to get cash from male patrons. Government needs to look into Nsfas and make it better, otherwise the students won’t stop sleeping around for survival. - Letter by Simo Shangase, Denver Hostel, Joburg
