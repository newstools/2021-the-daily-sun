A RAPE victim from Orlando East in Soweto has advised other victims to immediately report abuse. She said one must not listen to family members who try to convince them not to report the incident. The woman told Daily Sun this happened to her after she was repeatedly raped by her grandfather and fell pregnant. She said when she told her family about the rape, her mum and aunt told her they would not involve the cops, but would fix it. “He continued to rape me. At some point, I ran away from home because of this. “I came back and he raped me again. This time I fell pregnant,” she said. She said her mum died when she was four months pregnant and she was left with her aunt, brother and grandfather. “My grandfather didn’t care about my child, he treated me like a stranger. “He didn’t want anything to do with her. He told me I needed to leave his house,” she said. The woman said she had been planning to move out, but didn’t have the means. She recently found a job and has been living in an apartment with her child. “I feel a bit better and will start attending therapy soon,” she said. She said she has distanced herself from her family and wants to move forward with her life. Asked whether she would open a case, the woman said: “I don’t even have the energy to open a case. I have a 12- year-old and I’ve been dealing with this long enough.” Daily Sun spoke to her aunt who knew about rape and she said it wasn’t her place to decide what to do. “I don’t want to be associated with this. She’s not my child, I’m just her aunt,” she said. When pressed with more questions, she hung up.
