DAN Malesela has been fired, according to sources close to the club. Following their 5-1 DStv Premiership hammering by Maritzburg United on Saturday, Chilli Boys chairman, Siviwe Mpengesi, has released Malesela from his post. This is the umpteenth time Malesela is axed by Mpengesi following three other stints in the past. It's also understood that Morgan Mammila is back in the Chippa structures as team manager after having been tasked with an ABC Motsepe club, BCM Stars, which is owned by Mpengesi's son. "Chippa had a private meeting with Malesela and broke news to him that it's best if he leaves. Maybe it was just a heat of the moment reaction but the coach knows," said our deep throat. Chippa are 14th on the log with a mere 17 points from 21 games - four more than 16th placed side Black Leopards. Efforts to get confirmation from the club proved fruitless as no one responded to calls from SunSport. Malesela joined Chippa from TS Galaxy where he was also fired following a string of poor results.
