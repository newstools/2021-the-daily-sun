PASTOR Olajide Jones had a sermon for homeless people at Jubilee Park in Tshwane. He didn’t just minister to them but came bearing food and clothes. They were given pap and meat and clothes were laid down for anyone to choose any item they liked. Jones said giving to and feeding the hungry is part of preaching. “Giving is Christian. Jesus didn’t just preach. He fed the masses,” he said. He said he usually feeds and preaches to the homeless once a month. “I dedicate a day to them and go to an environment where they don’t feel judged,” he said. “I give them hope that even though they’re down, the Lord cares about them and can still come through for them.” Jones said some of the homeless have visited his church in Sunnyside. “Some have gone on to change their lives and testified in church to inspire others. That’s what makes me keep doing this.” Mpho Mofokeng, who manages Spur Steak Ranch in Sunnypark, said they supply the pastor with meat. “We help where there’s a need. We’re always available to lend a hand as Spur,” he said. “We like what the pastor is doing. One can’t just preach to the hungry and only give them hope. Let’s feed them while giving them hope.” Peter Nkosi, who lives on the streets of Tshwane, said he never missed pastor Jones’ sermons. “I don’t have to struggle or beg for food on that day and I also get to choose clothes,” he said. He said the pastor’s teachings offered hope. “You can talk to him if you feel heavy after his preaching. He always has time and knows that the streets are tough,” he said.
