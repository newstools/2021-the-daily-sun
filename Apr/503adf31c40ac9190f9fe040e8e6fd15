NHLAKANIPHO Mbatha enjoys fooling around with married women, but this time he pushed his luck too far! The 38-year-old from Diepkloof, Soweto, told Daily Sun his 4-5 has died and he’s desperate to get it back to life. He said he met a woman four months ago at a mall. He saw the ring on her finger, but he wasn’t bothered. “I’m just not attracted to single women. I believe the love of my life will come from another man’s marriage.” They began dating that same day. “When we started dating she told me she’s not a cheater and she was worried her husband might find out. But I didn’t want to hear about this,” he said. But then towards the end of last month, Nhlakanipho got a nasty phone call from the woman’s husband. “He told me I’ll regret going near his wife. He told me to stay away from her, but I didn’t want to leave her,” he said. ALSO READ: HAWKS
CONFIRM HERITAGE FUND CASE! Then, a week later, he noticed his 4-5 wasn’t working anymore. He didn’t have his usual morning erection. “I went to a urologist who said I had nothing to worry about,” he said.  When the pills didn’t help he went to a sangoma who told him the woman’s husband had locked his 4-5. The sangoma said he couldn’t help him as the muthi the husband had used was too strong.

I hope he’ll move on.”
