HER late father’s company called her in February as she was her parents’ sole heir. But her uncle, who is her father’s brother, was not happy that the 14-year-old would get everything. Last week, the young girl was found brutally murdered near the railway line in Rondebult kasi, Ekurhuleni. Two suspects, including her uncle’s son, were arrested for her murder. On Thursday, 22 April, young people in Rondebult went to the uncle’s house and accused him of hiring people to kill the young girl. But he was saved by police who took him to a place of safety. A neighbour said the young girl’s uncle looked after her after her parents died. But the girl was not happy in her parents’ home and lived with her as she was friends with her daughter. “She lived with me for two months. “She had to sign for her father’s money as a beneficiary, but still didn’t want to live with her uncle even though I tried to convince her,” said the neighbour. She said the uncle told her to come back home. “She lived with her uncle for a few days and came back to my place again,” she said. The girl’s aunt said: “She didn’t seem happy. “It shows the uncle was after the money because he was overheard saying we must give him the death certificate after the burial. “She didn’t deserve to die in the manner she did. All we want is justice for her.” The aunt said bloody clothes were found in the uncle’s room and were taken by the police. “They tried to frame other people, but the police suspected something because of the way they behaved at the crime scene,” said the aunt. The People’s Paper spoke to the uncle who confirmed being attacked by residents, but refused to say why he was attacked. He said it was none of Daily Sun’s business before hanging up the phone. The young girl is yet to be buried. Alberton police spokesman Captain Manare Ramotshela confirmed that two suspects were arrested and have already appeared in court. They will make their second appearance this week.
