ONE step forward and two steps back. That’s been the story of the season so far for Kaizer Chiefs this season. They promise so much, yet deliver so little, especially on the domestic front. They were once again brought back down to earth from the highs of qualifying for the quarter-finals of the Caf Champions League for the first time at the weekend. Amakhosi were held to a 1-1 draw by Baroka FC in their DStv Premiership clash at the Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday. Evidence Makgopa salvaged a point for the Limpopo outfit late in the match, cancelling out Lebogang Manyama’s brilliant opener. Bakgaga’s young talisman was high in confidence after he was named in the preliminary 40-man squad for the Olympic Games by SA Under-23 coach David Notoane earlier in the day. His strike forced Amakhosi into their 10th draw of the season in the league, denting their chances of finishing in the top eight. The Glamour Boys were high in confidence heading into the match on the back of their historic maiden qualification to the Champions League quarter-finals but they could not ride that wave of momentum. Although they are eight matches unbeaten in all competitions, Chiefs have only won one league match during that run. As a result, they remain in ninth spot with 25 points from 21 matches, a solitary point behind TS Galaxy who occupy the final top-eight spot. Chiefs broke the deadlock in the second half through a lovely team goal which was nicely finished off by Manyama in the 58th minute. But just as they thought they had sealed all three points, Makgopa popped up with the equalizer in the 81st minute. Chiefs will now hope for better luck in their next league match against Cape Town City at FNB Stadium next Wednesday (5pm). Bakgaga are next in action on Tuesday (3pm) against Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.
