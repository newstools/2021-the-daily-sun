ACTRESS and singer Simphiwe Ngema has opened up about her difficult pregnancy on Instagram. Simphiwe, also known as Quing Simz, gave birth to her first baby Tiyani with model Tino Chinyani last year. The personality, who kept the pregnancy a secret until after the baby was born, said it was a difficult pregnancy. She posted about her experience on her Instagram stories and said at some point she thought they weren’t going to make it. She wrote: “It’s still so unbelievable that I carried a whole human being. I had the most difficult pregnancy ever! “At some point I didn’t think we were gonna make it. I remember my dad saying ‘they better get that baby out before he kills my baby’. But God had us.” ALSO READ | LERATO MVELASE JOINS THE STATION! The actress posted a picture after she had just given birth, holding her baby. Her mum was standing beside her. She said her mum was still crying even after the baby had arrived. She captioned it: “We cried so much. My mum was still crying in this pic. Mercy said no, I’m not gonna let you go.” Simphiwe, who’s been vocal about the difficulties of losing weight post-pregnancy, said even though losing weight is hard for her, it’s worth it when she looks at her miracle baby. “Yes, losing weight after pregnancy is difficult. But when I look at my miracle baby I’m so grateful and I’m reminded that God exists,” she said. “I’m a good person but my life has been very difficult and I often ask God why and he always says, ‘if it was easy it wouldn’t be worth it’. Everything I have is worth so much more because of how difficult it was to have it.”
