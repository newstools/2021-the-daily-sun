MAMELODI Sundowns might have already booked their spot in the Caf Champions League quarter-finals, but the Chloorkop-based side will not take their foot off the pedal. On Friday afternoon (3pm), Sundowns host Algerian outfit CR Belouizdad at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in their final Caf Champions League Group B match. The 2016 Caf Champions League winners already qualified for the next round of the Champions League with two games to spare. Last weekend, they dropped points for the first time in the group stages when they were held to a 0-0 draw by Al-Hilal. Yesterday, Downs co-coach Rhulani Mokwena said the match against Belouizdad is important. Mokwena stated: “There are no dead rubbers for Mamelodi Sundowns. We are serious people. We try to set the tone as the technical team. From a psychological point, we want to make sure we get into the knockout stages in a winning momentum. “We want to be in the Champions League knockout phases on the back of a victory so we can have the belief that we can win in Africa. In the knockout rounds there are no second chances.” This season Sundowns have played 28 matches in a row without a defeat. Mokwena said they were looking to keep the momentum and win the Champions League title for the second time. He said: “We are not in the business of unbeaten runs, but the reality is, it is a good thing. “The results give us confidence. We have that responsibility to go for every match, regardless of what competition it is. We have the responsibility to look to win it and The Champions League is not different.” South Africa is on the verge of having two teams in the Champion League knockout stages as Kaizer Chiefs need just a point to make history and join Sundowns in the quarterfinals. Mokwena said it would be a huge blessing if Amakhosi progress to the next round of the tournament.
