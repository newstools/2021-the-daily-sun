PEOPLE are now complaining about our scientists not producing their own vaccine. They say our medical team, led by Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize, is weak. What do we expect when our politicians go overseas for medical treatment? We canâ€™t mix the vaccine but we can mix nyaope and other drugs. Look how our kids are roaming the streets, smoking drugs. We need scientists to help us.
