ITâ€™S going from bad to worse for Kaizer Chiefs in the DStv Premiership. This after they suffered yet another setback, a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Cape Town City at FNB Stadium yesterday. Tashreeq Morris and Surprise Ralani were on the scoresheet as the Citizens exerted some sweet revenge on Amakhosi, whose goal was scored by Kearyn Baccus. Chiefs walked away 2-1 winners in the reverse fixture in Cape Town back in January with goals from youngsters Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Happy Mashiane. Amakhosi have had the edge over the Citizens in recent matches but the Mother City outfit were determined to change that. And they headed into the clash high in confidence having an eight-match winless run with a comfortable 3-0 win over SuperSport United last time out. The Glamour Boys, on the other hand, were hoping for an improved showing from their 1-1 draw against Baroka in their previous match. But they could not produce as they suffered their seventh loss of the season, leaving them with a lot of work to do if they are to finish in the top five as coach Gavin Hunt hopes. At the rate Amakhosi are going, even a top-eight finish will be a stretch. Their five-match unbeaten run in the league went out the window along with any realistic hopes of a top-five finish, one would think. The Citizens were dominant in the early stages and deservedly took the lead in the 21st minute through Morris who atoned for an earlier miss. They doubled their lead early in the second half through a deflected shot by Ralani who was allowed plenty of room to shoot. Hunt rung the changes and substitute Baccus pulled one back for the Soweto giants but the Citizens held on. Chiefs now have a tough task of looking for a response against Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld on Sunday (3pm) while City face Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) on Saturday (5pm) at Cape Town Stadium.
