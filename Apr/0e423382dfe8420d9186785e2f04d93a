BAROKA FC defender Bonginkosi Makume has vowed that they won’t show rejuvenated Kaizer Chiefs respect on Thursday (3pm) to increase their chances of finishing the season within the top eight. The teams will battle it out in a DStv Premiership match at Peter Mokaba Stadium, in Polokwane. The tough as teak defender revealed that they know what to expect from the Soweto giants who are highly motivated after they secured a place in the quarterfinals of Caf Champions League following a 2-2 draw with Guinean side Horoya Athletic Club away at the weekend. This will be an interesting game considering that only a point separate both teams. Amakhosi occupy ninth spot on 24 points from 20 matches, while Bakgaga are sitting in 12th position on 23 points from 21 games. Said Makume: “We know that Chiefs are a big team, and we know what to expect on the day. We need to be careful not to give them too much respect. It will be a tough for us considering we are the so-called small teams.” The 25-year-old defender revealed that approaching the match as a unit will be vital for youngsters who might crack under pressure. “Chiefs are a good team, there is no doubt about it. When they pull a string of passes together, they can easily break any team’s defence. Team effort is the only way that can push us to do our best and help youngsters to be strong. It’s normal for other players to be nervous before the match, but that disappears once they start playing.” Makume says they will use home ground to their advantage to punish Gavin Hunt’s coached side. “Football is a whole different ball game with or without fans. Our fans will still watch the team on TV, therefore we need to do our best not to disappoint them.”
