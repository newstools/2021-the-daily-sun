PARKTOWN Boys High is in the news again. This time for a bullying performance that trended on the internet on Thursday, 8 April. Following a video depicting a group of grade 12 pupils having a violent altercation, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has condemned what he termed “ill-behaviour”. The incident is alleged to have occurred in the afternoon at the school’s tuck shop. The disturbing video shows one pupil violently attacking another before being stopped by a group of other pupils. After the video went viral, the pupils involved in the altercation were suspended. In a statement, Lesufi denounced the ill-discipline shown by the pupils and urged all pupils not to behave in a manner that will jeopardise their future. “We do not tolerate any sort of violent behaviour in our schools. Pupils must focus on their studies and if a matter arises which bothers them, they must consult with their educators or principals about it instead of taking matters into their own hands,” said Lesufi.
