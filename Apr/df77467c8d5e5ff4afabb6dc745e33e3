THE man linked to the murder of Sphamandla Khoza appeared in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court yesterday. Thando Mgenge (25) from Ntuzuma F, north of Durban, faces a murder charge for allegedly killing the 34-year-old over his sexuality. Khoza’s body was found in a ditch near his home. His throat was slit and he was stabbed multiple times. Mgenge turned himself in. Members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of South Africa (Glasa) and the LGBTQI community were also in court. Mgenge’s lawyer, Andile Thusi, brought the suspect’s aunt to court for her to confirm that she would take him in if he were granted bail. He said his client was not a flight risk and had no previous conviction or pending cases. “My client is a law-abiding citizen. He is employed as a cleaner at a local school. If he makes bail, he will not interfere with witnesses because he doesn’t know them.” However, state prosecutor Lisa Abraham opposed bail. She said the suspect knew the witnesses and it was not guaranteed he would not commit the same crime again. “Residents and the LGBTQI community are not happy with the way Khoza was killed. The state has a strong case against the suspect. He should not get bail.” Outside court, Glasa secretary Frank Gazu said they also didn’t want the suspect to get bail. LGBTQI community member Hlengiwe Buthelezi said the suspect didn’t show any remorse. “His lawyer said he has children who loves him and he needs to support them. Khoza also had a family that loved him. We also loved him. We are in pain,” she said. The case was postponed to 28 April for a bail decision.
