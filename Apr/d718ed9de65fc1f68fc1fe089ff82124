PITSO Mosimane says he is greatly honoured with the Best Manager in Egypt award bestowed upon him by critics at the weekend. The Al Ahly coach, who once again reiterated his call for local coaches to consider taking up positions even outside of Mzansi, won the admiration of critics, who recognised him at the annual Sports Critics Association ceremony. He has refused to be drawn on reports linking him with a return to Bafana Bafana. But Mosimane has expressed gratitude to those who voted for him, acknowledging the incredible work he has done since he joined the Caf ‘Club of the Century’ last October. “I’m very grateful to have been awarded the Best Manager award, and I thank everyone who voted for me,” said Mosimane, who has been honoured alongside his star midfielder Mohamed Magdy Afsha. “I accept it on behalf of the players, the coaching staff, the board of directors and the fans. I feel here as if I’m at home in Egypt. I feel welcomed and warm, and I have a great responsibility with a big team.” Mosimane guided Al Ahly to a historic treble, winning the Egypt Cup, the league, the CAF Champions League before going on to secure a third-place finish at the 2021 Fifa Club World Cup. He has encouraged local coaches to take up opportunities in the professional ranks, pointing to Kaitano Tembo, who has enjoyed a relatively successful coaching career so far with SuperSport United. He has been touted to take charge of Bafana Bafana, who are without a coach following the sacking of Molefi Ntseki. He would neither Mosimane comment on the possibility of rejoining the national team nor on the prospect of facing his former side, Mamelodi Sundowns, in the Champions League quarterfinals. He has focused on the job at hand and the upcoming Champions League quarterfinals. The Red Devils host Al Nasr in the domestic cup at Al-Salam Stadium tomorrow (Wednesday), and the derby at the weekend. “We have a match on Wednesday, and after that, I will talk about the derby,” he said.
