Dear MizzB I’m a 32-year-old single gay guy who’s  attracted to the younger brother of one of his friends. I’m afraid to approach him. How do I start a relationship without ruining my friendship? Dear Brother Attraction can be short- or long-term. At times it’s not worth it to destroy a friendship over something that won’t even last. Hint to your friend about this and find out what his reaction will be, then take it from there. All the best!
