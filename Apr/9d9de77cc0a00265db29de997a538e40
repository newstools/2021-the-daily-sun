DEREK Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes last May, was convicted of second-degree murder in his politically explosive trial. Chauvin was charged in the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man accused of passing a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. Under Minnesota law he faces as many as four decades in prison, although he may get much less time under state sentencing guidelines. The jury got the case on April 19 following three weeks of emotional and sometimes graphic testimony from medical experts, family members and anguished bystanders. In rendering its verdict on Tuesday, it also convicted Chauvin (45) of the lesser charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter. Chauvin stood to hear the verdict read out. After the judge ordered his bail revoked and that he be taken into custody, he placed his hands behind his back, waiting to be cuffed. He will face sentencing in eight weeks.

The state argued that Chauvin was a bad cop who had violated the department’s stated mission to serve with courage and compassion. The defense said cardiovascular problems and drug use had played a significant role in Floyd’s death and that Chauvin used reasonable force to detain an actively resisting suspect.
