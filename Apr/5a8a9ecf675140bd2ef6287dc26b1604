THE Real Housewives of Durban are officially coming to our small screens. Season 1 will kick off on Mzansi Magic, starting Sunday, 2 May, taking over the slot for gospel show VIP Invite at 7pm. That show, hosted by gospel singer Hle Ntombela, will move to 1.30pm and will repeat at 9.30pm on the same day. Hle’s interviews of gospel powerhouses such as Ntokozo Mbambo, Lebo Sekgobela, Kholeka and Takie Ndou has been doing great and trended on Twitter every Sunday. The Housewives will take over until July, when Our Perfect Wedding returns. Mzansi’s favourite wedding show is taking a production break until then. ALSO READ | NDEBELE RAGE OVER IKWEKWEZI MOVE!

Announcing the news, Mzansi Magic said: “The Real Housewives of Durban is set to keep viewers glued to their screens as the beautiful ladies will open their doors to share their daily lives of conspicuous consumption and splendour.” The housewives have filmed a reunion for season 1, hosted by TV and radio presenter Phat Joe, set to air on Showmax on Friday, 30 April.
