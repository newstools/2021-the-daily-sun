THE family of Regina Mathiso (30) wants to ensure that her boyfriend stays in jail for good. This after she was allegedly brutally beaten by her lover. Regina had broken ribs, couldn’t speak and a doctor said she had brain damage. Her sister Betty Malotwana (39) from Randfontein in Gauteng, told Daily Sun that after the assault, the boyfriend’s mother called them to fetch Regina. Malotwana said when they arrived, they found her unconscious, with bruises all over her body. “Her arm was twisted. There was blood everywhere,” she said. The boyfriend told them she had jumped the fence and he got angry. ALSO READ: HAWKS
CONFIRM HERITAGE FUND CASE! “Another one of his girlfriends was there, so something was going on,” Malotwana said. She told the People’s Paper that two years ago, the boyfriend’s mum allegedly threw a brick at Regina, but no case was opened. “We didn’t think such brutality would ever happen again,” said Malotwana. She said they were glad the cops had finally responded. “This incident took place on 5 April, but he was only arrested on Wednesday,” she said. Randfontein police spokeswoman Sergeant Carmen Hendricks said violence against women was a serious problem. She said women across the globe fell victim to physical, emotional and sexual assault every day. “We’re asking the public to come forward and report gender-based violence. “Let us rather speak out than to bury our loved ones,” Hendricks said. She said that the charge changed from assault GBH to attempted murder. The boyfriend appeared in the Randfontein Magistrates Court yesterday and applied for bail. He’s still in police custody.
