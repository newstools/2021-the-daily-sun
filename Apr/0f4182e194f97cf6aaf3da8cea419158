AFTER her debut as Mirembe on the sequel Coming 2 America, actress Nomzamo Mbatha has been flagged as the next star to take Hollywood by storm. This was according to the Hollywood Reporter – one of the USA’s most prominent publications. This came after Nomzamo was featured in the latest issue of MEFeater magazine. Speaking about her character on the movie, she told the publication why she loved playing it. “Women are now changing the status quo and controlling the narrative,” she said. She told the magazine that her role mimicked her own story of moving from SA to LA. “It felt like my own coming to America story.” The former Isibaya actress admitted that when she moved to America, she became homesick and was ready to move back home after not securing a job in six months.
