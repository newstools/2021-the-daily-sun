DJ and music producer Kabelo Motha, who’s popularly known as Kabza De Small, recently left the whole of Mzansi in stitches. This after a video of him dancing in a club surfaced. In the video, Kabza can be seen doing a trending dance move where he can be seen caressing a bottle that was held against a male friend’s crotch. This led to mixed reactions. Many social media users loved how carefree and humorous the DJ was while others said real men didn’t do such things, even going as far as questioning his sexuality. Reacting to the backlash, social media user Kabelo Sen said: “Why are men so concerned about what other men do? You all sound really touched in the comments.” ALSO READ | HOW JET WILL EXIT UZALO Khensani Mathebula commented: “Kabza has a sense of humour. Love it.” Netshedzo Rotondo said: “The way you guys are against this move, I’m positive that next weekend there will be a challenge. I don’t trust you all.” Then Rose Davids wrote: “Someone come claim your children. They’re misbehaving again and this time in public.” Media personality Lasizwe also had something to add: “Kabza is doing the Lord’s work! These dance moves must be normalised among men. Angithi nithi ‘no homo’. So there’s nothing wrong, hawu.” Tumelo Phala said: “And just like that, nigga doesn’t care about what we’re saying.” Although some people defended Kabza and said it was just a dance move, some said they’d never dance like that. ???????????????????? pic.twitter.com/5jUJS19kNB
