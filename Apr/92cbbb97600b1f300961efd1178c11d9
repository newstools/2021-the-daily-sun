COOPERATIVE Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has gazetted the extension of the national state of disaster on Covid-19 until 15 May. She said it was gazetted in terms of section 27(5)(c) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act No. 57 of 2002). Dlamini-Zuma said the decision to extend the state of national disaster followed consultations and cabinet approval. She added that the extension took into account the need to continue enlarging the existing legislation and contingency arrangements undertaken by organs of state to mitigate against the impact of the disaster on lives and livelihoods. The minister said all citizens were applauded and encouraged to continue observing non-pharmaceutical interventions against Covid-19. “We must sustain our commitment to remain responsive, agile and compassionate as we work to save lives and protect the livelihoods of all South Africans,” she said. Meanwhile, Defenders of the People (DOP) movement demanded that the R350 Covid-19 relief grant increase to R500. The movement even marched to the Union Buildings last Friday to hand over a memorandum of demand. According to spokesman for Region 3 in Tshwane Ronny Lediga, the movement was pleading with government to increase the grant. He added that DOP gave the presidency seven days to respond. “If the government fails to respond to our grievances, we will mobilise thousands of people to march to the Union Buildings again,” he said.
