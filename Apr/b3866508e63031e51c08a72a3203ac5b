ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has hinted that they could bring a young ‘keeper from the Diski Challenge if Siyabonga Mpontshane does not recover in time for the Soweto derby. The Buccaneers visit Swallows at Dobsonville Stadium in a league match on Saturday at 5pm. With Richard Ofori out due to injury, the goalkeeper crisis at Pirates deepened during the week when Mpontshane picked up an injury during their  Caf Confederations cup clash against Algeriangiants ES Setif. Mpontshane, who got a rare start against Setif, was forced to come out just after 24 minutes into the game and was replaced by Wayne Sandilands. At the moment, Sandilands is the only available ‘keeper for Pirates ahead of their Swallows clash. Coach Zinnbauer told reporters that Mpontshane's injury "does not look too good" but could not confirm whether he would be available for the weekend's match. "With Mpontshi, I don't know 100% what happened, but it doesn't look good," Zinnabuer said. "But we have to see what happened with the young keeper, then we have to improve the young keeper. We have to wait on what's happening with the injuries in the next days." Pirates could promote Elson Sithole, who has been captaining the club's reserve team in the DStv Diski Challenge this term. In two games in the Diski Challenge, Sithole kept one clean sheet when they beat Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs 2-0 in the opening weekend of Diski.
