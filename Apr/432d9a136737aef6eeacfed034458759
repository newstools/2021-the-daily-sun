THE date and venue have been set for the massive march by actors who are extras on TV productions. Thousands of Mzansi actors are calling for TV productions to stop paying them peanuts. They say enough is enough. Speaking on behalf of the actors, Bekezela Dube, who owns Becky Casting Agency, said they have tolerated ill-treatment by productions for a long time. She revealed that on 30 April, they will march to SABC studios in Joburg where they expect to meet TV productions executives, to hear their demands. “We are not taken seriously by productions. Our complaints include salaries, transportation, catering, etc. We say enough is enough,” said Bekezela. In the memorandum that they are expected to hand over on march day, the actors mentioned that they have been patient in the hope that things would change. They claimed that the treatment is too much to handle as sometimes they use toilets and tents as change rooms. “As artists, we have been patient with everything that is happening in the industry, hoping things will change. But we guess we were holding on to a mountain thinking it would move. ALSO READ | 'AKA IS INCONSOLABLE' “We are fighting for equality, appreciation, our rights and fair treatment,” said the actors. They said they understand that jobs are scarce in Mzansi, but they’re tired of being taken advantage of. “We have been patient and using the statement ‘Akfani’ (at least) as a lullaby but enough is enough,” they said. They said they are treated like street kids. “We are not street kids. We didn’t come all the way from our houses just to be belittled and viewed as second hand,” said the actors.
