UNITY, factionalism and political illiteracy were some of the issues raised as the ANC and its alliance partners Cosatu and SACP remembered Chris Hani 28 years after he was assassinated. On Saturday, 10 April, leaders of the alliance and the family of the then SACP secretary general, Hani, descended to the Thomas Nkobi Memorial Park in Boksburg for the annual wreath laying and commemoration ceremony. Hani’s widow, Limpho, thanked those who attended the ceremony.  She wasted no time and went straight into addressing the ANC’s shortcomings. “I want to touch on something sensitive. We have in the ANC, the most brilliant cadres. However, there’s a mistake we all made in 1994 and the ANC leadership must take responsibility. We have failed on one thing, we did not take them to political school.” She continued: “This is the political school that was established in exile and taught people discipline, humility and not to speak out of turn.” SACP secretary general Blade Nzimande lashed the factionalism within the ANC and the mobilisation of the MKMVA against some leaders of the ANC.  “Umkhonto we Sizwe was formed as a joint army of the ANC and the SACP. The memory of the MK is treasured by both the ANC and the SACP. We condemn very strongly the factionalism of the name of Umkhonto we Sizwe. The MK would never mobilise in support of some leaders against other leaders of the ANC or the alliance. Don’t abuse the honour and memory of the MK to purse factionalised battles, and want to project MK as a private army of some leaders of the ANC and the alliance,” said Nzimande. ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa said: “We meet here to remember and honour a great son of our soil, and we are also here as a sign of remembrance to one who was among the most admired and also one of the most beloved.”
