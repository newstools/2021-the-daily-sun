THE owner of the spaza shop came in from the back to find his customers lying on the floor and being threatened by a gun-wielding thug. When the shopkeeper refused to give him money, the thug fired a shot at the owner but missed him, shattering the glass of a fridge instead. It appears the thug was after protection money that the owner doesn’t want to pay. The attack on the shop in Philippi took place on Saturday at about 11 am, days after Police Minister Bheki Cele announced that cops have made progress in dealing with thugs demanding protection money. “Thugs try their luck every day, but we don’t give them anything. Now they want to hurt us,” said the shop owner. A resident told the SunTeam the gunman came and ordered everyone to lie on the floor and demanded money from the shopkeeper. “The man attempted to shoot the shop owner who had opened a back door, but he missed,” said Kwezi Qlesha. The owner said opening a case was a waste of time. He said thugs who robbed him at his previous shop in 2017 were never arrested, despite him opening a case. Western Cape police spokesman Frederick van Wyk however encouraged the owner to open a case. “We remind local communities to report incidents of extortion to the dedicated line 021 466 0011 or their nearest police station,” he said. Last week, Cele said 105 extortion cases have been opened since last January. He said 67 cases are still under investigation and 106 people linked to extortion cases have been bust and charged.
