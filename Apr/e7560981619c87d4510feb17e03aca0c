The NPA deserves applause for all the crimebusting work it has done since its inception. But I’m worried. Why is it that it only targets certain individuals? It would appear that those who occupy positions in big institutions are untouchables. Even though the NPA is doing a great job, it must not falter in its mandate to rid this country of corruption. Why are families without water in villages and townships? Why is there lack of housing and poor service delivery? How long must people suffer while corrupt officials live a life of luxury and line their pockets?   Why must the poor continue to suffer? It’s been more than 25 years since the dawn of democracy, yet we’re still trapped in the shackles of poverty? There’s a lot of money in government coffers which politicians loot and go unpunished. o are the culprits in blocking all this much needed services to be rendered? The Hawks should tackle every illegal practice that prevents the masses from enjoying the fruits of freedom. In so doing, they should update the public on progress made in bringing the corrupt to book – and courts, when the thugs in suits are found guilty, should make an example out of them.
