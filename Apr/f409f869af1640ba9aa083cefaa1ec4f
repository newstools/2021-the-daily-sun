Our country’s future is in limbo because of unpatriotic individuals nominated to serve. Corruption, disregard for the rule of law, cadre deployment, and arrogant leadership are costing Mzansi dearly. This is not the time for South Africans to focus on the past and keep on blaming the old regime. While we can’t forget what happened in the past, we also must move on for the sake of our next generation. Rejecting and despising skilled and productive South Africans as a result of them having been beneficiaries of previous advantages won’t advance this beautiful country of ours. - Letter by P Machai, Vosloorus
