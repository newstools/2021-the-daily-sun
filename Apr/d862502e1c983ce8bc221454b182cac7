Drink responsibly during the Easter weekend and reduce unnecessary movements. Covid-19 is still here. Research has shown Mzansi has an alcohol dependency problem. Every year we witness horrendous Easter fatalities, and it doesn’t get better. Some people think alcohol is everything and even plead with President Cyril Ramaphosa to “leave our booze alone” before he addressed the nation. It would’ve been easy for the country’s president to leave them alone had they been drinking responsibly. People get carried away by the long weekend excitement. It’s our behaviour, after drinking, that messes things up. We know that people are going to party, but drink responsibly.
