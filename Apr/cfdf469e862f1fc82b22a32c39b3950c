WHY are the cops dragging their feet?! This is the question the Ngobeni family from Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga are asking after their son was killed in broad daylight while drinking with friends at a tavern in Thulamahashe. Gogo Jane Ngobeni (73) told the SunTeam that her last-born child and only son, Hislorn Ngobeni (36) died on 4 March shortly after his arrival at the nearby Thulamahashe Clinic. She said she received calls telling her Hislorn was injured and they took her home. “At home there were many people and cars,” she said. “I knew my Hislorn was no more.” He had been stabbed with a broken bottle. His hand was broken. “Hislorn was attacked in front of CCTV cameras but police never accessed the footage,” she said. Gogo Jane said the police opened a murder case 23 days after his death. She said two men who claimed to be Hislorn’s friends were at the funeral and told her they had been sent by police officers to get his girlfriend to assist them with the suspect’s contact details. Later they said police were done with gathering information and would make the arrest soon. “We never heard anything further,” said gogo Jane. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said no one has been arrested. He said they requested the video footage, but it had been deleted. “The witnesses who were reported to have been at the scene are not co-operating with the investigating team. They refuse to provide information about what happened on that day,” said Mdhluli. He said the family has been updated and they were notified accordingly by the investigating officer.
