A REJUVENATED Cape Town City recorded a significant victory over SuperSport United to end their eight-game run without a win in the DStv Premiership. The first-half goal set the platform for The Citizen's first win since 24 January. Fagrie Lakay sent SuperSport United goalkeeper Ronwen Williams in the wrong direction from the penalty spot. The Citizens showed dominance from the early stages, with Thato Mokeke winning all battles in the middle of the park. The two sides went to the break with the home team leading. In the second half, City continued with their dominance. Mpho Makola, who came in as a sub combined with Thabo Nodada and scored his first goal of the season. Tashreeq Morris scored a tap in to make it 3-0 adding more woes for United who have now played six league matches without a win. Nevertheless, it was an otherwise lacklustre performance by Kaitano Tembo's charges, who missed the chance to leapfrog Orlando Pirates and Golden Arrows to go third in the log. It was a well-deserved victory for The Citizens, who move to position seven. It has been an arduous couple of months for SuperSport, who have been dropping from the second spot in the log to position five, where they are at the moment. SuperSport is now changing focus to their next match to host second-placed Golden Arrows on Wednesday at Lucas Moripe Stadium (5 pm). The Citizens visit Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on the same day (5pm).
