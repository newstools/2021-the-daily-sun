THE trial of pastor John Masilela (44) couldn’t continue due to a power outage at court. The matter was postponed to 28 June and 20 to 22 July respectively. Masilela is facing charges of rape, sexual assault and transfer of pornography photos. He pleaded not guilty to all charges but admitted to having sexual encounters with the victims. Through his lawyer, he claimed to have been involved in relationships with the victims. He allegedly committed these crimes at his Good Shepherd Christian Centre in Suncity near KwaMhlanga between 2012 and 2018. “It’s a pity that the case has to be postponed to another date as we are experiencing darkness. Witnesses and the accused are expected back in court on the said dates,” said magistrate Marlene Greyrenstein. On Tuesday, 20 April, the magistrate told the accused that if found guilty he could be sent to jail for 10 years. She said his name could also be listed in the sex offenders register. So far four of the fifteen victims have delivered testimonies. Masilela was arrested in May last year and is out on bail.
