MANY people travelled to different parts of the country over the Easter weekend resulting in heavy traffic on the roads. On the N1 there were reportedly over 50 000 cars passing through the N1 Nyl Plaza as motorists drove in the face of oncoming traffic. The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said the situation was stabilised and motorists were made to drive in their lanes. Meanwhile, on the R81 next to Ga-Makgoba in Limpopo, a driver of a silver VW Polo lost control of the car and crashed into a tree. Itâ€™s reported that the driver of the vehicle died on the scene.
