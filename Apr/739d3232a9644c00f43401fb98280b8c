UK police have arrested fugitive Michael Harry Lomas in connection with the looting at Eskom. The NPA Investigating Directorate is pleased to notify South Africans that Lomas, a United Kingdom citizen and former Eskom contractor, was arrested on 15 April in London and appeared before the Westminister Magistrates Court on Thursday, 22 April. He was granted bail of £100 000 (R1,98 million) and he further submitted additional surety in the sum of £250 000. The appearance means Lomas’ extradition to South Africa has begun in earnest in the United Kingdom. According to the statement released by the Investigating Directorate spokeswoman, Sindisiwe Seboka, the arrest and appearance emanate from months of talks with the UK authorities about the fraud and corruption case where Eskom paid R745 million to Tubular Construction Projects. This exposed the state-owned power utility to R1,4 billion as per the escalation of the contract. Seboka said Lomas was indicted along with four other accused in South Africa who were arrested in December 2019 and are expected back in court on 1 June. “Lomas, who was out of the country, has never co-operated with law enforcement to stand trial. The Investigating Directorate brought an extradition application through the UK central authorities to invoke the European Convention on Extradition 1957, the UN Convention against Corruption 2003 to assist in bringing Lomas back into South Africa to account.” Lomas has been granted bail on conditions that his passport and South African ID be retained by the police, curfew between 00:00 to 06:00 daily, curfew conditions to be electronically monitored, not to enter or go to any international travel hub – ferry port, railway, or airport, to report to a designated police station at stated times and days and not to apply for international travel documents or in possession if any. The matter will return to court on 20 May for case management.
