THE Broadcasting Research Council of South Africa has released its latest TV ratings and Uzalo is on top. The SABC1 show has retained its spot as the country’s most-watched soapie, with more than eight million viewers tuning in for the month of March. Although Generations: The Legacy remains the second most-watched soapie, it has dropped from seven million to about 6,4 million viewers. ALSO READ | 'AKA IS INCONSOLABLE' Although earlier on Skeem Saam had dethroned Uzalo and snatched the number one spot with over nine million viewers tuning in, that was short-lived. The show now has 4,8 million viewers, followed by SABC1 Xhosa news sitting steadily at 3,8 million viewers. The spike in the number could have been influenced by veteran newsreader Noxolo Grootboom, who retired with much fanfare. Meanwhile, SABC2’s flagship soapie Muvhango is the channel’s most-watched with over four million viewers, who tuned in last month. Afrikaans soapie 7de Laan is sitting at just over one million viewers. With the return of GC and some cast members of Uzalo, it remains to be seen whether the show will regain the record-breaking viewership it once enjoyed.
