Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer was a relieved man after his side’s 2-0 victory over relegation-threatened Maritzburg United on Sunday that saw the side move into fourth in the table, two points behind second-placed AmaZulu. A second half brace from Vincent Pule sealed the win for The Buccaneers, who might be some way off a title challenge, but could still secure CAF Champions League football for next season by finishing in the top two. "A very difficult first half. They were very aggressive in the high press. It took a long time for us to come into the game,” Zinnbauer said. “Second half was much better. The decisions, we brought a little bit more freshness. And then I'm happy we have Pule. I saw Pepe [Thabiso Sesane] was the Man of the Match. He made a good game. First game in the starting line-up. "The result was important for us after the Sundowns game [a Nedbank Cup quarterfinal defeat on Thursday]. We know we have a lot of tired players. We are happy about the result and we are looking forward to our next game. "[Thabang] Monare and Ben [Motshwari] have had a lot of games. Ben was a bit tired in the muscles. We needed him as a player. He had two times he could score. We changed a little bit the tactics. Pule was very forward-thinking and the two goals were good. "I'm happy about the clean sheet. Pepe and Tsiki [Ntsikelelo Nyauza] made a good game. [Abel] Mabasa was a long time out. he came back and did well as a fullback and then we changed him to a six and he did well. He can play in both positions. Also {Paseka] Mako was priceless. He runs, he fights, he makes metres. "The team works as a unit and it's important to keep a clean sheet. We have Wayne [Sandilands] with a lot of experience. Yes, the defence was good today." Pirates are next in action on Wednesday when they host Algerian side ES Setif in the CAF Confederation Cup. -SuperSport
