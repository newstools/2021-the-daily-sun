KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has given his reaction regarding the vacant Bafana Bafana coaching job. The former Bidvest Wits mentor is said to be one of the candidates to replace former coach Molefi Ntseki. Ntseki was recently shown the door by the South African Football Association (Safa) after he failed to qualify Bafana for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). Hunt has on numerous occasions been linked with the Bafana job but this has never materialized. The 56-year-old might be enduring a tough first season with Amakhosi but he insists he has no intentions to jump ship at this point. "How many times have we been down this road," laughed Hunt after he was asked whether he was thinking about the vacant Bafana job. "It's nowhere near my thoughts. My mind is on Wydad on Saturday, that's the most important game." Hunt will be looking for revenge when his Amakhosi side host Wydad Athletic Club in their penultimate CAF Champions League group stage encounter at FNB Stadium on Saturday (6pm). The Glamour Boys suffered a heavy 4-0 loss at the hands of the Moroccan outfit in the reverse fixture.
