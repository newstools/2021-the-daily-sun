THE search for the new Bafana Bafana coach is officially underway. This after former coach Molefi Ntseki was given his marching orders following Bafana’s dismal failure to qualify for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Cameroon. The South African Football Association (Safa) National Executive Committee (NEC) will next week meet to decide who will take over the baton from Ntseki. The new man in charge will be expected to steer South Africa to the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar.T here are several names bandied about for the vacancy with the likes of Gavin Hunt, Benni McCarthy, Eric Tinkler, Philippe Troussier, Stuart Baxter, Pitso Mosimane and Carlos Queiroz. Safa CEO Tebogo Motlanthe confirmed that finances will not be an issue in their search for a new coach. “I was not around the last time when the previous coach was hired so I can’t speak about that time but I can confirm that finances will not be an issue,” confirmed Motlanthe. “We need a coach that will take us further than where Ntseki has left off. We need a coach that will take us to the World Cup and improve our fortunes. Bafana should be there among the top three (in the continent). We need a coach that will take us there.”
