FOUR women appeared in the Randburg Magistrates Court yesterday. Tshegofatso Moremane (30), Margaret Koaile (42), Portia Mmola (28) and Gontshe Tlholoe (30) appeared in connection with the murder of Prince Lethukuthula Zulu. They were denied bail as they were seen as a danger to vulnerable men who wanted to enjoy themselves. Three of them have pending cases for similar crimes. Fifth suspect Dakalo Mbedzi (32), who was the driver, was granted R3 000 bail. The four women are allegedly part of a syndicate that drugs unsuspecting men, with the intention of stealing their valuables. Prince Zulu died in November after spending the night with his friend and the four women. UMJOLO WITH A WIDOW BROKE ME! The accused said the Prince had sexual intercourse the night before his body was discovered. Zulu and his friend had met them at an entertainment establishment in Joburg before going to his place. The accused said they bought drugs, which may have led to the princeâ€™s death. In December, Daily Sun reported that the accused, except Mbedzi, told the court that the Prince had been sniffing on drugs and had white stuff on his nose. The four women said they were sex workers. But the state said they used eye drops to drug them, and items belonging to the Prince were found at their places of residence.
