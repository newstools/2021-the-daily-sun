AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has issued a warning to their opponents Black Leopards this weekend. There will be no mercy.Usuthu will be going for the kill against the wounded Leopards in their DStv Premiership clash at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday (3pm). Lidoda Duvha are desperate for points as they look to escape the dreaded danger zone where they occupy the foot of the table. But that will not happen at Usuthu’s expense, insists a fired-up McCarthy who wants his side to continue where they left off before the international break. “We can’t wait to restart and get cracking,” said McCarthy. “It will be a tough encounter; they are in a position where a defeat will be damaging to their hopes of survival but that is not our concern. “We will go there and give everything we have. It’s our Champions League final, we don’t care what the impact will be on the opponent. “We want to win and be successful, we want to grow. Unfortunately for Black Leopards, as much as they need the three points, we are equally desperate.” Usuthu will also be looking to avenge their Nedbank Cup elimination at the hands of Lidoda Duvha. The KwaZulu Natal outfit suffered a 1-0 loss a few weeks ago with a much-changed team. McCarthy believes things will be different this time around. “We hope to avoid the disappointment we had the last time we went to Thohoyandou for the Nedbank Cup and did not get the results,” added McCarthy. “I think it will be different this time around. We have no injury concerns and we are not worried about resting players. We will go there with our full-strength squad and hopefully do something good and positive. “The trip alone is a challenge but hopefully we will deal with that much better this time around. “I think we will be prepared for the match. The conditions will be different from what we are accustomed to. The heat is a factor and the pitch will be bumpy but we have trained on similar pitches so that the players can get a feel of what they will be up against.”
