GOLDEN Arrows held on to position three on the DStv Premiership log table, unable to dethrone kasi boys AmaZulu who remain second. Abafana BesThende were on Sunday held to 1-1 draw by Bloemfontein Celtic at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium where they finished with 10-men after Ntsako Makhubela was sent off. Their neighbours AmaZulu remain second after beating Stellenbosch FC to jump them over on Friday – moving them to 40 points from 22 games. It is the same number of games Arrows and AmaZulu played, but Mato Madlala's side are lagging behind with two points, following Sunday’s draw. It was Celtic who broke the scoring in the 34th minute from Menzi Masuku’s inswinging corner. Arrows equalised through Knox Mutizwa’s after connecting with Sphamandla Sabela’s powerful shot. But Celtic should have won this game. In the referee’s optional time, Victor Letsoalo got into a one-on-one position with Sifiso Mlungwana but failed to get a proper connection to the beat the goalie. This is one fixture in the PSL fixture they had dominated over the years. In 33 meetings, Celtic have won 14, including a 5-0 last season during the first round in Bloemfontein, which was Arrows’ biggest loss in the PSL. Abafana Bes’Thende have won only four times. This was the club’s 600th game in the PSL top flight. But they couldn’t mark this historic game with a win. A goal from Knox Mutizwa secured a draw for us in today’s DSTv Premiership after being a goal down at the break this afternoon at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadiumhttps://t.co/jaJ8HN1ZZZ#DStvPrem #DurbanHasMore #OurStoryContinues pic.twitter.com/CNBa7doszh ??Full time??@Bloem_Celtic ??@goldenarrowsfc11??-1???? 90min+4'min???Sugar Ray Xulu stadium??@SuperSportTV PSL (202)#DStvPrem#sabcsports #Lovesiwelele?????#SiweleleSummerSele ?? pic.twitter.com/usiEoX9Xfo
