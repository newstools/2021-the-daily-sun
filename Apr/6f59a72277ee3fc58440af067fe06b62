REAL Housewives of Durban reality TV star Nonku Williams’ Instagram account has been hacked. In her statement, she said the person responsible for this was Russian. “I’m appalled to learn that the person behind stealing and deleting my Instagram account, nonku_w, all because I refused to give him money in exchange, goes by the name of Olya Genadievna – a Russian it seems. “The level of cruelty that exists in this world is beyond understanding. But all is well. I shall rise again. God is forever good #YouCanBeginAgain #AllIsWell #GodIsGood. My account has been hacked. Please spread the word! It’s a sick world we live in.” In a follow-up post, she said the perpetrator changed the name of the account.
