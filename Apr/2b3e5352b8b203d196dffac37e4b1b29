ANC members
who’re criminally charged have just over a week to step aside. It’s still
not clear whether some ANC heavyweights who’ve appeared before various courts
will step aside. NEC member
Zizi Kodwa appears to be in support of the step-aside guideline. He’s certain
it will help in dealing with corruption. “In the
past we might have been seen as defending corruption. We might have been seen
as defending individuals who were allegedly corrupt,” he told eNCA. “I think in
2017 we decided to take the ANC out of corrupt individuals. We decided to
disassociate ourselves from individuals who’re seen to be corrupt. “This is
why we’ve made certain pronouncements about individuals who’re criminally
charged to step aside.” “We knew
that because the ANC has leaders at different levels of state, many of them
will be implicated. Many of the leaders are now being charged. “Some who
have allegations against them must go through a process to give what’s called
an acceptable explanation. I did
exactly that. I gave an acceptable explanation, which was accepted.” Kodwa also
cleared the confusion on the step-aside rule. “It’s part
of the conference resolutions. The first category is that those who have been
criminally charged must step aside. “These are
people who have charges against them and their matters are before the courts.
The second category is that of people who have allegations against them. “These ones
must go before the integrity commission to give an acceptable explanation. So
the letter to the SG doesn’t create any confusion. “There are
two processes. The first process of 30 days strictly talks to people who’re
criminally charged in court.”
