A video of an attempted hijacking has surfaced on social media. In the video, a car can be seen driving behind a taxi in Khayelitsha, and suddenly a gunman jumps into the middle of the road and points the gun at the driver. Instead of panicking, the driver engages the reverse gear and pulls away from the gunman. Two other men surface, and they try to chase the car on foot, but it was too fast for them. Itâ€™s not clear when the incident occurred.
