A shoot-out between the Western Cape Flying Squad and tsotsis
ensued, and left four people injured. The shoot-out began when cops tried to stop a suspected stolen car
in Goodwood, Cape Town, and a high-speed car chase ensued. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said cops followed up
on information of a stolen white Chevrolet that was driving in Goodwood and
after searching the area they spotted the vehicle with five occupants. “The driver of the vehicle sped off in an attempt to evade arrest
when a high-speed car chase ensued. The suspects shot at the police who
retaliated,” said Rwexana. Four suspects were shot and wounded. They are in hospital under
police guard. Rwexana said the police seized two firearms, ammunition and the
car that was reported stolen in Muizenberg. The suspects are expected to appear in the Goodwood Magistrates
Court soon.
