MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi has ruled himself out of the vacant Bafana Bafana coaching hot seat. But he has thanked all those that have thrown his name into the hat to replace Molefi Ntseki who was fired recently after Bafana failed to qualify for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon next year. The former Golden Arrows coach revealed that he is “committed” to Sundowns, and for now he’s not interested in coaching Bafana. Mngqithi’s focus is on winning the DStv Premiership this season, winning the Caf Champions League and taking the club back to the Fifa Club World Cup, amid rumours that the SA Football Association’s technical committee have set their sights on hiring him to replace Ntseki. Downs under co-coaches Mngqithi, Steve Komphela and Rhulani Mokwena lead the DStv Premiership table with 43 points after 19 games and are the only club who have their unbeaten league record intact. Sundowns are also through to the Caf Champions League quarterfinals after winning Group B with 13 points from six matches. “At the moment, my focus is on Sundowns,” said Mngqithi when asked what his reaction will be should Safa come calling for him to take over the Bafana job. “Unfortunately my focus is on the championship (the league), the Champions League which will see the team (back) in the Club World Cup and the Nedbank Cup. “Those are the things I’m concentrating on right now. It will be very difficult at this stage for that to happen (for me to take over), but I’m not saying it will not happen. But at this stage, I’m very committed to Sundowns.” Apart from Mngqithi, other coaches in the Safa frame are Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy and Kaizer Chiefs’ Gavin Hunt. According to SunSport sources, Mosimane is their number one target, with the association set to have interviews later this week.
