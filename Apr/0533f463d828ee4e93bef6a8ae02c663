IT has always been said that people who tend to use the right side of the brain are more creative. They view the world from a lens perspective, and dream in colour and motion picture. If you understand and live with a creative, you will know that they can often suffer from a mental block, otherwise known as a creative or writer’s block. This often happens because of stress or a lack of “creative spark”, as experts call it. Many creatives admit to having various ways to stimulate their creativity. However, according to sexologists, sex can be one way to enhance one’s creativity. According to Inc.com, during sex, oxytocin is released throughout the body. It relaxes you and makes you feel closer to your partner. It was also recently found that this hormone enables cognitive flexibility pathways, fostering creative thinking and problem-solving. Many experts further explain that sexual energy that provokes creativity can be channelled to the following exercises: 1.	Make art with your lover When you’re all juiced up from fresh loving or the build-up before, create something with your lover either collaboratively or simultaneously. 2.	Orgasmic visualisation When you’re nearing your orgasmic peak or climax, strongly visualise and embody anything you wish to manifest. 3.	Don’t get off When you’re feeling horny, instead of hopping between the sheets, use that fire as a tool to propel you.
