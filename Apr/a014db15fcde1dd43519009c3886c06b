DYLAN Kerr has FINALLY signed a short term working contract with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) until end of the season. "At last the drama is over," confirmed club's Liaison Manager, Rufus Matsena, on Good Friday. Matsena said they had a meeting with Kerr on Friday where they discussed and came to an understanding on a number of issues that delayed the Englishman from signing his allocated contract. Earlier last month Kerr declined to sign his contract that was offered to him three months ago. And the arrogant Kerr dropped a bombshell on the club's chairman, Abram Sello, with an SMS that said: "I quit". But a week later he changed his mind and apologised to the chairman whom seem to have forgiven him, and they smoked a peace pipe on Friday. Matsena said their meeting on Friday was polite and they sang from the same hymn book, which led to the contract being signed. "All the parties are now happy. He will be our coach until end of the current season. We have also included a clause that we will extend his contract at the end of the season, pending the performance of the team," Matsena said. "We will be applying for his work permit on Tuesday at Home Affairs and hopefully it will be treated with the urgency that it deserves. "What will be left thereafter would be a registration with the PSL for him to start working. We're happy that he's now on board." He distanced his club from Belgian, Luc Eymael, whom is reported to claim to have been approached by the club with an employment offer. "Our coach is Dylan Kerr, and that is what we know," sad Matsena.
