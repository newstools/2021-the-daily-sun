THE IEC has acknowledged President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement that local government elections will be held on 27 October. Speaking in Tshwane on Thursday, 22 April, CEO Sy Mamabolo said the IEC met political parties to discuss the elections. He said Co-operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize and deputy home affairs minister Njabulo Nzuza attended. Mamabolo said a number of parties tabled concerns regarding Covid-19 restrictions on gatherings and other regulations that made campaigning difficult. “Some parties have proposed postponing the elections in light of the pandemic. “Others have indicated their view that the elections should proceed under special Covid-19 protocols as part of the new normal,” he said. Mamabolo said they were of the view it was only possible to postpone the elections if laws were changed. “That being said, the commission will deliberate on the issues, concerns and suggestions raised by parties to consider how these may be accommodated.” The IFP welcomed the president’s announcement, despite earlier calls for a postponement. “It’s our hope that with the final date now set up for October, the government will ramp up their efforts in vaccine distribution,” said Mamabolo. DA leader John Steenhuisen said the party was happy. “Nothing is more important to our nation than the freedom to vote, especially when South Africa has spent over a year under one of the harshest and longest lockdowns in the world,” he said. The IEC said preparations such as voter registration could now start.
