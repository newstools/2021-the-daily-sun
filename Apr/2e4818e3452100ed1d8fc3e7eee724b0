ACCORDING to residents, four boys from a section of Ga-Matlala outside Polokwane known as Kgomo School had dragged a young girl into the bushes and raped her. The boys were soon caught, stripped naked and made to walk the street of the village, but that was only the start of their punishment. Holes were dug in the ground and the four were forced to put their 4-5s in the holes as if they were having sex with the ground. They were made to roll around on the ground to the amusement of the residents. Luckily for the boys, a police vehicle arrived on the scene and rescued them. A resident said the victim, whose age was not known, recognised one of the boys and he was caught. “After a few lashes, he led the residents to his friends and the community decided jail was not going to be enough for the boys,” he said. The residents said the four boys had been troubling the village for some time. “They would steal and run away. The residents were waiting for them to be caught red-handed,” he said. “No jail time will ever undo or be punishment enough for what those boys did. “They were lucky the residents didn’t cut off their 4-5s,” he said. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Motlafela Mojapelo said there was no case opened, either for assault or rape. However, he said the police were investigating following the distribution of the videos on social media.
