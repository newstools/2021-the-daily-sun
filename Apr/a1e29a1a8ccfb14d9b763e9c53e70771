CHIPPA United have reversed their controversial decision to appoint Belgian Luc Eymael following public and political pressure. The Gqebera outfit's owner Siviwe “Chippa” Mpengesi, has finally caved under the enormous pressure he's been under ever since he roped in the former Free State Stars coach as a technical adviser. This is the second time Eymael has been released by the club due to public and political pressure.He was meant to take over from former coach at the time Lehlohonolo Seema but the pressure mounted and the decision was later halted with Dan “Dance” Malesela taking the reins. Malesela was shown the door following an embarrassing 5-1 defeat to Maritzburg United on Sunday. “Chippa have decided not to continue with Eymael’s appointment, who will proceed to return to Belgium. It is clear that Eymael himself requires further time to clear his name,” the club confirmed in a statement. “He has reassured the club that he will, in his own capacity take legal action concerning his rights, including the dissemination of the offending media clip through his own lawyers. “We as a club maintain our stance against racism of any form and wish to make it clear that our intended appointment of Eymael would not have happened were the allegations against him have been validated in any form. “We are naturally sensitive to the views of our fans, sponsors, the general public and South Africa as a whole and hence the decision. However, we do regret and condemn the manner in which a narrative was improperly created, without the proper facts being put forward. “The team will now focus on means to pull itself out of the compromised League position it finds itself in and further announcements regarding the coaching staff will follow. “We regret any negative impact that the turn of events may have caused to our loyal fans and sponsors.”
