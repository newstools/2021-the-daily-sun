A MAN killed his girlfriend, kidnapped their baby and ran away. The incident took place on Sunday night in Boksburg North in Ekurhuleni. Boksburg North police spokesman Constable Justice Ramaube said the 29-year-old victim’s throat was slashed with a knife. The boyfriend then left her to die and kidnapped their nine-month-old son. “According to witnesses, the couple had been drinking at a nearby tavern the night before. They kept on quarrelling,” said Ramaube. Ramaube said it was alleged there was a moment where the suspect physically abused the victim and one of the witnesses separated them and took her away. “The suspect became angry and he was heard saying he’d kill her that night,” he said. “Further allegations resurfaced that they both later left to their place of residence.” Ramaube said on arrival, a fight allegedly ensued. Other tenants heard the victim screaming for help then everything went quiet. “The following day the deceased’s siblings came looking for her. They broke open the door,” he said. “They came across a bucket with a white T-shirt covered in blood, and noticed their sister’s feet. Her head was hidden under the mattress. They then called the police.” Preliminary investigations revealed the killer had tempered with the crime scene as had tried to clean up. Cases of murder and kidnapping have been opened at Boksburg North Police Station. “Further investigations also revealed the kidnapped baby was found abandoned in front of the gate where the suspect’s mother lives in Centurion,” he said.
