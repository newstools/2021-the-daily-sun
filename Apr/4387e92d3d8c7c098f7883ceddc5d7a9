A MURDER accused was gunned down execution style. The 28-year-old murder accused, Mlungisi Thabethe, was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting on Gopalall Hurbans Road in Tongaat on Thursday morning, 1 April. Thabethe was travelling from Gandhis Hill towards Hambanathi when the occupants of a white Toyota Corolla Quest opened fire on his silver VW Polo. His car was shot at multiple times before it came to a stop. Reaction Unit South Africa spokesman, Prem Balram, said their members responded to the scene after receiving multiple calls from residents. He said on arrival the driver was found slumped over the passenger seat and had sustained multiple gunshot wounds. Unfortunately, he died at the scene. Thabethe with Andile Nhleko (27), Mncedisi Mzobe (27), Siyanda Msweli (27), Lindani Ndlovu (22) and Malusi Mthembu (22) are on trial for the murder of Andile “Bobo” Mbuthu (16) from Hambanathi. These suspects allegedly kidnapped and beat Bobo to death after they accused him of stealing 27 cases of alcohol from Magagula tavern, which was owned by Thabethe’s family. Bobo went missing on 28 April 2020. His family was informed that he was being beaten at the tavern. But when they went to look for him they were told by the suspects he had escaped. Bobo’s family reported the incident to the Tongaat police and when they didn’t get help, they contacted the provincial detectives who then took over the matter. Six suspects were arrested on 7 May 2020 and charged with kidnapping. Thabethe applied for bail in the Durban High Court where it was granted on 17 September 2020. Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that Thabethe was shot on Thursday.
