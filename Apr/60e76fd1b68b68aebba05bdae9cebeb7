THEY feared nothing, and even stole the railway line at Phomolong in Mamelodi, east of Tshwane. They didn’t care if anyone saw them. But concerned residents called the Community Policing Forum (CPF), which stopped the men. Two of the men disappeared in the nearby bushes, while the other two were caught. Resident, Mercia Makwakwa, said they were still shocked by how brazen the thugs were. “They just drove to the railway line as if they owned it and started cutting the cables in full view of residents.” She said they felt compelled to do something. “The railway line will help us when trains start running again,” she said. CPF member Solly Mahlangu said Phomolong was a no-go area for thieves. “Residents are always alert, especially when it comes to infrastructure that is for their benefit. They work with the CPF and the police.” He said the two men and their getaway car were arrested. “We hope they get heavy sentences so they can be an example to those thinking of committing the same crime,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: “Police are investigating a case of tampering with infrastructure under the Criminal Matters Act of 2015. “The suspects will appear in the Mamelodi Magistrates Court soon.”
