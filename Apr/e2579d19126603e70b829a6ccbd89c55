 ROADRUNNER Ntombesintu Mfunzi is using her pain to help heal other people. Mfunzi is a rape survivor whose heartbreaking story has touched a lot of people across the country. The 39-year-old athlete was raped on her way to a race in Mhlakulo village in Tsolo, Eastern Cape four years ago. The ordeal, which could easily have ended with her dead, completely changed her life and sent her on a mission to help other fellow rape victims. She decided to share her story with the world through a book written by multi-award-winning sports journalist Matshelane ‘Bra Jakes’ Mamabolo. Speaking at the launch of the book titled “Yoyisa (Overcome)", Mfunzi shared how she got over the horrible experience and decided to become a beacon of hope for other rape survivors. “There are a lot of people out there who have gone through the same experience and they need someone who understands exactly what they are going through and I try to be there for them as that person,” said Mfunzi. “I get a lot of personal messages and I try my best to go through all of them because I know that someone’s wellbeing depends on it. I get a lot of people telling me how I saved them because they were about to commit suicide. That inspires me to continue telling my story and helping those that need strength and courage. “I don’t just tell them that they must fight, I tell them exactly what I mean by that. I always tell them that without acceptance, healing is not possible. You need to first accept that this happened to you and it is not reversible. I also tell them that the process is long and hard, there will be days when you feel like giving up.”
