COULD this be Black Leopards’ last season in the top-flight? The Limpopo-based side seem to be drowning deeper and deeper in the relegation zone as they are struggling to move away from the foot of the DStv Premiership table. They failed to secure much needed three points at home in Thohoyandou yesterday when they were held to a goalless draw by Stellenbosch FC. With seven games remaining before the 2020-21 curtain goes down, it looks like the curtain is slowly coming down for the Venda club, where they will kiss goodbye to their lucrative Premiership status. The perennial relegation candidates will have to dig deep to save their sinking ship in the remaining matches. After 23 matches, Leopards are languishing at the bottom of the log with just 14 points gathered from three victories and five draws. They have lost a whopping 15 matches this season. On the other hand, the Stellies were also desperate to revive their top eight hopes. However, that could not happen as they shared the spoils with Leopards to extend their winless run to five matches in a row. Steve Barker’s troops remain in position 12th with 24 points, and are just three points shy of a top-eight spot. This season has been a bumpy ride for Leopards as they found refuge at the foot of the table for the better half of the campaign. Since the 2007-08 season, the Limpopo side have struggled to maintain their top-flight league status. They have been relegated twice and always narrowly escape relegation. Last season they survived the promotion/relegation play-offs.
