ONKE Jalamba is grateful to a sangoma for giving him money. The gospel singer from Cape Town told Daily Sun that artists didn’t get anything when the country went into lockdown. “On Saturday, I had an event and the sangoma came to support me,” said Onke. “On the day of the event, I got R2 000 and on Tuesday I got R4 000.” He said it has been two years since he started working with the sangoma. “I’m grateful. I was not expecting this from the sangoma,” he said. “Everyone knows how difficult it has been for us. Some people lost their homes and cars.” He said the government had forgotten about them, and that business people could learn a thing or two or two from the sangoma. “Business people need to take the initiative and see this as an investment.” Sangoma Sibusiso “Mkhulu” Mathe said he was aware that artists needed all the help they could get. “If we don’t support them, who will? They go out to promote their songs without making any money,” said Mkhulu. He said it was easy for him to assist someone who gave their all in their work. “I can’t sit back while I see them suffering. “I can’t help all of them, but I will assist those who are close to me because I see them every day.” A resident said he never thought gospel artists could accept money from a sangoma. “I’m shocked because gospel artist don’t usually associate with izangoma. Times have changed,” said the resident.
