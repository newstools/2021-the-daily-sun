RESIDENTS are not willing to give up on a piece of land in Rabie Ridge. Although they were told it was privately owned, they will not be stopped from building shacks on it. They told Daily Sun that they would also build houses when they were more financially stable. More than 2 000 people were trying to erect shacks when police tried to stop them. This has resulted in chaos since Thursday, 8 April. Community leader Cosmos Chokwe said Covid-19 hit a lot of people hard, with some losing jobs. “Everyone here is struggling with rent. We don’t work anymore. “Let’s not forget that our government is not of any help. All we want to do is improve our lives,” he said. Cosmos said they knew the land had been unoccupied for 35 years. “So, it’s surprising to suddenly hear that someone owns it.” Another community leader Peter Brooks said those trying to get land applied for RDPs and have been waiting for years. “We don’t care about developments anymore. We just want space to build and improve our lives.” Resident Zweli Mkhize said the land had become a place of criminal activity. “There’s always robberies taking place. Sometimes, body parts are found at that place.” Another resident Idah Dludla said: “We’re struggling and tired of asking government for hand-outs. We won’t give up on this land.” Gauteng Department of Human Settlements spokesman Tahir Sema condemned the land invasion. “The department calls on communities not to engage in illegal activities. We call on security personnel to exercise compassion when dealing with the alleged invaders and avoid loss of life or injuries.” Sema also confirmed that the land was privately owned, and the department had no role to play.
