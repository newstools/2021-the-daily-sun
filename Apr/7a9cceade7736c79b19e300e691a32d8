IT appears Prince Misuzulu will be the next Zulu king, but there also seem to be many contenders for the throne. The late King Zwelithini’s will was read in front of 200 royal house members two weeks ago, but some of the members aren’t happy. In the will, Queen Mantfombi MaDlamini Zulu emerged as regent until the king’s successor is named. Many people speculated she’ll act as regent until her eldest son, Prince Misuzulu, gets married. “KwaKhethomthandayo was the only place where the late king’s remains arrived for rituals before he was interred,” said the source. WATCH: CHESA MPAMA IN CHURCH! Insiders have told Daily Sun princes and princesses from KwaKhethomthandayo royal palace believe the throne belongs to the palace and are ready to challenge Misuzulu. “KwaKhethomthandayo believes the throne belongs to late prince Lethukuthula, the eldest son of the king’s first wife. They suggest the throne must go to his son,” said the source. Another source said the royal house was divided. There are some who believe Prince Simakade, the eldest son of the king, should be king. “King Zwelithini was given the throne because he was the eldest son of Bhekuzulu.” The source claimed Prince Misuzulu has more support because his mother has royal blood. Zulu royal house spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu, said they couldn’t comment because they were still in mourning.
