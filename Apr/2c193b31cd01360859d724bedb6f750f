IT seems like 2021 isn’t a good year for motorists, there’s
another hefty petrol price hike on the cards. The Automobile Association says it expects a further heavy hike in
fuel prices this month with 95 ULP heading into record territory. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy is expected to make
the official adjustment next Wednesday, 7 April. Commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the
Central Energy Fund, the AA said an additional 27 cents to the General Fuel
Levy and Road Accident Fund levies announced by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni
in February would come into effect. And it will add extra costs to every litre of fuel purchased, in
addition to the increased monthly adjustment. According to the latest data, petrol is set for a massive increase
of 73 cents a litre, diesel an increase of 39 cents, and illuminating paraffin
an increase of 37 cents. With the increase to the levies factored in, petrol could rise by
as much as R1 a litre, and diesel by 66 cents a litre. The levies are not added
to the cost of illuminating paraffin. “This means the fuel price for April will be in the region of
R17,32 a litre for ULP 95 inland, comfortably surpassing the previous high of
R17,08 set in late 2018,” said the AA. With the increases to the levies, motorists will, from April, be
paying R5,96 per litre of fuel to the General Fuel Levy and Road Accident Fund
levies or between 35% and 40% to taxes on every litre purchased.
