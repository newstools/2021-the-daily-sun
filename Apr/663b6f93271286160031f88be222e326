FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma, still says he’s ready to take on President Cyril Ramaphosa. Speaking to Sizwe Dlomo on Kaya FM on Wednesday, Duduzane said he’s willing to stand up and raise the bar. Asked what it is that he’s hoping to achieve, he responded by saying: “We have got a country to build, it’s as simple as that. I’m willing to stand up and raise the bar. “If we’ve been able to do it with what we have, and have this voice, then I’m going to use it.” Dlomo asked him if he’s ready to talk about his presidential bid. “It was time for the people of SA to unite and that there’s more that they can do,” replied Duduzane. “When I look at the situation, history makes it difficult to pull people together. “We’ve got a country to build, I’m willing to take a stand and be involved in that process.” In March, a video was circulated on social media with him declaring he’s ready to contest for leadership in the 2024 election. In the video, he said, when 2024 comes they’ll be fully in control. He said that in the next two to three years, things are going to change, affirming his plans to reset, rebuild and redistribute. He said that building South Africa to make it what they want it to be in the next 20 to 50 years starts now. He said his main goals in 2024 will be the redistribution of land and free decolonised education for all students across the country. He said 2024 will be the year of turning things around. “Don’t be distracted by the slide shows and the rhetoric, and the narratives that have been built for a long time that keep us divided,” said Duduzane. “We’re going to pull through and make this happen for ourselves, and we’ll not be dependent on handouts from anyone.”
