Zulu monarch regent Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu has passed away after the short time her husband king Zwelithini passed away last month. This was announced by Zulu monarch traditional prime minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday night 29 April. Buthelezi said it is with the deepest shock and distress that the Royal family announced the unexpected passing of Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, regent of the Zulu nation. “This has taken us by surprise and left us utterly bereft. The Lord alone indeed knows the days that He has allotted to each one of us. “On behalf of the Royal Family, I wish to assure the nation that while we are all rightly grief-stricken, there will be no leadership vacuum in the Zulu Nation,” he said. He said further announcements on Her Majesty’s funeral and the necessary arrangements will be made in due course. Queen Mantfombi is a sister of the current ESwatini king, king Mswati and was the third wife of late king Zwelithini. She was appointed as a Zulu nation regent last month because she is a great wife to late king Zwelithini and she was expected to be a regent till her son Prince Misuzulu Zulu was crowned as Zulu king. She died when the Zulu royal house faced big divisions and squabbles of the leadership after king Zwelithini passed on last month. This month Prince Mbonisi and Princess Thembi were accused of undermining her leadership after they held secret meetings behind her backs. Insiders said she was ill for over two years and she was up and down in hospital but they can’t disclose her disease for now.
