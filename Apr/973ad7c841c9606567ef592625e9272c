All roads are open as people are rushing to spend the
Easter holidays with their families. This is a privilege people didn’t have last year when
the Covid-19 lockdown was introduced. Speaking to Daily Sun, Joburg mayor Geoff Makhubo
emphasised the importance of launching a road safety campaign during this
season. He said a lot of fatalities had been recorded over the
years during the Easter break. “People have died due to road accidents caused by
non-compliant drivers. We always stress that people should not drink and drive
or drive and text,” said Makhubo. He said he was at the launch to offer support to
officers who put their lives at risk on a daily basis to keep the roads safe. Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo launched the Easter road safety campaign on the M2 crown interchange. pic.twitter.com/4p5O9OvxBE  “We urge our officers to continue doing good work. We
also acknowledge the EMS for its dedication and trying by all means to save
lives in the best way possible. We appreciate all of you,” said Makhubo. He said this was going to be a busy weekend although
the country was on lockdown level one with a few restrictions.  “We rely on you and look up to you to check for
compliance, especially the churches, they need to comply. I know a lot of
churchgoers want to be in church during this time but rules are rules and we
can’t afford to have more Covid-19 infections.” He emphasised that it’s not only the responsibility of
officers to enforce the law but that of citizens as well.
