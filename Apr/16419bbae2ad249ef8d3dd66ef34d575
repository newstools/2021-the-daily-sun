MAMELODI Sundowns senior coach Steve Komphela and actor Simo Mogwaza have a striking resemblance. One would be forgiven for mistaking the Downs coach for the Scandal and The Queen actor out in public. The pair share such as resemblance that some might believe they were #SeparatedAtBirth. They have both made a name for themselves in their respective fields. Komphela is one of the prominent coaches in the country while Mogwaza is a seasoned professional in the entertainment industry. Mogwaza is best known for his roles as Mamba in eTV soapie Scandal and Diamond in Mzansi Magicâ€™s The Queen. The KwaZulu-Natal-born actor, however, has been in the industry for a long time and has had numerous roles in both the local and international film and television industry.
