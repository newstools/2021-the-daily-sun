The ambitious mentor believes a point is better than nothing. The club has played 13 draws in 22 matches in their first season in the DStv Premiership. With eight games remaining, they could easily break the record of draws in one season in the top flight. Currently, SuperSport United (2012-13 season), Free State Stars and Santos (2005-06 season) are the teams holding the record of most draws (17) in a season.Truter said the draws are better than not getting result in 13 games. “It is not a record you want as a coach but with these draws we managed to get 13 points. And if you look some of the games where we drew, we were supposed to win the,” he said. “As a newly promoted team we are taking positives. It is our first season in the big league we are still looking for growth. We are growing and learning a lot. ”In the remaining games, Truter said it would be vital to keep players focus amid the rumours of some players leaving at the end of the campaign to ensure they finish within the top eight. Swallows are fifth on the log with 37 points. He said: “We are at the toughest period of the season. Players are reported to have signed pre-contract with other clubs it will be difficult but we need to manage the situation well keep them focused will be very important.” On Saturday Swallows will be out to avoid another draw when they host Orlando Pirates at Dobsonville Stadium at 5pm.
