Have you ever wondered why people participate in extreme sports or activities? Many do these for the adrenaline, which is the thrill and excitement that comes with certain things. BENEFITS OF TAKING THE SEX PILL! The same can be said about having an orgasm during sex. When it comes to women, an orgasm during sex has a lot of benefits. Here are some of them: 1. It helps you make better decisions Dopamine is perhaps the most powerful chemical our brain naturally produces. It is responsible for part of the brain called “the pleasure circuit”, which accounts for the euphoric mood you might feel post-coitus. 2.
