FORMER Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) striker Rhulani Manzini is not going down without a fight. He has reported the termination of hiscontract to the SA Football Players Union (Safpu). The well-travelled 33-year-old player’s contract with Vhadau Vhadamani ended last week after he was found guilty by the club’s disciplinary committee of assaulting his teammate, Alfred Ndengane. The duo was involved in a bloody fight at the club’s training ground three weeks ago which ended with defender Ndengane rushed to the nearest medical centre to be stitched up. The former AmaZulu player said: “I cannot talk about this as the matter is with the Safpu. All I can say is I am not thinking about any move at the moment as this matter is still to be resolved by the Players Union.” Safpu deputy president Tebogo Monyai yesterday told SunSport that Manzini is still contracted to the Venda-based side, as he has not yet signed a termination of contract letter. “To us, Manzini is still contracted to Tshakhuma. We are still negotiating with them (Tshakhuma) about his compensation for the remainder of his contract,” said Munyai. “Yes, Tshakhuma can say they terminated his contract but there are still legal issues to be attended to. We hope we can reach an agreement which will make the player happy. “But let’s wait and see what will transpire in our next meeting with the club. But to be straight, Manzini is still a Tshakhuma player until he signs a termination letter, which he has not done.” Manzini, who has also played for Chippa United, Jomo Cosmos, Sivutsa Stars, Witbank Spurs and Platinum Stars joined TTM this season after impressing then coach Joel Masutha. This season, the Bushbuckridge-born player played 12 league matches and scored two goals for the relegation threatened TTM.
