Eskom’s projected tariff hikes are going to leave us poorer. The power utility wants to use these increases to cover its spiraling debt. It’s unfair on us consumers to have to pay the high price for corruption. These increases are also a threat to job security. Electricity should be affordable for the poor and the elderly. These increases are unacceptable, given the poor state of our economy and rampant corruption. I’m worried that whatever problem we face is passed on to poor ordinary citizens while nothing happens to those who put us in danger. It’s still devastating news for workers and the economy. The constant bailout of Eskom by government is a sign that the power utility is failing itself and Mzansi. The taxpayer shouldn’t have to pay for poor management and corrupt deals happening at the power utility. Hold those responsible for financial mismanagement at Eskom accountable and make sure that money looted is recovered. The embattled power utility’s business model needs to be revisited. It’s clearly not working. Eskom should also employ people who’re qualified and capable, and get rid of the corrupt and incapable lot. The tariff increases are going to make the cost of living unbearable.
