THE body of a teacher was found in a shallow grave in Lenasia South, Joburg. One of the suspects, who is 36 years old, was arrested while the other one is still on the run. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the body of Naadira Vanker (30) was discovered last night at Phumlamqashi near Lenasia South in a shallow grave. Masondo said she was reportedly abducted last Thursday. “The 30-year-old woman was abducted from her home by two men. The suspects are alleged to have then driven off in the victim’s vehicle, which was later found abandoned in Ennerdale,” said Masondo. He said the matter was reported to police and a team of detectives was established, activating a search party in prioritising the case and a search for the victim.  “On the evening of Tuesday, 27 April, investigations led the team to a shack in Phumlamqashi, near Lenasia South, where one suspect was found,” he said. He said the suspect then pointed the police to a shallow grave inside the yard, where the victim was buried.  “The police search and rescue team as well as forensic experts were summoned. They exhumed the body, later identified by the family as that of the abducted victim,” said Masondo. A post mortem will be conducted to determine how she died. Police are searching for the second suspect, who is still at large. The dead woman’s mother, Nayema, asked the public to refrain from posting pictures of the incident, and for privacy. “I don’t know the facts surrounding the case and we’d like privacy while dealing with this,” she said. Naadira Vanker was laid to rest today at Lenesia Avalon cemetry.
