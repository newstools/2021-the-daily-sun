IZANGOMA are tired of being ill-treated by the community. This comes after they went to the CRL Commission to hand over a memorandum of grievances following the murder of Mama Jostina Sangweni (58). Makhosi Maliyavuza told Daily Sun she’s been having sleepless nights since the day she saw the video of Jostina being beaten. “Jostina had a mental illness. She looked scared and confused. She begged them to call her family but because she was wearing ancestral clothes, they decided she came to harm them,” said Maliyavuza. She said the government needs to speed up the process of having a council for izangoma and people needed to be educated about them. “We are not animals and refuse to be treated as such,” she said. Lettie Skhosana, a provincial chairwoman from the traditional healers association in Ekurhuleni, said people need to report any problems they have with izangoma. “When a person breaks the law you report them to the police. I wonder if Jostina’s killers thought they’d get away with this.” Chairman of the commission, Professor David Masongo condemned any acts of cruelty. “There’s no reason for men and women practising traditional healing to be subjected to ridicule.” He said izangoma are called by the ancestors. “You have the right to practice as healers. People like you must be accepted and respected with your gifts and regalia. “We recently had a meeting with the Department of Health to speed up the process of electing a traditional council to regulate all your needs,” said Masongo. According to SAPS spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters, two suspects linked to the murder were arrested on Friday. She said the two suspects aged 27 and 28 appeared at the Protea Magistrates court on Monday. She said the suspects were denied bail and will be back in court on 22 April. Gauteng Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela has welcomed the arrests and urged the investigating team to leave no stone unturned.
