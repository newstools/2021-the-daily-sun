TRADITIONAL gospel group Ivangeli Gospel wants to make Easter great for music fans. The group, made up of 10 people, released its debut album Getsemane on Friday, 26 March. Ivangeli Gospel was founded by Zolani Mkhize and Sipho Mbele two years ago after searching for more singers around the country. Speaking to SunBuzz, Zolani said: “Christians and gospel fans will have some lovely and blessed music to listen to this Easter. “Getsemane has 14 songs and all members have their own. People will love Getsemane because we made it easy for them. They will sing along to a lot of songs.” Zolani said Yinde Lendlela was one of the most important songs on the album.

He will save them. “They shouldn’t give up when things get bad, but have faith in God.” Ivangeli Gospel was started as a means to create employment. “I’ve been a director for the SABC Crown Gospel Music Awards for a while, and I’ve seen a lot of talented people,” he said “I had a chance to watch a lot of auditions from all over the country. I then thought about the fact that the awards were only held once a year and artists ended up struggling during the year. “So we decided to start the group to create work. We’re looking forward to releasing more music.”
