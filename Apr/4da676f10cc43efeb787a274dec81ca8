DOUGLAS Moloi saw an opportunity to make money, so he tried his luck. But the 38-year-old from Sebokeng zone 3, Vaal, never thought he’d lose all his money. According to Douglas, Eagles Empire Forex owed him R260 500, but it was sending him from pillar to post. He said he invested R10 000 in September 2019 and topped it up with R50 000 after he received his first payment of R2 200. He was supposed to receive R14 000 every month for 12 months. He said the company gave him a four-month contract. “The company asked me to top up with another R10 000 so I can receive R15 000 every month, and I did,” he said. “Last February, the company introduced a four-month plan and I invested R15 000. I was supposed to be paid R48 000 in September. It further introduced a six-month plan in June, but that came with conditions of buying perfume for R5 000.” He said the company told him they’d be buying shares by buying the perfume. “I bought the perfume and shares worth R25 000. I was supposed to get R137 500 on 2 February this year. “The company had said they added perfumes as they were not getting cash from investments, but I never got R48 000 or R137 500,” said Douglas. He said a man associated to the company introduced him to Eagles Empire Forex while they were still colleagues at the SAPS. “I invested R10 000 with him and he sent a WhatsApp voice note that he won’t be making payments as he was defrauded. “He sent another one saying his broker was under investigation and his money frozen. He promised to refund me. They owe me R260 500, including interest from the first contract,” he said. The company said: “He still has valid contract with us. That’s all I can say.” Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: “A case of theft was opened, but no suspect was arrested.”
