FLASHING luxury cars and property for clout on social media could be like shooting yourself in the foot, especially if you’re avoiding paying tax. This comes after it emerged that social media can allegedly be used to monitor the lifestyles of those who are living larger than what they actually earn, without having declared their income to Sars. “It has recently been proven that Sars’ teeth have been sharpened to mismatch declared income and the apparent tax liability owed to the fiscus when Sars successfully obtained a preservation order in the Pretoria High Court against the luxury car-loving businessman, Thabiso Hamilton Ndlovu. He’d taken to social media to flaunt his recently acquired vehicles to the value of R10,5 million, which did not sit well with Sars officials,” Jean-Louis Nel, legal manager at Tax Consulting SA, told BusinessTech. On Thursday during a Sars media briefing, commissioner Edward Kieswetter said: “Criminal investigation has also profiled a number of high net worth individuals who enjoy a luxurious lifestyle, demonstrate explained wealth when compared to the income that they disclose to Sars.  “We’re focusing significantly on that area of abuse and we have the ability to access a number of databases that can supply details of high tickets items they’ve bought such as luxury cars, expensive property and we do capital reconciliation back to the income statement.” The commissioner also raised concerning issues around ghost employers and employees. He said: “Under criminal and illicit activities, we’re aware of ghost employers and employees over the years. We’ve seen a steady submission from a number of employers who file returns without payments, or file returns without employees in the hope of getting pay as you earn refund.” Kieswetter said in the past tax year, 335 employers submitted more than 77 000 employee certificates IFP5s amounting to R2,5 billion, which they have detected and are in various stages of investigation.
