The chilling massacre of innocent civilians in Palma, Mozambique, should be condemned by the global community. The world is caught in the vortex of terrorism. If we want to reduce the levels of terrorism, we should deal with its manifestations and underlying causes. Todayâ€™s terrorism transcends political and geographical boundaries. It is sometimes supported by powerful states and a multitude of international actors. Global peace has to become a subject at the United Nations.
