MAMELODI Sundowns have gone 28 matches unbeaten, which confirms that they are the strong candidates to win the inaugural DStv Premiership title – their 11th PSL crown as a club. The Brazilians came from behind to beat Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila 3-1 at the Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday. Thembisani Nevhulamba’s glancing header triggered the alarm bells that the TTM meant business, just 20 minutes into the game. But Sundowns’ resilience saw them getting an equaliser in the dying minutes of the first half through Rivaldo Coetzee. Siphelele Mkhulise, his first goal of the season, extended the lead on the 69th minute before Sibusiso “Vila” Vilakazi hammered the final nail to seal three points for Downs, nine minutes  before the final whistle. With Downs veterans such as Andile Jali injured, Hlompho Kekana, George Maluleke, who were both on the bench, Mkhulise, who lasted 88 minutes in the field, was the unsung hero on the day. The 25-year-old bossed the midfielder for the better half of the match and even got his name on the scoresheet. The scoreline could have been worse as Sundowns were rewarded with a penalty after Themba Zwane was fouled in the box, but Gaston Sirino failed to convert from the spot-kick. Sundowns remain the only unbeaten team this season. They are the only team to reach the 40-points mark with less than 20 games. In 19 league matches, Sundowns have won 12 and drew seven which sets them on 43 points. They are six points ahead of second- and third-placed Golden Arrows and AmaZulu, who are in second and third spots respectively, with 37 points each team. TTM remain second from the bottom with 16 points from 20 matches – three points ahead of fellow Limpopo mates Black Leopards, who languish at the bottom of the table. Without a doubt, with 10 games remaining before the 2020/21 curtain goes down, Dylan Kerr’s side, assisted by Mpho Makola and David Mathebula, are under immense pressure on the  TTM bench as the club face relegation.
