ECONOMIC Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema said the majority of people have nothing, yet they are called upon to celebrate landlessness. Malema was speaking during his party’s Freedom Day rally in Saulsville, Attridgeville, Tshwane. The rally was attended by thousands of the party supporters and it saw Dr Tumi opening the event with prayer and a song. “When they say to you that you must celebrate Freedom Day, they mean you must celebrate not having land,” said Malema. He said people can’t celebrate when they don’t have basic services. “What did we fight for. What was Nelson Mandela arrested for. Why was Winnie Mandela isolated for so many years? We don’t have water, housing and electricity. What should you celebrate for?” he said. He said they didn’t fight to be loved by white people. “We are not on honeymoon with white people. White people owe us an apology and an explanation on why they oppressed us and killed our people,” he said. Malema said blacks are more than 80% of the population in the country but control only 10% of the land. “90% is controlled by white capital. What kind of freedom is this without basic services and free, quality education?” he asked. He said the day was not a day of celebration, but rather a day of survivors. “When needed our government was not there. When people needed food parcels they were not there. They brought soldiers instead of PPE. We’ve got no place to stay. “When you tell the truth, they will say that they will not vote for the EFF because these kids are disrespectful. “Continue voting for lies, leave us with our truth. We will die with our truth because truth is liberation,” he said. Malema blamed the elderly for keeping the ANC in power. “The people who are selling us out today are our grandfathers and our grandmothers. They are the ones who are keeping these people in government,” he added.
