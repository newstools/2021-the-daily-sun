Swallows FC coach Brandon Truter cut a relieved figure as his side snapped a nine-game winless streak to defeat bottom side Black Leopards in their DStv Premiership clash on Sunday. Swallows claimed a first win since mid-January thanks to a penalty from Ghana forward Daniel Gozar, his first goal of the campaign.   "It was a difficult game playing the bottom dwellers. They are a team that are fighting for their lives to stay in the PSL. Normally this time of the season, Leopards are the team that picks up points with their backs to the wall,” Swallows coach Brandon Truter said."We were confident playing at home and being unbeaten here, that we would get the three points. I expected a bit more goals, but it is nice for the three points and the clean sheet."They put us under pressure, but with their man-marking tactics it made it a bit easier for us in the second half as we managed to open up their midfield so many times. "The boys showed the determination, will and desire to win, so thanks to everybody. This is for the fans."Swallows moved back up to fourth, within two points of a CAF Confederation Cup qualification placed with a game in hand. They are next in action away at Bloemfontein Celtic on April 20. -SuperSport
