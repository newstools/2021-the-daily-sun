TWO event promoters have angered the family of late Infinite Boys member Raphael Mabaso, by allegedly cashing in on his untimely death. “Now that he is no more, they see an opportunity to enrich themselves through his death,” Raphael’s mother Beauty Mabaso told Daily Sun, speaking about promoters, Aaron and Mark Khoza. “We want nothing to do with them nor their money as they went against our wishes as a family.” Raphael’s family claimed that Aaron and Mark Khoza from Daveyton were apparently collecting money from people, saying they were organising a farewell for the late musician. Beauty said when the two visited the family’s home, they thought they were there to comfort them. “We have learnt that they had a pop-up party and also collected money for a farewell we know nothing about. They should have came to us and asked what we had planned.” ALSO READ | AKA ARRIVES IN DURBAN FOR FIANCEE FUNERAL She claimed the promoters were no longer close to her son. “They spoke ill of him and never booked him. When Infinite Boys were on a break, none of them came to motivate them.” Beauty said Raphael’s death left her shattered. “I have been telling myself that maybe after we have laid him to rest, I will be better. These people have caused me more grief,” she said. Raphael died on 9 April and will be buried on Saturday, 17 April. The family said they were not ready to reveal why he died. Mark said that although they have been promoting the event on their social media platforms, he has nothing to do with the pop-up party and the farewell. “I would never do such a thing. The person you should be speaking to about that is Aaron,” he said. When contacted for a comment, Aaron denied going against the Mabaso’s family wishes. “We have not been collecting money for a farewell. That is a huge lie. The DJs in Daveyton decided to play sets to honour Rapahel’s memory.”
