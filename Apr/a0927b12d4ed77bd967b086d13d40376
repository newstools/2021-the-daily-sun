ZANDILE Sibisi could have worked as a social worker. But instead, she chose to cook and sell delicious food. The 57-year-old from Orlando West, Soweto, runs a mobile kitchen called Sibisi Sisters with her three sisters, and they are well-known for their beef stew and samp. “People love it. Our stew is tender and tasty. Teeth or no teeth, you will enjoy it because it is well-cooked and the spices are well-balanced,” said Zandile. She said she was taught how to cook by her late mum, Poppy. “I wore a mini-apron whenever I helped her in the kitchen,” she said. “We prepared the meal of the day before we went to church. She showed me the A-Z of cooking. “Perhaps, that is why I have never trained as a cook.” Zandile said as a child, she knew how to make a chicken pot roast, pudding, rice and salads. “I feel sad if I do not cook for a day. Cooking is my therapy. It releases the love I have for food and the people who will eat it,” said Zandile. She said she worked as a freelance cook for other catering companies when they are not booked. “I am not jealous to share my talent with other people. I charge according to the type of a meal and number of people I will be serving on a given day,” said Zandile, who caters mostly for parties and weddings in and around Soweto.
