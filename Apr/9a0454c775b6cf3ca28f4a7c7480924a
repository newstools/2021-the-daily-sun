UNDOUBTEDLY, Gert Schalkwyk was a darling of South African football! In his heyday, the elegant attacker wowed crowds during his spell with the likes of Kaizer Chiefs, Bloemfontein Celtic, Orlando Pirates, Maritzburg United and Santos. He also had a spell in Cyprus where he played for Bostangi Bagcil. The industrious player who had the ability to operate as central attacking midfielder and striker made a mark in most of the team that he played for in the PSL. At Chiefs he had a memorable combination with David "DVD" Mathebula during Ernest Midderndrop days and later with Jose Torrealba in 2008-2009 season.  At Celtic he played with the likes of Tlou Segolela, Patrick Malokase and Mark Mayambela. In his playing career Schalkwyk won a lot of trophies, the 2004 Coca-Cola Cup, 2004-2005 Castle Premiership League, 2006 Absa Cup, 2006 SAA Supa 8, 2007 Telkom Knockout Cup and 2008 MTN 8 Cup with Amakhosi. At Pirates he won the 2010 MTN 8 Cup.  He also represented the national team at senior level and Under-23.
