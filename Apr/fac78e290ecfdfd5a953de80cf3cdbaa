FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns left-back Lovers Mohlala was involved in a horrific car accident after hitting two cows on Friday night. Mohlala, according to the pictures he shared on his social media account, was declared to be dead. The former Bafana Bafana defender's VW Polo TSI's bonnet was left smashed but he came out unscathed. The other sides of the car were also left damaged. “God, you are the greatest. Thanks for taking care of me. You just saved my life; two cows and one is dead, one badly hurt. I’m still alive, I believe.”  Mohlala is one of the Mzansi’s footballers who was known to be a troublemaker during his playing days. But he hasn’t been shy to talk openly about it to the current generation of players. As talented and marauding left-back as he was, having played for Wits University, Jomo Cosmos (twice), Aris Thessaloniki Silver Stars, Moroka Swallows, AmaZulu and Black Leopards, Mohlala represented the national team at all levels. He earned nine caps for Bafana. Mohlala had a successful stay with Tshwane giants Sundowns. He was part of the Masandawana side that won three league titles on the bounce between 1997 to 2000. He also claimed the Bob Save Super Bowl in 1997-08 season in what was Mohlala’s first season with Sundowns. The other was Rothmans Cup in 1999-00 before he departed at the end of 2002-03 season to return to Ezenkosi.
