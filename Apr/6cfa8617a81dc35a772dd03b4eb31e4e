STRIPPER Noluvuyo “Bubbly” Sodela recently turned 28. And she had a special birthday cake decorated with a 4-5 for her fans. She celebrated her birthday at Tsitsikamma Sea in the Eastern Cape on Saturday, 24 April. The former Generations: The Legacy actress told Daily Sun the cake was a way to show appreciation to her fans. “My fans have been supporting my stripping business since I quit acting in 2016. They are the ones who make sure I put bread on the table for my family.” She said her fans supported all her crazy ideas. “Many people lost their jobs because of Covid-19. “I had to strip on digital platforms and came up with the Stay at Home Movement to encourage men to stay home and have fun,” said Bubbly. “I had to go to Joburg in December when Nelson Mandela Bay was put on hard lockdown in order to make ends meet,” said Bubbly. She later returned home and decided to dye her hair and punani blonde in order to make dollars on digital platforms. “My idea worked. Without my loyal fans that would be impossible. “I am very happy, hence I decided to give them this special cake with a 4-5,” she told the People’s Paper. Bubbly said she was amazed by the support and reaction from her fans, and Mzansi celebrities. “I received roses, chocolates and an appreciation letter from someone who’s crushing on me. “I also received some cash from friends because they said it’s hard to buy me a present. “I received messages from Thembi Seete, Sana Mchunu and Sicelo Buthelezi from Mzansi Magic’s Gomora. I also received a gift from one of my fans in Germany,” she said. In a joint video message, Sana and Sicelo sang happy birthday to Bubbly. Sana said: “Your cake. Please give me some of it. I want it please.” Bubbly’s fans also wished her a happy birthday on social media.
