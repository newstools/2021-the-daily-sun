A GRADE 12 pupil from Ga-Matlala, Limpopo, who assaulted a fellow classmate with a tree branch while on their way home, could find herself in trouble. This is because the provincial education department has demanded a detailed report from the school principal after a violent video clip went viral on social media. Last Wednesday after school, pupils were on their way home when all hell broke loose. It is alleged that the aggressive female pupil with a tree branch claimed her fellow classmate had passed subliminal remarks that she had aborted her pregnancy. Limpopo education spokeswoman Tidimalo Chuene said they were aware of a recording of a physical altercation incident involving pupils from the school making the rounds. Chuene to Daily Sun: “We strongly condemn such conduct and to that effect, the director of Mogalakwena education district has requested a full report from the principal on due disciplinary processes. “It’s quite disturbing to witness this level of violent behaviour among young people. We’re expecting this to happen as soon as possible. Our psychosocial team will also be dispatched to the school to attend to affected learners.” Other pupils from the school, who spoke to Daily Sun, said the violent girl was just a bully who had been failing grades repeatedly. “She acts like a boss to almost every learner. We’re even afraid of reporting her because if she finds out, she’ll make you pay. She believes that no one can do anything to her as she has been at the school for a long time. What she did really left us terrified because now we know that she is capable of doing anything horrible,” a pupil said. The victim’s mother said she was heartbroken and disturbed after seeing the video, and that the family was still discussing a way forward against the alleged bully.
