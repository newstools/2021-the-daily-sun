JUNIOR Khanye has seen and done it all. He has lived the fast life, driven some of the nicest cars and been with some of the most beautiful women. He has owned some of the best houses and worn some of the most expensive clothes. But he would trade all of that in a heartbeat for the life he is currently living. It might not be as extravagant and lavish as it was when he was at the peak of his career but it is more fulfilling, according to the 35-year-old. The former Kaizer Chiefs star, known as one of the “bad boys” of Mzansi football, has turned over a new leaf in recent years. He has gotten his act together and is leading a life he hopes will bring pride to his loved ones. He has gone from “down and out” to being one of the most vocal soccer analysts in the country with his opinions always eagerly anticipated by fans across Mzansi. Khanye consistently provides accurate predictions and analysis on YouTube. This led to widespread adoration from PSL fans on Twitter. But what does a regular day in his life look like these days? He welcomed SunSport into his mother’s house where he now stays and gave a clear picture. “I’m in a good place now, I’m back at home and I have everything going for me again. It’s like I have been given a second chance in life,” said Khanye. “These days I live a simple life, my brother. I don’t have a lot of friends because that how you end up making a lot of mistakes and these so-called friends are nowhere to be seen. “I just stay with my mom, my kids and my niece. I wake up and take a bath and then I take my car to the car wash and come back home to watch TV if I’m not working. “I also spend a lot of time training young players who play for my team, Fak'imali Uzobona FC”
