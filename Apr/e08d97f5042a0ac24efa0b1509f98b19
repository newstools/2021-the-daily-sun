PARLIAMENT has moved a step closer in determining whether Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane gets to keep her job or vacate her office. Speaker Thandi Modise was on Tuesday, 6 March provided with names of 26 people who’ll decide the fate of the embattled public protector. The committee is made up of members of different political parties and, of the 26 members, 11 have voting powers, among them EFF leader Julius Malema. Malema has publicly voiced his support for Mkhwebane. The committee follows voting last month by the National Assembly to establish the structure to further probe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office as recommended by an independent panel, which found the public protector had a case to answer. The panel was mandated to look into the matter by Modise after the DA tabled a motion to impeach Mkhwebane, citing several court judgments that went against her. The National Assembly voted overwhelmingly with 275 in favour of the inquiry committee and 40 against. The proceedings laid bare deep divisions within the ANC when the battle between the two factions played themselves out in the public, with secretary-general Ace Magashule vowing the governing party would not vote with the enemy. But President Cyril Ramaphosa’s faction won the day when party chairman Gwede Mantashe told the ANC caucus to toe the party line. That resulted in 62 ANC MPs not taking part in the vote. Parliament has reached a second stage in determining Mkhwebane’s fate, with the 26 members to make up the Section 194 Committee to decide whether there are grounds to remove Mkhwebane. The committee must now establish the veracity of the charges and report back to the National Assembly and, if the recommendation is that Mkhwebane must be removed from office, the matter will be put directly to a vote.
