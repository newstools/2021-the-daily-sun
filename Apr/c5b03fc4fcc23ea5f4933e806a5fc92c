MAMELODI Sundowns will be favourites to defend their Nedbank Cup title. Very few could argue with the prediction, following their 4-1 crushing of Orlando Pirates at Loftus Stadium on Thursday, the Brazilians can only be their worst enemies. The Brazilians have made a habit of humiliating the Buccaneers at Loftus Stadium and it was no different as they marched to the Nedbank Cup semifinal where they will face Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivandila on Sunday. Goals from Peter Shalulile, Themba Zwane as well as substitutes, Lesedi Kapinga and Hlompho Kekana accounted for the comprehensive win. In fact, the scoreline could have been 5-1… even six were Manqoba Mngqithi’s men more clinical in front of goal. Who could forget the 6-0 defeat at the same venue four years ago? Shalulile opened the scoring early on, before Tshegofatso Mabasa justified his place in the Bucs starting line-up with an equalizer, minutes after the half-hour mark. But as Downs turned on the heat, Bucs coach Josef Zinnbauer had to put on his spectacles to believe what he was seeing. His boys looked punch-drunk as the home side exuded quality with pace on the break, unity of purpose and resilience.  Zwane, by far the man of the match, danced his way into the box, latched on Shalulile’s loose pass to finish off for the second goal.  Kapinga came off the bench to thunder in the third in the 78th minute and watched in awe as veteran Kekana rammed in low past Wayne Sandilands for the fourth on the stroke of full time. As Zinnbauer admitted afterwards, Sundowns are just on another level.
