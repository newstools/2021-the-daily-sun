THE offices
of Shepherd Bushiri’s South African lawyer, Advocate Terrence Baloyi, have
allegedly been broken into. It is
reported the incident happened on Wednesday, 7 April, while Baloyi was in
Malawi to attend the burial of Bushiri’s daughter Israella, who died two weeks
ago. It is
reported that among the stolen items was a a laptop and the Central Processing
Unit of his desktop computer. Baloyi has
since opened a case of burglary and theft at Brooklyn Police Station, Tshwane. According
to the reports, Baloyi told the police he arrived at his workplace in the
morning and found four windows with their burglars forced open and a Dell
laptop worth R6 000 taken from one of the offices. Baloyi told
the media in Malawi that he could confirm his offices were broken into and the
two items were taken. “The law
enforcement agencies broke into my vehicle and stole my laptop about three
years ago. I hope this time around it is not them,” he said. Gauteng
police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed that a case of burglary and
theft has been opened and no arrests have been made as investigations are
underway. Baloyi is
currently suing the police for R15 million for an alleged unlawful arrest that
happened earlier this year.
