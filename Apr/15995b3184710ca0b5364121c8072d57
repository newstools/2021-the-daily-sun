It’s very infuriating how young girls self-destruct. Some girls are no longer ambitious, driven or visionary. They live in the now, almost as if there’s no future. They spend their days planning the next party, what they’re going to drink or wear, and who’s going to pay for that. Men can buy you all the alcohol you want just to get you drunk and take advantage of you. Many rape cases reported among young girls in South Africa are the result of reckless binge drinking. Alcohol is one of the leading causes of car crashes, teenage pregnancies, as well as HIV and other STIs and evil men can use it to rape girls. Kidnappers and human traffickers mostly target vulnerable, drunk girls. Alcohol also damages the brain. It’s far worse when a young girl whose brain is still developing drinks large amounts of alcohol. The problem is that alcohol has become a lifestyle in South Africa. You’re seen as boring and as a misfit when you don’t drink alcohol. We need to remember that women are the most powerful creatures in the universe. - Letter by Rolle, Thulamahashe
