BAFANA Bafana has had a chequered relationship with Congo since South Africa first played them in a Fifa World Cup qualifier at home on 24 October 1992. I have some bad memories of visiting Congo’s coastal town of Pointe Noire where Bafana played their matches. Mark Fish was brutalised by Congo players when we played in a vital 1998 World Cup qualifier in dusty Pointe Noire on 6 April 1997. Fish looked like he had stepped out of a war zone, with his bloody face heavily bruised after the match. As media we also suffered, but not nearly as badly as Fish. I and two other journalists were forced to sleep on the hotel manager’s floor for the weekend. It was explained that as the hotel was a small, they were “overbooked”. Our rooms, which were booked, were not available when we tried to check in. That was a bad start to the weekend and it got worse when Fish was hurt and Bafana were beaten 2-0. I was keen to savage the Congo and their lack of hospitality when I arrived back to my Joburg daily newspaper, and I wrote the story. But when Congo returned for the second leg at FNB Stadium in August that year, all hell broke loose. I was assigned to cover Congo’s arrival at the Joburg International, now the OR Tambo Airport. And if we thought the bad blood between the sides was over, think again! Congo started a war at the airport all on their own. They refused the accommodation Safa had organised for them and demanded to be put up in a luxury hotel in Sandton. But more was to come from the unsporting Congolese. They arrived an hour late at the FNB Stadium on match day for the vital qualifier which would decide who would qualify for the 1998 World Cup in France. Bafana needed a win to reach the World Cup for the first time. My favourite Bafana player, the late Phil “Chippa” Masinga, scored that wonder goal that gave Bafana a 1-0 win and a place in France ’98. Sadly Chippa is no longer with us. RIP Chippa.
