THE Bajaj Qute is the most talked about car in Mzansi right now. Well, most of Mzansi knows it as the Chipi after a video of a white Bajaj Qute made the rounds on social media trying to do doughnuts and things went south. Now let’s talk facts, the Bajaj Qute isn’t classified as a car – it is a quadricycle. Its engine is mounted at the back and is a rear-wheel-drive quadricycle that seats four passengers. It is made by Indian company Bajaj Auto and was aimed primarily at the Indian domestic market. The Bajaj is the first four-wheeler manufactured by Bajaj Auto, which was unveiled in 2012.  In South Africa, the Qute is powered by a four-stroke twin spark-ignition, single-cylinder liquid-cooled engine that is good for 9.70KW at 5500 RPM. The little car doesn’t cost R5 500 as people on social media have suggested. It retails for R75 000 in Mzansi, according to the Bajaj Auto website.
