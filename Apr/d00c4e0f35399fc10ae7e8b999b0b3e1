WHILE Uzalo is still trying
to recover from losing so many lead actors in a short time, it has just lost
another senior star. Nyalleng
Thibedi has revealed she is leaving Mzansi’s most-watched soapie. Uzalo fans were shocked when big guns like Dawn
Thandeka King, who played popular gangster Lindiwe “Ma Ngcobo” Ngcobo were
leaving. Baby
Cele and Siyabonga Shibe have completely left, while Dawn and Jet Novuka have
left but are still appearing on TV and are expected to be gone soon. Nyalleng
played Zekhethelo, the controversial stepdaughter of number one gangster
Nkunzebomvu Mhlongo, played by Masoja Msiza. “Yes
I’m leaving Uzalo,”
she told Daily Sun. She
joined the Durban-based production in 2017. ALSO READ: AKA ARRIVES IN DURBAN FOR FUNERAL “I’m
not sure when my final episode will be because the writing is not completed. “At
the moment I will not share where I’m going but I will let you know in due
course.” Uzalo has have been forced to bring back former big
guns to spice up the show. Khaya
Dladla, who plays GC and Nokuthula Mabika, who plays Thobile are already back. It
is expected that Ntokozo Dlamini, who played Mastermind, and Naymaps Maphalala,
who played Mxolisi, will also be returning. Inside sources told Daily Sun the main reason many
actors are leaving Uzalo is because the production always has problems with
payment. “Many times actors don’t get paid on time and many times they
can’t pay bills while the production is sorting its problems, said the source.
“As much as they are bringing back their old actors, many actors will be
exiting the show.” Uzalo publicist Nomfundo Zondi said she couldn’t confirm
whether Nyalleng was leaving. “The writing team is still crafting the show. We
will update once I am able to confirm,” she said.
