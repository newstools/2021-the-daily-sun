THE thieves were busy loading the stolen cables into a vehicle when the cops arrived and caught them red-handed. The four suspects, aged between 37 and 55, were caught on the railway line along Station Street in Heidelberg on Wednesday. They are facing charges of possession of suspected stolen goods. Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate said the suspects were spotted by a private security guard stealing the railway line along Station Street and reported it to the police. The quick response of the Heidelberg Crime Prevention team led to the arrest of the suspects. Cops found that some of the cables were already loaded into a car. The copper cables are estimated to be worth thousands of rands. The cables and the motor vehicle were seized. The suspects will appear in Heidelberg Magistrates Court soon.
