WITH the latest Covid-19 wave sweeping through India, killing at least 2 000 people a day, the crematoriums in that country are struggling to deal with the influx of corpses. Bodies remain on the floor for up to 20 hours, waiting for the their turn to be cremated. In a video that was apparently taken from one of the crematoriums, scores of corpses can been seen lying unattended on the floor in the scorching sun, while others are being cremated outside. “I have not seen such a bad situation ever before in my life. People are moving with bodies of their loved ones from pillar to post. Almost all Delhi crematoriums are flooded with bodies,” Vineeta Massey, owner of Massey Funerals, told Times of India. The publication further reported that apart from the trauma of losing a loved ones, there was more grief in store for relatives who were not even able to give them a proper send-off. “They arrive at crematoriums with bodies, only to be turned away. They drive to another facility, and yet another, traversing the city with the mortal remains in personal cars or ambulances, desperately seeking a graceful exit for their father, mother, son or daughter from the material world. The trauma is no less for the relatives of those who died of non-Covid-19 causes but are being swept up in the collective national tragedy driven by the pandemic.”
