WHEN one door closes, another one opens. That’s what happened to Stained Glass former spokeswoman Ayanda Mthiyane. She left the production company that produces Uzalo and she is a superstar in the making. Ayanda now plays Mzion, a dangerous inmate on e.tv’s Imbewu. Although sources claimed she was allegedly fired from the production house, Ayanda sings a different tune. She said she left because she wanted to explore other opportunities in the entertainment industry. “I’m a workaholic. I enjoy keeping myself busy. And what I like about the entertainment industry is that there are many opportunities. That’s why I’m acting today. I grab every opportunity that comes my way,” she said.

She has been in the industry for a long time and I have so much respect for her. I also had to get off my comfort zone and portray a woman who believes she is in control. It is challenging but I don’t want to fail in anything I do,” she said. Ayanda said working for a big production house such as Stained Glass worked to her advantage. “I learned a lot from the company. I would watch how actors conducted themselves during shoots. That helped me to become an actress. I want to spread my wings and get bigger roles. I know God will make it happen,” she said.
