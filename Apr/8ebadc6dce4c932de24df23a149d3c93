Two drunk friends were left with swollen 4-5s after injecting each other with a cream. The two friends reportedly heard that the cream could give them extra thickness. The men in their 30s watched a YouTube “tutorial” that offered bogus tips on how they could get bigger 4-5s. It told them to inject themselves with an anti-hematoma cream sometimes used to treat piles in order to boost the size of their 4-5. But instead of experimenting on themselves, they decided to inject each other. According to the Daily Mail, doctors who treated the unidentified duo revealed they suffered from progressive painful swelling of the 4-5 during the night and went to hospital the next morning. Both men complained it hurt when the paramedics touched their 4-5s to inspect the damage. Paramedics feared the cream blocked the lymph vessels in the 4-5s, stopping the body from naturally clearing excess fluid and causing them to swell. Both men were told to rest and take painkillers, in the hope the swelling would go down on its own. But the dermatologists at the Strasbourg University Hospital have no idea if the men have permanently damaged their 4-5s because of their drunken experiment.
