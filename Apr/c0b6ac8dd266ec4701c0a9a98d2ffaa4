IF you have a DSTV decoder installed in your home, then you will be familiar with the term “self-service”. DSTV recently introduced a self-service platform where one can pay your monthly subscriptions, check balances and upgrade your price plan. Speaking of taking matters into your own hands, masturbation follows the same analogy. By definition, masturbation is the art of pleasuring yourself without physically engaging in sex. Now, one might assume that married people shouldn’t be doing this, right? Well, according to statistics, more and more married couples are taking the matters of pleasure into their own hands. According to Very Well Mind magazine, it’s not unusual for people to masturbate in addition to having regular sex with their partners. For some couples, masturbation is both an enjoyable solo and shared activity with other people, reporting that they would be aroused if they found out their partner was masturbating. Two main theories have been promoted about the relationship between masturbation and partnered sex. The complementary theory proposes that people masturbate within a relationship to enhance their partnered sex. So, masturbation might increase and improve partnered sex. In contrast, the compensatory model suggests that people in relationships masturbate as a means to substitute sexual desires, whether in quantity, quality or type that go unmet within the relationship.
