AMAZULU are set to reward their veteran striker Lehlohonolo Majoro with a new contract. Majoro returned to Usuthu at the beginning of last season and at that time he signed a two-year deal after leaving Bidvest Wits. However, that deal will expire at the end of this term. But AmaZulu are already making plans to keep the 34-year-old striker, who scored both goals when Usuthu beat TS Galaxy 2-1 in a DStv Premiership fixture played in Durban last weekend. Those two goals, in addition to his goal against Cape Town City on Wednesday, have seen the former Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs striker go top of the club’s goal scoring chart with eight league goals after 20 games, one ahead of Luvuyo Memela. “Our intention is definitely to keep Majoro and we have made it clear to him through his agent,” said club president Sandile Zungu. “I know the coach speaks very highly of him and so do we.” Coach Benni McCarthy spoke glowingly of Majoro after scoring those two goals, saying that’s why he has played for big clubs in the PSL. Apart from playing for Chiefs, Pirates and Wits, Majoro also played for the Citizens under McCarthy. Throughout Majoro’s professional career, the Mpumalanga-born finisher has won one league title, two Nedbank Cups and the Telkom Knockout trophy. “He’s got an exceptional attitude and that has augured well for Usuthu’s fighting spirit. It fits our strategy,” added Zungu. AmaZulu is the club that gave Majoro his PSL debut in the 2010-11 season under Manqoba Mngqithi. He scored 14 league goals in 27 appearances, forcing Chiefs to shell out big money to sign in. His outstanding form has seen McCarthy overlooking Bonginkosi Ntuli, who was the club’s go to man last season when the team survived relegation. Majoro’s form has also helped Usuthu surprisingly challenge for the league title this season.
