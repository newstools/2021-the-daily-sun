TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) received a major boost ahead of their DStv Premiership clash against Bloemfontein Celtic at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday afternoon (3pm). They welcome back five regular players from injury. The players are Alfred Ndengane, Brandon Theron, Diamond Thopola, Edgar Manaka and Thabo Mnyamane. All these trusted stars were badly missed in Tshakhuma’s 3-0 defeat to Cape Town City in a league encounter at Cape Town Stadium last week. The last time these players played was in TTM’s 6-5 penalty shoot-out win over Mamelodi Sundowns following a goalless draw after 120 minutes in the Nedbank Cup semi-final, nine days ago. “We are expecting a tough game, but we have to show the same character we did against Sundowns,” said Tshakhuma coach Dylan Kerr, who will again watch this clash from the stands again as his work permit has not yet been issued by Home Affairs. “The good thing is that the lads who missed the Cape Town City game are back. This is a huge boost for us. We missed these guys. All the players who missed last week’s game are experienced and we need them to help us move away from the relegation zone.” Added Kerr: “The other good thing is that every player wants to show the technical team that they deserve to play in the Nedbank final against Chippa United on 8 May. “And to play in the final, you have to do well in the league. “I am pleased with the attitude and the commitment these lads are showing at training. I am positive we will get a good result against Celtic.” However, the Venda-based side will still be without the services of former Bafana Bafana striker Tokelo Rantie who has flu, and suspended defender Ayanda Nkili. The 30-year-old former Sundowns star Rantie also missed last week’s trip to the Mother City, with interim coach Mpho Maleka using Thembisani Nevhulamba and Farai Madhanaga in attack.
