Khandashisa was released late last year. “With this song I wanted to give my fans a bit of fun and something extraordinary,” he said. Uthando, released last month, was inspired by true love. According to TyraQeed, it’s an appreciation song. “It promises to give unconditional love and attention to our loved ones. “The song is also educational in the sense that it helps young men to see their partners not just as girlfriends but as potential mothers and even future wives.’’ It warns against gender-based violence.
