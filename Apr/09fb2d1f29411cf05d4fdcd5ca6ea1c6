KAIZER Chiefs legend, Moffat Mofoka’s remains will be exhumed after his family recently learnt they had buried him in the wrong place. As per his wishes, his family buried him in 2006 on top of his dad Leluma, who was laid to rest at Roodepoort Cemetery near Dobsonville in Soweto. Yesterday, the Mofoka and Mokate families met at the cemetery to confirm if Moffat had indeed been buried on top of his father. But it was confirmed he was buried in the wrong grave. Moffat’s sister, Dibusetso, said: “We were not here to exhume his body today, but to check if indeed Moffat was buried on top of ntate. We made an affidavit (to apply for exhumation) and we will take it to City Parks to get the exhumation date.” She said the almost identical grave numbers led to the mistake. Moffat’s grave number is 1569, while Hope’s 1659. “The Mokate family alerted us of the mistake.” She blamed the undertaker for giving them the wrong grave number. Hope’s sister, Tsholo, told the People’s Paper they discovered the mix-up in September when they went to visit the grave of Hope, who was buried in 2001. “We couldn’t locate his grave. My mum knew the grave number and took it to the office. A worker pointed us to the grave with a tombstone. We were shocked as we’ve never put a tombstone. When the worker looked through the file, he told us there was a reopening in 2006.” She said before contacting the Mofokas, a worker gave them the runaround until the issue was escalated in the media. City Parks senior manager, Reggie Moloi said: “The first burial happened in 2000 when this cemetery still belonged to the old Roodepoort. We took over later. All these things that are happening, we take responsibility because are in charge.” He said the exhumation process is underway and could take about two weeks if all documentation has been submitted.
