KAIZER Chiefs are determined to turn their season around. They displayed impressive character to avoid suffering their seventh defeat of the season against Stellenbosch FC. The two sides put on a show in the second half of their 2-2 draw in a DStv Premiership clash played at an empty FNB Stadium yesterday. Chiefs had to come from behind on two occasions as they fought hard to maintain their recent form. The Glamour Boys have been in good form of late, looking to salvage what has generally been a poor season by their standards. But Gavin Hunt’s charges seem to be eager to turn the corner. Amakhosi are now unbeaten in their last four matches in all competitions having recorded morale-boosting 1-0 victories over Orlando Pirates and Wydad Athletic in their last two outings before meeting Stellies. Their other two matches prior were back-to-back 1-1 draws against SuperSport United and Maritzburg United. They are looking to finish in the top eight after their hopes of winning the league were blown away a while back. But the Stellies draw left Amakhosi where they started the match, in ninth place behind TS Galaxy who occupy the final top eight position. Chiefs have collected 24 points from 20 matches, well below what was expected from last season’s runners up. They were almost handed another defeat after Nathan Sinkala opened the scoring in the 72nd minute. But substitute Leonardo Castro managed to draw Chiefs level with a headed goal in the 77th minute. It seemed like doom and gloom when Stellies’ Phathutshedzo Nange regained the lead but Chiefs fought back again through Nkosingiphile Ngcobo’s strike. Stellies will feel like they blew a huge opportunity having been in front on two occasions but they could not hang on to their lead. They remain in 10th with 23 points from 21 matches.They next face AmaZulu at Danie Craven Stadium on Friday (5pm) while Chiefs are back in Caf Champions League action against Horoya FC at General Lansana Conté Stadium on Saturday (9pm).
