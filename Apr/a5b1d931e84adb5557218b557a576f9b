LOOK at us now because of the ANC! And the lesson here is: beware of thinking that our current politics is a mess, because it can get worse. Here is a nightmare scenario for supporters of President Cyril Ramaphosa, who thought that after his triumph, state capture would finally be put behind us. It was hoped that Jacob Zuma would be confined to the dustbin of history, a jail cell or both. It was also hoped he would take his gang of supporters with him, away from key positions where they had been deployed to further the state capture project. Yet, after lying low for a few years and watching as Ramaphosa struggled with the poisoned chalice of the after-effects of looting, his opponents are starting to make open play for power. To keep Ramaphosa’s supporters awake at night, in the immortal words of Malusi Gigaba, imagine this! – a future roll of presidential candidates headed by Duduzane Zuma. They are openly starting to campaign, and that should worry every right-thinking citizen. We are heading for a world of pain, more suffering and chaos – all because our president is glued to this fictitious dream of a united ANC. What will Ramaphosa achieve by trying to put new wine in an old skin? Nothing! Bushy Green, Kagiso
