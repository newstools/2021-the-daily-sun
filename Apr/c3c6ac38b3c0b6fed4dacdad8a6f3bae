GRIEVING Bella Morake (41) says the Tshwane Metro Police Department has taken something very special from her. Her husband, Doctor Setlai (51), from Amanda Park in Leeufontein in Tshwane was killed allegedly by Metro police on Tuesday night in Bavianspoort, Tshwane. Bella told Daily Sun her husband was attending a community meeting in Amanda Park. “At night I heard gunshots and my husband was not picking up his phone,” she said. She said when she went to the place where her husband told her he would be, she found him covered with a plastic. Bella recognised him by his shoes. Doctor finished paying lobola in January and the couple was planning to host white weddings in Brits, North West and Siyabuswa in Mpumalanga this year. WATCH: MAGWINGA DOUGH, FEET SHOCK! Residents leader Thabo Moshebelo said on Tuesday morning, 13 April Metro police cut down the main supply of illegal connections in Bavianspoort. “At night a group of angry residents wanted to reconnect the cables and were ambushed in the dark. The Metro cops shot randomly and fatally killed a resident who was walking home from a meeting and had nothing to do with the quarrel. He died on the scene,” he said Tshwane Metro police Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said TMPD members had a joint operation with the SAPS and the Electricity Department regarding illegal connections in Leeufontein. He said the officers tried to disperse the crowd by firing rubber bullets. “The crowd ran in different directions and when the crowd was cleared, one community member was lying unresponsive on the ground,” he said. Mahamba said TMPD was investigating the case internally and a case of murder was also opened and is being investigated by the police and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.
