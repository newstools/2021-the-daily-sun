STELLENBOSH FC coach Steve Barker was disappointed after his side surrendered the lead twice against Kaizer Chiefs. Stellies had Amakhosi right where they wanted them twice in the game, but on both occasions, they could not hold on. The Cape Winelands outfit was forced to settle for a 2-2 draw at the FNB Stadium on Tuesday. Goals by Nathan Sinkala and Phathutshedzo Nange were cancelled out by strikes from Leonardo Castro and Nkosingiphile Ngcobo. Barker believes his side deserved better but was content with what they got in the end. “There is obviously disappointment having led the game twice,” said Barker. “In the last three matches, we have conceded late allowed teams to get points from us. But one can look at the glass half full and say that we are disappointed and it's not good enough or we can look at the glass full in that we are a team that’s only in their second season in the top-flight. “We have come away to Kaizer Chiefs and we are disappointed that we did not win. We were also disappointed against Mamelodi Sundowns and SuperSport United and that shows the strides that we have made as a team. “As much as we are disappointed, we have to look at the positives. Chiefs are one score draw away from competing with the best teams in Africa. Sundowns are one of the best in Africa. What is disappointing is that we are getting close but not quite there. But it’s something we can fix.”
