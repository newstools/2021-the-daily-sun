MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi believes his side is not too far from their reaching one of their big goals of the season. The Tshwane giants, who are fighting on numerous fronts hoping to finish with as many trophies as possible, are still on course to achieve. They took another step toward defending their league title with a 2-1 win over struggling Chippa United at Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Monday. They stretched their lead at the top of the DStv Premiership table to six points, pulling further clear of the chasing pack. “Any win at this stage of the season is very important because it takes closer to the bigger goal,” said Mngqithi. “You are starting to count how many matches you need to win to retain the top spot and elude the chasers. “We are getting closer to where we want to be. No one would have anticipated that we would be where we are at this point of the season. But we still believe we can still do better. Mnqithi admitted, however, that things are beginning to get tough and they will need to up their game to get through this tricky period at the latter stages of the season. The Chilli Boys, who are second from the bottom in the standings, did not make things easy for Downs. “It’s always going to be tough at this stage of the season,” added Mngqithi. “We knew that this commotion of not having a coach would make it difficult for us to profile them. “But fortunately, our analysts did a good job and the game came out the way we wanted it to come out. “If we were a little bit shrewd, we would have wrapped the game up sooner. But we are encouraged that we have won another critical match at a critical time of the season. “These away matches when there’s a huge game coming up are always difficult to manage but we did well.
