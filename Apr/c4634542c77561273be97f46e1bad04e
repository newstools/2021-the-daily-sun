PRINCE Misuzulu Zulu (46) has been instructed to use the three-month mourning period to find a wife before he takes the throne. A source said it was obvious that he would be the next Zulu king, but the biggest challenge was his marital status. “He has three months to decide who will be the lucky lady, because he can’t get married while the royal house is still in mourning,” said the source. The source said the prince had a son, and it was possible for him to marry the mother. Zulu cultural expert Dr Gugu Mazibuko from the University of KwaZulu-Natal told Daily Sun this was not the first time a king’s successor was given time to get married before taking the throne. “The late King Zwelithini was also given time to get married before his coronation in 1971. His father King Bhekuzulu died in 1968, and King Zwelithini was given time to get married to his first wife, Queen Sibongile Dlamini in 1969,” she said. Mazibuko said she would not refer to this as Zulu culture, as it depended on the current monarch. “King Shaka was not married when he led the nation, and he didn’t get married. King Bhekuzulu was married when his father died.” Prince Misuzulu is Queen Mantfombi MaDlamini Zulu’s eldest son. He has special status, as his father was the king and his mother is from the eSwatini royal house.
