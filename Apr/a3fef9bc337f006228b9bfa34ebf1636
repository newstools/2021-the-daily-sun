THE mineral resources department briefed Parliament virtually yesterday on efforts to bring independent power producers on board to help bring more power. In March, Minister Gwede Mantashe announced preferred bidders to alleviate electricity supply constraints and to reduce the extensive use of diesel. “It’s important to note the three bidders are within the 2 000MW capacity threshold in terms of the evaluation rankings, but their announcement can only be made following satisfactory value for money propositions.” He also announced the preferred bidders included ACWA Power Project DAO, Karpowership SA Coega, Karpowership SA Richards Bay, Karpowership SA Saldanha, Mulilo Total Coega, Mulilo Total Hydra Storage, Oya Energy Hybrid Facility and Umoyilanga Energy. Mantashe said solutions provided by preferred bidders were from a combination of a range of technologies that include Solar PV, wind, liquified natural gas and battery storage. But the announcement was met with bashing by MPs. DA MP Kevin Mileham asked why power ships which are a rather dirty solution are preferable to the renewable solutions. ANC MP Sibusiso Kula questioned the 20-year contracts. He wanted to understand what that says about the depth of Mzansi’s power crisis. Director-general Thabo Mokoena said no contracts had been signed.
