NKOSINATHI Hanabe was handed two life terms by the East London High Court on Thursday, 22 April for the rape and murder of a four-year-old girl. The 37-year-old raped the little girl before dumping her body in the bushes behind his shack. Hanabe and the girl were neighbours in Palana location, in Mooiplaas outside East London, when Hanabe committed the crimes. The girl was reported missing in December 2019. The community and police immediately searched for her. Following his arrest, community members burnt down Nkosinathi’s shack. He wa s refused bail and had been in custody since his arrest. Captain Mluleki Mbi said Hanabe comforted the child’s mother as he was their neighbour. He diverted the search team away from where the little girl’s body was eventually found. Mbi said a search dog led police to Hanabe’s shack, where the girl’s bloodstained clothes was found. Hanabe pointed out the spots where he hid the girl’s body, which was wrapped in a refuse bag. The girl’s family welcomed the sentence. The child’s mother, who can’t be named because the child was a victim of rape, told the People’s Paper: “For what he did he doesn’t deserve to live among people. He took my little girl away from me. He deserves to rot in jail.”
