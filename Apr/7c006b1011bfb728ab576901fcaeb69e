SOUTH African top referee Victor Gomes has continued to set the bar high after he was appointed among officials to officiate at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics in Japan. Gomes will be the second SA referee to officiate at the Olympics, following Jerome Damon's footsteps, who appeared at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Gomes said he was excited about the appointment while thanking SA Football Association and his colleagues for constantly pushing him to raise his standards, not only on the African continent but also on the world. "Being invited to officiate at the Tokyo Olympic Games is a huge honour for me," Gomes quoted by the Safa website. "I am grateful to Safa, Caf and Fifafor this recognition. "This is the pinnacle point in my career and another step closer to my targets. "I will need to put in some extra work as I'll not only be representing myself, but my family and the whole of Mzansi alongside the African continent." The games are set to run from 23 July to 8 August 2021. Safa's chair of the referees' committee, Natasha Tsichlas said Gomes' appointment once again showed South Africa's officials are among some of the best on the continent. "The high number of our officials appointed to officiate in global showpieces is an indication of the high standards of our football officials," Tsichlas said. "We also have a number of upcoming referees who will look at the likes of Gomes for inspiration and guidance. "I would like to thank SAFA president Danny Jordaan's leadership for continuing to produce world-class administrators and officials," Tsichlas added.
