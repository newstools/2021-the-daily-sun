A FAMILY from Langa kasi in Cape Town lost their belongings in a fire. Thembeni Ndaba (57) went out to buy chicken and when she came back everything was destroyed. “I was at home for the whole day, then at about 4.30pm I decided to go buy chicken that I sell. When I came back everything was destroyed,” she said. Thembeni saw firefighters rushing to her area but she didn’t think it was her house burning. “Vutha destroyed everything. My neighbours told me that the fire was fighting back. That’s why they could not save anything,” she said. She said she can’t think of anyone who might want to kill her. “Someone out there is trying to kill me and my family. The fire was supposed to happen while I was still there, but my ancestors saved me. I was not going to buy meat that day but something said to me I must leave the house,” said Thembeni. She said people can be so cruel. “To those who want to kill me, they must know that I’m very poor. I’m just trying to make a living by selling chicken. They must leave me alone.” She’s pleading for assistance from anyone who can help her. “I lost everything. I’m only left with what I was wearing. I’m asking SunReaders to assist with anything,” said Thembeni. Family member Gwen Ndlazi (38) said she tried to rush home, but it was too late. “I received a call from one of my friends telling me about the incident. She said they were trying to control the fire but it was too strong,” said Gwen. She said if it was a normal fire, residents could’ve killed the blaze. “The fire started from the couch. There was no stove or anything that could’ve caused the fire,” said Gwen. Resident Thembeka Nkomo (43) said they wanted to save the furniture, but they could not risk their lives. “The heat from the flames was so intense and we watched as everything went up in smoke.”
