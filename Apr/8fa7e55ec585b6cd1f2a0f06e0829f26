THE good news for Kaizer Chiefs is that they will soon be able to recruit new players, post their Fifa transfer ban. However, the arrival of new faces is likely to spell the end of the road for some, including veteran Willard Katsande, whose contract ends in June. But he is not the only one... WILLARD KATSANDE His contract with Amakhosi was extended by a season in January last year, but he will be hard-pressed to justify another extension at the end of the current campaign. At 34, the former Ajax Cape Town midfielder is no spring-chicken and the fact that he has battled to fend off challenges from youngsters such as Njabulo Blom, says it all about his prospects going forward. BERNARD PARKER Like Katsande, he is not getting any younger. The 35-year-old attacker signed a one-year deal in January last year, which expires in June. Parker recently scored his first goal in two years and has been shunted around several attacking positions with little effect. His time at Amakhosi appears to be up. RAMAHLWE MPHAHLELE The part-time captain signed a new two-year deal with Amakhosi in March 2019 but has spent more time in sickbay than on the pitch since. But he has played 21 games so far this season across all competitions, owing to Huntâ€™s thin squad. Whether or not the 31-year-old has done enough to warrant a new deal remains to be seen. LEBOGANG MANYAMA Manyama has played as many as 27 games so far this season, though without standing out. He penned a three-year deal in August 2018, which ends in June. But he is likely to stay. KHAMA BILLIAT Unlike some, Billiat seems to have options and not fretting over his future. The Zimbabwe international joined Amakhosi from Mamelodi Sundowns in June 2018 on a three-year contract with an option of one further year. He has been linked with Zamalek. It will be a bit of a blow if he leaves, though not entirely a train smash for a team in need of rejuvenation, following years of underachievement.
