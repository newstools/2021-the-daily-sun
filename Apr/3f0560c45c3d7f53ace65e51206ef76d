Two brothers were shot and killed allegedly by a Bampoen farm owner in Piet Retief, Mpumalanga yesterday (09 April). Amos Coka and Zenzele Coka were amongst a group of people who went to engage with the famer about job opportunities since its harvesting season. It is alleged that the farm supervisors started arguing with their friend and later took him inside a store room were they allegedly assaulted him. The Coka brothers were shot while trying to save their friend. Farm Residence Workers and Labour Tenants Association leader, Bongani Hlatshwayo told Daily Sun thatÂ  last year they had a meeting with the farmer, to ask him to prioritise people living on the farm when there are job opportunities. "Today we went to the farm to ask him the same thing but we were attacked. It is painful because lives were lost in the process," he said. Last year June, the same farm owner allegedly poisoned cattle belonging to another family on the farm. Hlatshwayo said the community is angry and fears that a war may broke out. Mpumalanga police spokesman, Colonel Donald Mdluli confirmed that five people were arrested and charged with two counts of murder and one of attempted murder.
