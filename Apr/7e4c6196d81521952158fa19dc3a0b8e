NO South African can escape the impact of the fuel price increases, whether they own a car or use public transport. The fuel price makes a difference to every purchase a person in Mzansi makes, whether it is buying bread, food or a packet of cigarettes. And government has raised the price again. Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe, claims the increases are mainly because of the crude oil prices and the fuel levy increases. The average Brent crude oil price increased from R893 per barrel to R936 per barrel. The fuel levy and Road Accident Fund increases announced by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni in February kick in on Wednesday. The petrol and diesel levies increase by 16 cents and 11 cents a litre. He said the freight ship that got stuck sideways in the Suez Canal had a major influence on the price. “The rand depreciated on average against the US dollar from R14,76 to R14,95. Pipeline charges will increase by 1,2 cents per litre. “The bottom line for South Africans is that petrol prices will soar by up to 100 cents.” Regular petrol goes up 95 cents per litre and premium petrol R1 per litre. Diesel increase: 65,20 cents per litre and 63,20 cents per litre. Paraffin increase: 35 cents per litre. LP gas increase: 48 cents per litre.
