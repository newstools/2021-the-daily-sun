SWALLOWS FC just can’t seem to build any momentum in the second round of the DStv Premiership. The Dube Birds, who started like a house on fire, can barely string a run of two or more wins in a row of late. They were held to yet another draw, playing to a 1-1 draw with Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Molemela Stadium yesterday. Kgaogelo Sekgota was on the scoresheet for the Dube Birds while Neo Maema scored for Phunya Sele Sele. This was Swallows’ 13th draw of the season already and they remain the team with the most draws this campaign. They remain in fifth position on the Premiership table with 37 points from 22 matches. A win over Phunya Sele Sele would have seen Brandon Truter’s side leapfrog Orlando Pirates and Golden Arrows into third. However, they were forced to settle for a point and miss out on the opportunity to climb up the table. They headed into the match with plenty of optimism having snapped a ten-match winless run in the league with a 1-0 win at home over bottom-placed Black Leopards in their last match. But their opponents Celtic were equally determined to avoid defeat in their backyard where they are generally a tough nut to crack. The Mangaung outfit were hoping to improve on their last result, a 1-1 draw against Golden Arrows, as they continue their push for a top-eight finish. The result, though, saw them remain in 11th spot with 25 points from 23 matches. They are only a solitary point away from TS Galaxy who occupy the final top eight position. Swallows thought they would walk away with the win after Celtic keeper Sipho Chained handed Sekgota the opener on a silver platter with his error. But Maema equalized and salvaged a point for Celtic with a deflected shot. Celtic next face Stellenbosch FC at Danie Craven Stadium on Saturday (3pm) while Swallows host Pirates at Dobsonville Stadium on the same day (5pm).
