SAMORA Machel SAPS from Cape Town are appealing to the community to assist them with any information that can lead to the parents of a dumped child. Nomvuyo Madlolo, a 45-year-old woman from eYadini squatter camp, said it was around 3am when they heard a couple arguing. "I heard the lady calling a name, Olwethu, saying that she will leave the child there,” said Madlolo. She said they stopped fighting. "After few minutes we heard the child crying. At first we never thought that the mother left the baby in the street until the baby started crying," said Madlolo. Another resident said the baby was put inside a bag. "That woman is evil, I won't say much about the father because he never carried that baby, as for a woman who carried the child for  nine months she was stupid to dump her child like that," said the resident. “That woman needs to be locked in jail, she doesn't deserve that child, what if something happened to the child?" Zusiphe Mpindwana (34) said both parents needed to be arrested. "I don't care what were they fighting about, they should've never left the child, they both deserve to be locked up," said Mpindwana. She said parents need to stop taking harsh decisions regarding their kids when they are fighting. "We are living in a dangerous world where women and children are being abused, as parents, we should protect them not expose them. I am glad that the baby was found unharmed," said Mpindwana. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of child abandonment has been opened for investigation by Samora Machel after an unknown baby was found on the street by neighbours. “The parents of the child are unknown to SAPS at this stage, and we appeal to the community to assist the police with any information that can lead to the parents of the child.
