MOROKA Swallows boss David Mogashoa is concerned that the football industry is suffering as fans are still not allowed to watch their favourite teams in action at stadiums. Mogashoa raised an uproar on Twitter on Tuesday when he stressed that political parties are holding rallies regularly in a bid to garner support while football teams are not allowed to have a small percentage of the capacity at venues. The outspoken chairman is pleading with the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa to intervene and bring joy to Mzansi’s football fraternity. Said Mogashoa: “We are not allowed to have a smaller percentage of supporters at the stadiums, but they (political parties) are holding rallies. The minister needs to resolve this matter urgently because the industry is suffering.” Added Mogashoa: “Otla bona wena (you will see) this is just the beginning. You will see them (political parties) filling up the very stadiums they are saying we can’t have supporters (at).” His sentiments were echoed by Tweeps who are also calling for fans throughout Mzansi to boycott voting for the upcoming Municipal elections until the matter is resolved. “We must discuss this issue and call on all football fans and say NO Stadium NO vote,” said one Tweep. Added another Tweep: “I think they are being selfish now. In fact, stadiums are much safer and there is plenty of space for social distancing. In any case, our teams hardly fill the stadiums to capacity unless in a few selected games.”
