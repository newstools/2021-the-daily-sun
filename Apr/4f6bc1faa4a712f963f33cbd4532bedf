IFP has called for the postponement of the upcoming local government elections until May next year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The party believes the brief postponement will provide enough opportunity for all parties involved to make the necessary preparations. Municipal councils’ five-year term ends on 4 August and the Constitution states that elections must be held within 90 days, which means by 1 November. Although the party has called for a brief postponement, it doesn’t support the extended postponement or the proposed combination of the local government elections, provincial and the national election until 2024 as has been suggested by other parties. IFP spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa told Daily Sun that the roles and functions of these three spheres of government are vastly different, and it will also dilute campaigning. “The shorter postponement until May 2022 will ensure that no amendment to the Constitution is required, rather just a resolution, in light of the unprecedented circumstances created due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By postponing the local government elections until May 2022, there will also be a much-needed opportunity for the people of South Africa to attain herd immunity, where more than 60% of the population has been vaccinated,” he said. IFP believes this milestone will not be possible by November this year, as the current vaccination drive has been very slow, with barely 250 000 of the healthcare professionals vaccinated to date. “Postponing until May 2022 will allow additional, safe, opportunities for campaigning, as well as for a more extensive Voter Registration drive.
