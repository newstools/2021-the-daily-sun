CONGRESS of South African Students (Cosas) and ANC Youth League activists picketed outside the offices of Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga in Tshwane yesterday. They demanded mental health intervention at schools, with emphasis on those in rural areas. The picket came after the death of pupil Lufuno Mavhunga in Limpopo last week. The organisations said her suicide highlighted Motshekga’s neglect of the psychosocial well-being of pupils. They also accused her of refusing to take responsibility for the bullying incident that led to Lufuno’s death, by saying it happened outside the school. They claimed she turned her back on the matter while she was in the province, and even failed to visit the school and bereaved family. The picketers delivered a memorandum of demands. Among other things, they demanded permanent social workers and psychologists as part of schooling staff, and proactive programmes at schools to educate about bullying. ANCYL activist Lindokuhle Xulu said their demand for social workers and psychologists at schools was to attend to the mental and psychological problems children dealt with. Cosas’ Musa Shabangu said they called on government to employ people who would work with pupils’ mental health. He said teachers could not be forced to switch roles. “A teacher cannot play the role of a social worker. We are also calling on the Department of Treasury to make funds available for people who will be helping in schools.” He said what happened to Lufuno should serve as a wake-up call to government. “What happened is terrible. One life has been lost and another one has been destroyed. We cannot let such continue to happen. Action needs to be taken, especially in rural schools.”
