IT’S not every day you see an R8 million Italian sport car going for a swim. The brand-new Ferrari 812 GTS has likely been destroyed after rolling into a lake in Italy. Local media reported the Italian supercar was parked along the Via Achille Grandi roadway in the commune of Sirmione, Brescia, in the north of the country. According to Formula Passion, the car was carelessly left in neutral on a slight decline without the handbrake on. Apparently, it’s not as simple as most cars to leave the car without its handbrakes on. Online car magazine, The Drive, said it’s not simple to leave an 812 in neutral without putting up the hand brake. The driver needs to pull both paddle shifters to engage neutral but after letting off the brake, the car will automatically engage the “park lock” to prevent it from moving. If a driver wants to leave the car in neutral without the handbrake engaged, they need to activate “carwash mode” that involves engaging neutral, switching off the car, and turning on accessory mode within three seconds. This mode requires the manual engagement of the parking brake and doesn’t apply it automatically. It’s unclear if the owner of this 812 GTS had the car in its carwash mode at the time or if they accidentally disengaged the handbrake.
