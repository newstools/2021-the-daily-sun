We need to educate boys what consent means in relationships. Sexual violence is a problem in adolescent dating relationships, in part because teens are neither clear on what consent means nor how to ask for it. If we can teach our kids about consent and show them how to practise it through our actions, through those little teaching moments maybe the horror stories could be less common. By giving kids choices in expressing consent about how they’d like to be touched, we teach them how to express it when we’re not around. When kissing a kid goodnight say: “May I give you a kiss goodnight?” And respect their answer. Teaching kids about consent can help reduce sexual coercion, harassment and even assault.
