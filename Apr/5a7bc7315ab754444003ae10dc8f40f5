PRETORIA Callies coach Joel Masutha has confirmed that Black Leopards have offered a coaching job following the resignation of Kosta Papic at the club. SunSport reported on Wednesday morning that Papic had parted ways with Lidoda Duvha after spending mere two months at the club. Papic had penned a two-year contract with the Venda-based side as their technical manager, working with interim coach Lehlohonolo Seema. But his stint has been cut short. Seema, who has been in the hotseat confirmed Leopards have made contact with him. However, he cannot go back there as he has an ambition is to promote Callies. Masutha said: “Yes, we spoke, but they found out that I am with Callies now. “I have ambitions to take this team to the DStv Premiership, so obviously I can’t be in two places at the same time. My heart is with Callies. I wish Leopards all the best in their remaining games so they can survive relegation.” He added: “You must know and understand that Black Leopards has been my home for more than 16 years as a player and as coach. There will always be that strong bond between myself and the club. I always wish them luck and want to see them doing well.” Masutha joined the Romans early this month after Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila fired him in February. The well-traveled Masutha replaced Sammy Troughton, who is now coaching Cape Town All-Stars in the GladAfrica Championship. On Saturday, Masutha will be hoping to lead the Romans to the historic Nedbank Cup final when they face Chippa United in the semifinal of the competition at Lucas Moripe Stadium(3pm).
