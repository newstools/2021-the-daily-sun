RESIDENTS and several civic organisations took to the streets to demand justice for a gay man who was raped and killed in Nyanga last weekend. A group of more than 150 people marched in the streets of Nyanga. They gathered at the scene where Lonwabo Jack’s body was found and prayed before they went back to their homes. Kasi organisations that advocate for the rights of vulnerable groups Ilitha Labantu led the march calling for the government to protect gay people. Spokesman Siyabulela Monakali said they were shocked by the gruesome murder of the 22-year-old gay man. “This is horrific, we want justice for Lonwabo. The killing of the LGBTQI people must come to an end. We are out here calling for justice. Today it is Lonwabo and tomorrow it will be someone else,” said Siyabulela.  Lonwabo went out to celebrate his birthday on Friday, 16 April and it was the last time his family saw him alive. They were only called on Sunday morning, 18 April after he was found raped and killed at a house in Pula Street in Mau Mau area, Nyanga. The house is next door to the house of his friend who hosted his birthday party. Linda Siwela Ntlang, the founder of Triangle Project, a group that advocates for the rights of the LGBTQI community, said being gay is not a crime. He said he was also a victim of rape and called for the government to take measures to protect them. “They raped him and do what they wanted, why then did they kill him,” he said.  Sanco leader in Nyanga Nobeka Ngxukuma said the LGBTQI community lived in fear in the kasi. “They are people like everyone else and whom they decide to be in love with does not take away their humanity. Killing people because they love one another is barbaric,” she said. Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said cops were investigating a murder case.
