A Durban
woman who was shot in the head were among those killed in a shooting over the
weekend in Ndlovu in the Lamontville area, police said. Police
spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker on Monday said four men aged between 23 and
24 were among those arrested after police worked "around the clock"
to nab the alleged perpetrators. Naicker
said that on Saturday night, Lamontville police officers responded to a
shooting incident on Ndlovu Road. "According
to reports received by police officers on the scene, the gunmen had opened fire
on a vehicle that was parked in the road. Two of the occupants were killed
instantly whilst a third was seriously injured. "The
body of a woman with gunshot wounds to the head was found in the bushes
adjacent to where the shooting had occurred. Lamontville police officers opened
a case of murder and attempted murder for investigation." Naicker
added that Lamontville police worked through the night and traced the suspects
allegedly behind the shooting to a house in the area. "The
suspects were found in possession of three firearms and eleven rounds of
ammunition. Police also seized rock cocaine, a flat screen TV as well as a
vehicle that were found on the premises." The
suspects are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Tuesday on
charges of murder, attempted murder, possession of drugs as well as the unlawful
possession of firearms and ammunition. KZN top cop
Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi commended the officers, saying their
swift work led to the arrests. "They
continued to work throughout the night following up on leads received from the
community. We also wish to thank members of the community who came forward to
assist police to identify the perpetrators." SOURCE:
