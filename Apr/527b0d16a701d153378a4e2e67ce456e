Organisers of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics on Wednesday announced tougher coronavirus countermeasures such as daily testing of athletes to try to reassure an increasingly sceptical Japanese public already facing a resurgence of Covid-19. With under three months to go before the postponed Games, Japan's vaccination drive lags other wealthy nations, raising safety concerns among citizens and athletes, and complicating the future for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has repeatedly vowed the Games will go ahead. The organisers, including the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Japanese government and the International Paralympic Committee, said in a joint statement that they would "deploy all possible countermeasures and place the highest priority on safety". Overseas spectators have already been ruled out and a decision on whether to allow domestic spectators will be taken in June, a few weeks before the Games begin on 23 July. Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said that while organisers wanted as many spectators as possible, they were ready to take every step needed to ensure safety. "We are prepared to hold the Games without spectators," she told a news conference following a meeting on the second draft of rule "playbooks" for the Olympics and Paralympics. Athletes and close contacts will be tested every day, while all participants must have two negative tests before arrival. Participants will not be allowed to use public transport and must eat in specific locations with special hygiene measures. -RAPPORT
