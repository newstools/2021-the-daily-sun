MEMBERS of the Free Gender Organisation recently marched to Harare Police Station in Khayelitsha to hand over a memorandum. Member Sinethemba Goba said lesbians were being raped every day. “We’re here to tell you to take rape cases seriously. We’ve been asking for this for a long time,” she said. Goba said cops often preach and encourage women to open rape cases, but when they do they’re not taken seriously. “Cops are not doing their part. We report these cases and the perpetrators get arrested. But they never even go to court because cops say there is not enough evidence,” she said. Goba said perpetrators have more rights than victims. “A lot of women never report cases because they know nothing will happen to the suspects. We want updates when cases are open. Follow up so these perpetrators can learn their lesson,” she said. Organisation chairwoman, Lwethu Kala, said police are failing to do their job. One of the complaints in the memorandum was how Harare cops failed to keep a rape suspect last year. “In August 2020, a lesbian was raped at Endlovini. The rapist was caught by the community and handed over to Harare cops. But later he was released without any contact with the victim,” said Kala. Some of the demands included cops giving full information to survivors when they open cases, picking them up in the evening after medical checks to avoid sleeping at Thuthuzela waiting for detectives, and investigators meeting survivors at the police station where the case was opened or survivors being picked up to avoid waiting for long. “We’re giving them seven days to respond. We’re victims because perpetrators know they’re going to walk free. That’s why these cases increase every day,” said Kala. Sergeant Nosiphiwo Mntengwana said their job was to transport the victims to Thuthuzela. “We didn’t know they waited too long as we ask detectives dealing with rape cases to take over. But we will investigate,” said Mntengwana.
