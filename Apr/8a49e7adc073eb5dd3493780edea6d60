Many service delivery protests are a reflection that our government has failed us in so many ways. We’re sick and tired of politicians’ empty promises made every election year. These so-called political leaders have made fools of us for a long time, and this must stop. As a nation, we should ensure that we vote for political parties whose leaders will address all our needs. Politicians should learn to keep their promises and live by example. Andries Kabini Rockville, Soweto
