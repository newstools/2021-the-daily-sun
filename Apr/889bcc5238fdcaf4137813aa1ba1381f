MAMELODI Sundowns co-coach Rhulani Mokwena is not reading too much into Kaizer Chiefs' position in the league and their midweek result ahead of Sunday's blockbuster. The log leaders host struggling Amakhosi at Loftus Stadium, 3pm. Sundowns, who defeated Chiefs 3-0 in the first round, will be looking at extending the to eight points at the top, while Chiefs would be hoping to revive their top-eight finish hopes. After 22 matches, Chiefs are 11th on the log with 25 points. This is their first time struggling for the better half of the season. And with eight games remaining, they would want to restore some pride. Mokwena said they would have to be sober-minded. "But the reality is that because it is Kaizer Chiefs, you have to be very sober-minded when you do your analysis and not derive anything from their log position and their unfortunate result against Cape Town City," Mokwena said. "They are a big team, we have a lot of respect for them. They are with a very good coach in Gavin Hunt he is experienced and he knows what he is doing. He is someone I have great admiration and huge respect for." Chiefs are going to this match limping after their eight-game unbeaten run in all competition was broken by Cape Town City on Wednesday. On the other hand, Sundowns go into this match after failing to win in their last two games. They were knocked out of the Nedbank Cup by Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and a 0-0 draw against AmaZulu on Wednesday.
