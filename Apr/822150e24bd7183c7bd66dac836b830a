ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer remains uncertain on when Thembinkosi Lorch will return from injury. The attacking midfielder made 14 league appearances this season before limping off injured in their Nedbank Cup clash against Maritzburg United. He had been expected to resume training early last month, but so far he has been conspicuous by his absence. Zinnbauer, however, has explained the 27-year-old was working his way back. Zinnbauer said: "We know we need him and I know that he is working with the medical staff. But I cannot say that he is ready for tomorrow or maybe for Saturday. "I don't know. We hope to have him back soon." Pirates host ES Setif in a Caf Confederation group match at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday at 3pm. Pirates are heading to the match needing maximum points to qualify for the next round of the tournament. In the first leg played in Accra, Ghana, the two sides played to a goalless draw. Zinnbauer said they are hoping to play better this time around as they will be playing on a smooth surface. "In the away game we did have a few problems with this grass. We hope we will play better, three points is the target," he said. "We have seen the clips of Setif's other gamesâ€š playing on normal surfaces. And they played better than in the first leg." Pirates lead Group A with eight points from two draws and two wins while their opponents are languishing at the bottom of the group with four points.
