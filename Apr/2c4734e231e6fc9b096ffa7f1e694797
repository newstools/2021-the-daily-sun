THE community of Marikana near Rustenburg, North West marched to Marikana Police Station on Tuesday, 13 April. The angry residents want the station to remove corrupt cops. The residents claim that the cops are working with local mines against the community. A memorandum of demands was submitted. Community leader Raserola Mashamaite (31) said the station was consistent in denying to give protests permits when mines are involved. He said they will not stand to be divided by people who should be protecting the community. “The Marikana Police Station is working with mines to divide the community.” He said the community wished for the previous station commander to be brought back as under her leadership the community of Marikana was in a better state. “We requested that we should get feedback on our demand in four days. The community made it clear that there will be a violent protest should our demands be ignored.” Marikana station commander Captain Sello None accepted and signed the memorandum. He said they heard the community’s demands. “I will take it upon myself to submit them to the relevant departments. We will therefore come back with feedback within the given time,” said None.
