HE was sent to buy bread at a local spaza shop. But two thugs took the R100 he was supposed to use at the shop. On Monday, the Nigel Regional Court sentenced Godfrey Nhlapo (20) and Tumi Tsotetsi (19) to 15 years each for aggravated robbery. Police spokesman Sergeant Harry Manaka said the robbery happened on 3 July last year. “They robbed a 14-year-old from Bluegum View, Duduza while he was on his way to buy bread. He was with his three friends. “One of the suspects choked the boy from behind, while the other one threatened the boy’s friends with a knife,” said Manaka. Duduza cops reacted swiftly after the incident was reported and managed to trace and arrest the suspects. Detective Sergeant Veron Mofokeng investigated the matter and presented evidence before court. The boys’ families welcomed the sentencing. “The incident traumatised our kids. We hope the suspects learn their lesson,” said a relative of one of the boys.
