BEFORE Palesa Kibe (31) got into the taxi on Tuesday morning, she shared a big hug with her mum, Selina Kibe (71). Little did she know it was the last time she would share a hug with her. When Palesa from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, came back from work she went to her outside room to find that the room had been ransacked and her laptop, shoes and R2 000 in cash were missing. “I ran into the house to check on my mum,” Palesa said. The house had been ransacked too. “It looked as if the thugs were having the time of their lives and had time to search for valuables. I hoped my mum had managed to flee,” she said. But that was not to be.  When Palesa went to the bedroom, she saw Selina lying on the floor. She had clothes wrapped around her head with which the thugs had suffocated her. She didn’t respond when Palesa called her name. She called the police and the ambulance but her mum was certified dead at the scene. Cops are still looking for the suspects, who left with her plasma TV and laptop. Palesa said her mum was her friend and pillar of strength. “I lost my job at the start of the lockdown and she was always there for me. I recently found a new job. I was planning to do great things for her but her life was cut short.” Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha of Rabasotho Police Station in Tembisa said a murder case was opened and cops are looking for the suspects.
