IZINYOKA are warned of the known dangers of stealing and vandalising electricity infrastructure. This after an unknown man lost his life in Roodepoort, west of Joburg on Wednesday night. According to City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena, the unknown man was found by City Power technicians when responding to an outage after the Pennyville distributor tripped at about 10pm. “Upon investigation, the technicians found the person died after being electrocuted. “It’s believed the victim was killed when he tried to steal the cable. He was lying near an 11Kv pylon with a cable feeding the overhead line cut. His tools were also near him,” said Mangena. He said paramedics and the police attended to the scene. “Cable theft is a serious problem for City Power, not only because it inconveniences our customers, but also because we lose millions in revenue,” said City Power CEO Mongezi Ntsokolo. Mangena said some sections of Fleurhof were still off because of this incident, and a team has been sent to replace the cable. “We apologise to the affected residents, and will update on the progress of the repairs. The CEO and management of City Power have extended their condolences to the family of the deceased,” said Mangena.
