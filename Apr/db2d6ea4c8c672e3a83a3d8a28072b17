AT LEAST three women were killed after a bakkie they were travelling in overturned on the R40 at about 8am on Saturday, 3 April. Mpumalanga Community Safety, Security and Liaison MEC Vusi Shongwe has urged motorists to obey the rules of the road and drive cautiously after three women were killed in a crash. Shongwe said the crash occurred when a light delivery vehicle overturned on R40 Road between Hazyview and Marite.  “Fourteen more people sustained serious injuries and were rushed to Matikwane and Tintswalo hospitals respectively. Two people were declared dead at the scene while the third person died in hospital. The cause of the crash is still being investigated but indications show that the driver may have lost control before the vehicle overturned. It is also believed that the people in the bakkie were part of a funeral procession from one of the farming towns,” said Shongwe. He said with increased caution, driving tragedies such as this are avoidable. The MEC sent his condolences to the bereaved families and wished those who were injured a speedy recovery.
