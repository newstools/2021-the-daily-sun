Today we remember Jean-Yves Kerjean, the former Orlando Pirates and Black Leopards coach. The Frenchman first came to Pirates in 2001 and introduced his youthful squad, which he guided to third-place in the league and a 3â€“0 thumping of Kaizer Chiefs in the Soweto Derby. But he was fired the following year. That was the longest of his stays in South Africa after being axed by Black Leopards within a month in 2005, but later on cited safety of his family. "We always had to be escorted by bodyguards," he said in 2005. But ahead of the 2010 Fifa World Cup, Kerjean, now 68, applied for the coaching job but his CV wasn't even considered by Safa.
