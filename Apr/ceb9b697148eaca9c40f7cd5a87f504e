IT’S worrying that sometimes our justice system seems biased as it’s not equally applied. Most of the time it punishes the poor while it lets the rich off the hook. Are these laws meant to only punish poor people? It’s shocking and unfair for our judicial system to leave rich people to go without being punished, even though they have committed terrible crimes. Our Constitution states clearly that there’s no one who’s above the law as. Our judicial system should ensure rich people also pay for their crimes in the same way they punish the poor. Rockville
