A POLICE officer is in hospital after allegedly being attacked by the owner of a tavern and his patrons. Sergeant Thapelo Mofokeng stationed at the Kroonstad, Free State police station and a colleague attended to a complaint at a well-known tavern, where a black man was allegedly assaulted by the white tavern owner and others. Allegedly, the arrested suspect is a son of former police officer, while the main culprit fled the scene in a bakkie. Mofokeng told Daily Sun they met the victim at the tavern, who told them he was assaulted by the tavern owner and other white men. “They took his R400, his jersey and BlackBerry cellphone. “The tavern owner insulted the man saying f**k three times,” said the cop. “I said you cannot behave like this in front of the police. He smashed me with his head.” Mofokeng said his two cellphones were broken and he was kicked. Allegedly, his colleague heard one of the perpetrators saying “k****r policeman”. Mofokeng said he intended reporting the matter to the Human Rights Commission.  His colleague, Sergeant Jonas Mokoena said because of Mzansi’s laws they did nothing. “Police are dying every day. We need justice,” said Mokoena. South African Police Union Free State provincial Secretary Morui Mphou condemned what he called unsocial behaviour against law enforcers. “Police officials have limited rights. This is the right time to educate South African communities to respect our officers. One suspect was arrested at the scene after cops called for backup. The main culprit was arrested a few days later. The first suspect appeared in the Kroonstad Magistrates Court on 5 April and second suspect appeared on 15 April.
