SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo has accused other clubs of tapping his players. Tembo said this was the reason they couldn’t perform to their best and were thrashed 3-0 by Cape Town City in a DStv Premiership match at Cape Town Stadium this past Saturday. Sipho Mbule, who is said to be heading to Mamelodi Sundowns, started the match on the bench. Even when he came on for Jamie Webber in the 55th minute, he didn’t look like a player who was eager to influence the game. Jesse Don, starting his first game this season ahead of Mbule, was taken off in the 71st minute and was replaced by Moses Waiswa Ndhondhi. “You can see there’s a lot of disorganisation that has crept in the team because there’s a lot of things happening behind the scenes, where players are being tapped and players are looking to move,” said Tembo, who was in charge of his 100th game for SuperSport. “That always destabilises the team, but we’ll try and make sure that players refocus and stay professional until the end of the season.” Tembo’s side appear unsettled and have not won any of their last six league matches. Tembo’s outburst doesn’t come as a surprise. Mbule’s teammate, Teboho Mokoena revealed, during the recent SA Under-23 camp in Durban, that this might be his last season with the club. Mbule has been linked with Sundowns, who have been accused of tapping their Tshwane rivals players. United finally allowed Aubrey Modiba to join Downs last season. And it looks like Mbule and Mokoena could be heading in the same direction in the off season.
