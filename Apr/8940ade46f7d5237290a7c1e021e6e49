  Self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri’s daughter’s will be laid to rest this afternoon Thursday. Her remains were repatriated from Kenya to Malawi on Wednesday. According to the report, Isrealla (8), died in the early hours of Monday morning after being hospitalised for three weeks. Last week Bushiri revealed that his daughter was unable to breathe on her own and she was in ICU. Bushiri said on Tuesday her burial will take place at Ntcheu Boma in Malawi. After her body was repatriated, Bushiri penned down a heartwarming letter to his daughter on his Facebook page. He said: "Dear Israella whilst your mother and I are welcoming you back home from where you made your last breath, my heart I pour out to you.  "We're told over and over, that the Lord gives, and he takes away, until we almost expect to be left empty-handed."  He further wrote: "That every dark room is an opportunity, for even the smallest of lights to shine bright." He concluded by saying: “Sweet Israella, Princess of God, though we cannot touch you anymore, your light will lead us safely home. We love, honour and celebrate you, now and forever."
