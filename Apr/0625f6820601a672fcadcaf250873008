THE two Coka brothers who were murdered at Pampoenkraal farm on 9 April have been laid to rest in their homestead in Mkhondo, Mpumalanga on Saturday, 17 April. Amos (36) and Zenzele Coka (40) were shot and killed allegedly by farmers. It was reported that they were among a group of people who were trying to rescue a friend who was kidnapped and assaulted allegedly by the farmers. Family, friends, residents and members of different organisations came out in their numbers to bid farewell to the brothers. An emotional Bongane Nkosi, who was representing Abazingeli described Zenzele as a funny person, who had a fighting spirit. He told the mourners that his passing still felt so surreal. Meanwhile, his nephew Sandile Zondo said the farmers took away two valuable family members.  He said they took care of his grandmother and other family members, adding that they were always available to help without complaining. Sandile said the farmers should leave Pampoenkraal and let its rightful owners occupy it. He said they were tired of human rights abuses perpetuated by the farmers. Meanwhile, there was heavy police presence in the area. The funeral service was also attended by Mpumalanga Community Safety MEC Vusi Shongwe. He called for calm in the community and said pointing fingers would not help the family. He cautioned community leaders and political formations to refrain from making statements that may compromise the investigation into the murder of the Coka brother that is already underway. He further said the community should continue to support the family until justice was served.
