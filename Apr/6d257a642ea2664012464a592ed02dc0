FORMER President Jacob Zuma says he doesn’t legitimise "the sham" that he calls the contempt of court charges against him. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng had directed Zuma to file an affidavit of no longer than 15 pages by Wednesday, 14 April, stating what constituted the appropriate sanction. In a 21-page letter to Mogoeng, Zuma said: “I have thought long and hard about the request in your directives. I have also been advised that addressing a letter of this nature to the court is unprecedented as a response to a directive to file an affidavit.” He also wished to advise he would not depose an affidavit as presently directed, and it was not out of any disrespect for Mogoeng or the court. “My position, in respect of the contempt of court proceedings, is a conscientious objection to what I consider to be an extraordinary abuse of judicial authority to advance politically charged narratives of politically but very powerful commercial, and political interests through the Zondo Commission. My objection is legitimate, as it is sourced directly from the Constitution itself and what it promises,” the letter said. The former president said that the Chief Justice’s directive provided that he must answer the questions in a 15-page affidavit within three days. “Regrettably, if I accede to your request, I purge my conscientious objection for having not participated in the proceedings of the Constitutional Court. So, please accept this letter as the only manner in terms of which I am able to convey my conscientious objection to the manner in which your Constitutional Court justices have abused their power to take away rights accorded to me, by the Constitution. “I invite you to share this letter with them as it is relevant to the directions that you have issued. I make this request having been advised that this letter is not a pleading.”
