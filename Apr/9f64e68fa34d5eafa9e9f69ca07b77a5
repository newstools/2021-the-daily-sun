AWARD-WINNING radio DJ Jacinta Ngobese has opened up about abuse. She revealed that she was cheated on and beaten in her previous relationship. She said she had hoped things would change, but they didn’t. She revealed this on her Facebook page, where she said she was glad she left that relationship and realised there were better men out there. Jacinta, who works for Vuma FM, opened up about the abuse after she shared a Facebook posting by Fanele Sphokuhle Mncwango that said: “Omunye bayamcheatela...bese bexolisa ngokumposta bemenza ididi. (Someone is cheated on and the cheater apologises by posting them, making them stupid).” ALSO READ: ZODWA TAKES HER EGG BUSINESS TO EKASI She then said: “That was me, I was happy and thinking it was a sign he was going to stop. I’m grateful I came out of that relationship and realised there were still good men like someone...” Jacinta said all of the abuse took place while she was wearing a ring. She said she didn’t know where the ring disappeared to, adding that maybe her ancestors took it out and threw it away. Kini Shandu who was Jacinta’s colleague on Gagasi FM commented: “You were indeed stupid but you must thank me.” Jacinta said she is laughing about it now because she managed to come out of the abusive relationship. "It's all in the past. I'm glad that I'm happy where I am," said Jacinta
