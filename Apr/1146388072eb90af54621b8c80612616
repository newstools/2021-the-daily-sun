FOOTBALL players don't always take kindly to being substituted. The petulant would be seen snubbing the coach’s handshake and sullenly rushing to the bench. Others completely lose their marbles... as was the case with Gora Ebrahim 26 years ago. Ebrahim broke the ribs of then Rabali Blackpool coach Walter "Mr Fitness" Rautmann with a flying kick into his chest, enraged after being yanked off.  That moment of madness practically ended the career of the ex-Orlando Pirates and Dynamos defender. As Ebrahim said years later; it's a moment he will regret as long as he lives. “I lost my cool when Walter replaced me and I kicked him. Whatever happened there happened in the heat of the moment,” said Ebrahim, who went on to become a teacher. “I have apologised to Walter and everybody affected. If I could replay that day I would hope that things turn out differently. “I was not even 29 years old at the time. It was very embarrassing and out of character. I was the captain of the team and guys looked up to me. As a professional, it shouldn't have happened. As a result of a rush of blood to the head, I have paid the highest price. I paid with my career. "But I have moved on from the unfortunate incident. I have learned from it."
