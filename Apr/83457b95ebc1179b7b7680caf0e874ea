AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy says Thabo Qalinge will play a key role for Usuthu as the DStv Premiership season edges towards the end. Qalinge (29) was signed by Usuthu as a free agent a few days ago after he impressed McCarthy during almost a three-week assessment. The former Orlando Pirates winger started on the bench, replacing Luvuyo Memela in the 70th minute when AmaZulu beat Black Leopards 1-0 at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday. The win saw Usuthu move to third on the table with 37 points after 21 games, level on points with neighbours Golden Arrows and one behind log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, who have three games in hand. Based on what McCarthy saw in the winger during the 20 minutes he featured, the former Bafana Bafana striker said Qalinge impressed him. “He’s only going to get better and better at training. So, it was a matter of time as to when we’ll look to slot him in. Hopefully, he can add the quality we have seen of him at training.” Qalinge’s last game in the PSL was last January for SuperSport United when they lost to Mamelodi Sundowns. But the Tshwane giants decided to part ways with him, just after last season was suspended due to Covid-19. “I think he has done well. It’s his first game. He hasn’t played in a while,” added McCarthy. “So, we have to take it step-by-step and get him back in the groove.” AmaZulu made club history by winning five league games on the bounce. Usuthu also became the first side this season to win five league matches on the trot. They have also kept clean sheets in those matches. They next play Stellenbosch FC at Danie Craven Stadium on Friday (5pm). McCarthy’s side will regroup and sort out a few areas of concern. “Now, we have a couple of days to work on a few tactical aspects of our game,” revealed McCarthy.
