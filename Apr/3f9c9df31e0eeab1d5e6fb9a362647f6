IT appears there might be bad blood between Mthandeni “Igcokama Elisha” Manqele and his former dancer, Nkanyiso “Polo” Makhoba. This after Polo left Mthandeni’s band after eight years. He went on to start a solo project, but received backlash from maskandi fans. From Eshowe in KZN, Polo accused Mthandeni of being bitter over his project and bad-mouthing him to fans. He told Daily Sun he was hurt Mthandeni was on a mission to portray him as a back-stabber. “The bad blood between us started after he created the band Omacekeceke in 2019. “I composed and led three songs on its album. Many people were impressed by my singing talent,” he said. He said he was approached by other music promoters to push him as a solo artist, and this is when Mthandeni got bitter. “Mthandeni started to bad-mouth me to other members. He asked me to join his rival Khuzani Mpungose’s band to spy on him, and I refused,” he said. Last year, Polo released two singles Ngangigxoba Ababhemu and Amathemba. He is set to release his debut album in June. He said Mthandeni lied to fans that he paid lobola for him. “I paid lobola for my wife years ago when I still lived in KwaMashu Hostel. When living in Mzimhlophe Hostel in Joburg, a man from my village presented me with money, which is the custom in our village when someone is about to get married. I invited Mthandeni and the band, but they only arrived with alcohol for themselves. He is now lying, saying he gave me money.” Polo said some people damaged Mthandeni’s car tyre and fans accused him of that. But Mthandeni said he had not seen Polo in a long time. “I last saw him when I was critically ill. He used to visit but disappeared when I got ill. According to my knowledge, he is still my dancer.”
