THE office of the Public Protector announced Thandi Sibanyoni as the new CEO. Briefing the media in Cape Town yesterday, acting Public Protector Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka said Sibanyoni brought a wealth of public service experience, which extended over a period of 30 years, 20 of which were in senior management. Gcaleka also released several investigation reports from the fourth quarter of the 2020/21 financial year. Some of the reports included an investigation which found that the Eastern Cape medical scooters were improperly procured. “We found that the procurement process was improper and in contravention of applicable legal prescripts,” Gcaleka said. She said to remedy this maladministration and improper conduct, the acting head of department should take appropriate steps against the responsible officials within 90 days from the date of the report. Gcaleka said they also investigated allegations of a breach of the Executive Ethics Code by Western Cape Transport and Public Works MEC, Bonginkosi Madikizela. She said the probe followed a November 2019 complaint by Brett Herron, a member of Legislature. “Mr Herron alleged that Madikizela wilfully made false and misleading statements to the Legislature about him on 23 July 2019 and that the conduct in question was improper and constituted a breach of the Executive Ethics Code. “We found that Madikizela wilfully made false and misleading statements about Mr Herron,” she said. She praised their investigators, saying they wouldn’t have been able to release these reports without their outstanding dedication. “I wish to thank and congratulate the staff for going the extra mile to finalise approximately 6 700 of about 8 600 cases as at 28 February under stringent conditions, not only brought about by limited resources, but exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said.
