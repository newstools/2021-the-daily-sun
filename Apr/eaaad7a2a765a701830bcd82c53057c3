LOUD drums, izangoma singing, chanting and ululating were the order of the day as Vuyelwa “Uzanemvula” Ngemntu performed her traditional routines. Vuyelwa’s friends, family and colleagues gathered in Miami Sands, Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal to witness her home coming. The three-day long graduation festivities saw abakhaphi singing for Ngemntu while her gobela monitored the showcasing of what she’d learnt during her spiritual journey. Gobela Chippo “Nyoka Tapera Insizwa ka mlambo” Mpofu said Ngemntu, who’s a teacher, came to her indumba in Evaton earlier last year, pretending to consult. “Her intentions was for me to be her gobela as her dreams had led her to me. We undertook her spiritual journey and we worked together to make sure her gift is achieved. Ngemntu is a very strong thwasa and her powerful ancestors were always there,” said Mpofu. He said she helped Ngemntu with ubundawu, ubunguni, isonto lasephiri and bringing her closer to her ancestors. ALSO READ: MAKHOSI IN HER OWN CLASS! “We’re happy with the progress she made.
