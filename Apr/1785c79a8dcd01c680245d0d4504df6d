A SECOND murder charge has now been added against Lucky Mbuzi (42), a ward councillor at the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Local Municipality. Mbuzi is charged for the murder of yet another ANC activist. Suspects Mbuzi, Luthando Manyana (23) and Simbongile Mjuleka (28) appeared in the Bizana Magistrates Court last week. They were charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, as well as illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. According to NPA spokesman Luxolo Tyali, the trio allegedly killed Mduduzi Madikizela (46) at his home in Jali Village two weeks ago. Mbuzi is a councillor in Madikizelaâ€™s ward. Their case was remanded to Wednesday for a formal bail application. Tyali said when the accused appeared in court on Wednesday, more charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, as well as unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition were added against Mbuzi and Mjuleka. The charges relate to the murder of ANC activist Hleliphi Thotshe (50) on 10 March, also from Jali. Charges against Siphelele Cele and Mziwokuthula Ntaka, who were initially charged with Mbuzi, were withdrawn. Madikizela died in a hail of bullets at his Ntshamathe Village home in Bizana in what is believed to be a political hit. According to police, Madikizela was outside his home when gunmen started firing at him. He died on his way to hospital. The four were arrested within three days of the murder. Last week, ANC national spokesman Pule Mabe condemned the killing.
