TRADITIONAL prime minister of the Zulu nation, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has asked Mzansi to stop speculating about the new Zulu king. He said this had the potential to create conflict. “Since the passing of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, the royal family has kept the nation informed every step of the way on matters related to the king’s succession,” said Buthelezi. He said despite this there was a continued stream of speculation through the media by academics and experts on what might happen in the royal family. “This has the capacity, wittingly or unwittingly, to create conflict and disquiet. The royal family therefore asks again to be given the space to mourn,” he said. Buthelezi appealed for respect for the king and his grieving family and asked those with opinions on the matter of succession to stop stirring up speculation. Zwelithini died last month of illnesses related to Covid-19 and was planted in a private ceremony attended only by close male relatives last month. He was the longest-reigning Zulu king, having sat on the throne for almost 50 years. “The nation may rest assured the family is dealing with all necessary matters and will take them to finality. “It’s preferable, however, that this process be accomplished without the unnecessary distress of misleading conjectures.” Queen Mantfombi Dlamini has been made regent of the Zulu nation. Her appointment was announced following a meeting between Zwelithini’s lawyers and members of the royal family to discuss his will. The king had six wives and 26 kids at the time of his death last month.
