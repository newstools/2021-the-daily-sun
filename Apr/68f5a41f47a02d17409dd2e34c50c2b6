IF football did not work out for Daine Klate, he still would have been a star but at a different sport. The legendary Premier Soccer League (PSL) player would have made a fine cricketer if football did not steal his heart. It turns out the Gqeberha-born star is just as good with the cricket ball and bat as he is with his feet. At school and district level, Klate was a fast bowler and a capable batsman. But at the age of 14 he decided football was his calling and he left his home town to join a Safa school of Excellence development program. After a successful football career, Klate still takes some time to play another sport he loves dearly, cricket. See Pics below:
