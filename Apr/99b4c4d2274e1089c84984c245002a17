RELEGATION-threatened Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) received a big boost ahead of their crucial DStv Premiership clash against high flying Mamelodi Sundowns at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday (3pm). Tshakhuma are set to welcome back their star defender Alfred Ndengane, who missed their 2-0 defeat against AmaZulu in a league clash two weeks ago after he and striker Rhulani Manzini faced the club’s disciplinary committee as a result of a training ground fight. Ndengane was found innocent last week and has since returned to training. He will be ready for their clash against log leaders Downs this afternoon. But Manzini was not so lucky as he was found guilty and is no longer part of Vhadau Vhadamani. His contract was terminated after the hearing. “Ndengane is back, which is good news for us,” said coach Dylan Kerr, who has now signed a contract until the end of the season. “Ndengane is one of our key defenders and we missed his experience against AmaZulu. He (Ndengane) looks fine and has put everything behind him. He wants to focus on helping Tshakhuma move away from the relegation zone.” Kerr also revealed that his assistant, David Mathebula, will be on the bench as he is still waiting for his work permit. On their clash against the 10th times PSL champions, the Englishman said: “Everyone knows that Sundowns have been doing well and we are expecting a tough game. “But we are not scared of them. We are going to this clash with a positive mind. We have Ndengane back and are playing at home. “We just need to stick to our game plan and avoid making mistakes at the back,” he said. Ndengane and his fellow defenders need to be at their best to stop the high-flying Downs duo of Themba Zwane and Peter Shalulile. Zwane and Shalulile have each netted eight goals this season.
