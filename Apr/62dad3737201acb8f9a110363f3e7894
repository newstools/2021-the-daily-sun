VICTORIES against Orlando Pirates and Wydad Athletic have boosted Kaizer Chiefs players mentally, according to Kaizer Chiefs striker Leonardo Castro. Heading into a DStv Premiership showdown against Stellenbosch on Tuesday at FNB Stadium (5pm), Castro believes they will be approaching the match in the right frame of mind, and are head to FNB Stadium with their tails wagging up high. Before the Fifa International break, Chiefs defeated their Soweto rivals Pirates 1-0, and after the break, they restored their hopes of making it into the Caf Champions League's quarter-finals when they edged Moroccan giants Wydad 1-0 at FNB Stadium. "These wins have given us a winning mentality," Castro told the club’s website. "It's a positive thing for us to have won these matches, so now we can go into this week's games with confidence – hopefully we get the results we want." However, Amakhosi are still outside the top eight bracket in the Premiership standings. They are position nine with 23 points, which they gathered in 19 games. Castro said they will treat the game against the Stellies as a cup final in their desperate attempt to solicit points from them, and move up the log standings. He added: "The next game is another final, so we have to take it. "We have to win the game so we can improve from our last performance. We need to take each and every game with responsibility so we can finish the season in good shape."
