Getting angry and destroying infrastructure that’s supposed to improve our lives as communities doesn’t help. I’e often seen residents destroy roads with burning tyres in the name of service delivery protests. In other instances, construction sites have been disturbed when locals demand job opportunities. The solution is to avoid protests and to change the ruling party. The date for the local government election has been announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa. This is the perfect opportunity for residents in different municipalities to do the right thing. Let’s move forward by choosing a governing party and ward councillors that will do real work. Judging by the number of service delivery protests we have seen over the years, it’s clear the ones we have are useless. Our vote should help us speak and break the chains of poverty.
