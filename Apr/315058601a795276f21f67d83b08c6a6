MEMBERS of the public should stop accepting help from strangers at ATMs. Criminals rob people by swapping their cards. When such situations happen, call the bank to report it so they can block your card, or go there immediately. These scumbags literally force their help on you when you did not ask for help in the first place. I now see why some people prefer using only cashback methods in-store because that is safer than using ATMs. Be alert and vigilant of the people around you at ATMs. Card swindlers are everywhere in Mzansi, so be careful and trust no one. If need be, seek help from security guards in uniform. Never allow anyone to help you or stand close to you. You cannot trust anyone. Be extra cautious. Banks need to do more to stop this type of theft and protect their clients. Rachel Molema Theresa Mews
