ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has admitted that their performance was not enough as Mamelodi Sundowns outclassed his side on Thursday evening. Sundowns hammered Pirates 4-1 in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal at Loftus Stadium. Sundowns are now going to face Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the tournament's semifinal on Sunday afternoon (3pm). "Sundowns was just too good, I'm honest with you. They have top players in the field. They play well in the (Caf) Champions League, in the league," Zinnbauer admitted. "The performance was not enough (from our side). Sundowns were too good. He added: "Maybe they (the Pirates players) had too much respect, I don't know, but after the game you don't have the right answer. I'll watch my game again and then we find the points where we have to improve for the next game." Goals from Peter Shalulile, Themba Zwane, Lesedi Kapinga, and Hlompho Kekana proved to be enough to knock out Pirates from the Ke Yona Cup competition. Tshegofatso Mabasa scored the only goal for Pirates. Bucs will now switch focus to the DStv Premiership when they welcome Maritzburg United to Orlando stadium on Monday. "We have to focus on the next games. We have to focus on the other tournament, CAF, and then we go forward. It's so. We have to accept it," Zinnbauer said.
