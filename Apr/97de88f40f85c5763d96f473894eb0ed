A Glen View landlord removed doors and the roof sheets from her house to force defaulting tenants to pay rent. The incident left four children on Saturday sleeping in the open as the landlord demanded that their mothers pay up. The tenants confirmed their failure to pay rent, arguing that Covid-19 negatively affected their sources of income. According to ZNNews.com, their effort to seek protection from the police in Glen View, Zimbabwe, hit a brick wall when law enforcement agencies referred them to the rent board for determination of their case. The tenants initially hired three men to stop any removal of doors and roofing sheets, but the landlord arrived in the company of a stronger team and ordered the removal. “The two gave excuses for the past nine months and the past three years they have not been paying water and electricity bills. “They should look for alternative accommodation,” said the landlord.
