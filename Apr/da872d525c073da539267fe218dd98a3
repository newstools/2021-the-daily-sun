MINISTER of sport Nathi Mthethwa has resolved to strip the Cricket SA of its power to run cricket in the country. The decision, applied through section 13(5) of the National Sports Act, followed after the Members' Council voted against amendments in the Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) (CSA’s constitution) to allow for the restructuring of the organisation’s administration. Mthethwa was left with no choice but to de-fund and de-recognised CSA, in accordance with section 13(5). “I have decided to invoke my powers under the Act‚ and I hereby notify you that I have done so by s13 (5)(i)-(iii) by de-funding CSA and de-recognising CSA‚ and I will cause this to be published in the Government Gazette in due course at the earliest opportunity,” said Mthethwa. “I will‚ as soon as possible‚ also inform the ICC of my decision and provide them with my reasons for doing so. “I have now applied my mind to the matter‚ including several facts that I have set out in this communication to you‚ and I have concluded that there remains an intractable irrational member of the MC (members council) members who are implacably opposed to changing the governance structure of CSA‚ particularly about a majority Independent Board‚ and an Independent Chairperson.” Mthethwa added they a minority of members (Members Council) cannot continue to hold cricket hostage. He said: “A majority of the Members Council (six) had already approved the IB proposals on 17 April 2021‚ and three of the council had elected to abstain. "Cricket cannot be held hostage by a minority [of] members of the Members Council.”
