SHE was woken up by community leaders on Thursday, 15 April, who told her to pack her things as she was moving to a new house. After she left, Red Ants demolished her shack. But it all turned out to be false and gogo was left with no place to live. Just as gogo Christina Motloung was trying to deal with the disappointment, community leaders told her to pack her things again as she was moving into a new house. This time, she even signed for the keys to the house. However, just as she about to move into the house, she was told her name was not on the list and she was turned back for the second time. The 60-year-old gogo from Ivory Park now feels this was a late April Fools’ joke. A number of people were allocated RDP houses at Clayville extension 31 near Olifantsfontein and gogo Christina was supposed to be one of the recipients. She is now squatting with a neighbour. The gogo said after she was snubbed the second time, community leaders gave her rusted old zinc and told her to rebuild her shack. “Why didn’t they say so if they didn’t have a house for me, instead of making a fool of me,” she said. “They gave me old zinc and took my new one. “Lord knows what they did with them!” Gogo Christina applied for an RDP house in 1996 and has been turned down more than four times. “I have given up because it seems these houses are allocated to those who are connected. I’m just poor and that’s why I won’t get it.” City of Ekurhuleni spokesman Zweli Dlamini said they will investigate the matter.
