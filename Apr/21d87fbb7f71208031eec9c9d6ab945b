Welcome back, king Mastermind.” Speaking about the return of the old cast, the show’s producer Mmamitse Thibedi told Daily Sun they have always wanted to bring them back. “We were just waiting for the right moment and with the exit of Thandeka, we thought this is the perfect opportunity. We were giving her a perfect exit and sort of a remembrance of where Uzalo started and is going,” she said. But she shared that they are not back for good, but urged viewers to keep watching as the storyline continues to develop. “Shooting with TK has been amazing. We missed him so much on set and the life that he brings to the story. We can’t wait for the viewers to see him in action.” A post shared by Uzalo Mon - Fri 8.30pm (@uzalo_sabc1)
