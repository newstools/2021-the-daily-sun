As long as the focus changes when the public decide to deviate from lawful protest to illegal ones, we will continue to blame the police when they enforce the law. Every time there’s a violent protest, attention turns to the reaction of the cops in handling and attending to such incidents. This week the N1 south in the Free State was blocked and barricaded. In the Eastern Cape, a nyala truck was torched. The police and innocent road users were pelted with stones, and the cops were forced to monitor the situation. In some instances, innocent lives are lost unintentionally and sadly the police find themselves on the wrong side of the law. But why is it that service delivery failures of some municipalities harm innocent road users and infrastructure? Who at the end of it all suffers when we destroy the very infrastructure that we will need in future? We are not doing anyone a favour by deviating from acceptable behaviour to lawlessness. I’m not against any legal protest. We all know it is our right to protest, but still, it is the right of those who tend not to participate to be respected as well. Let us respect our own police service also. Let us adhere to protocols of arranging marches and protesting. For service delivery, let us hold those in positions of power accountable and name and shame them. Let them vacate the office and allow service delivery to kick in. - Letter by Andries Monyane, Sedibeng
