AFROTAINMENT label owner DJ Tira is known for giving new talent a shot. One of his latest discoveries is Fezile Zulu, whose video went viral on social media. The 25-year-old from Eshowe, KZN, currently works as a dishwasher at Wimpy in Durban. In the video, she was asked to sing in exchange for bottles and the person recording it promised she would make sure Tira sees it. Many social media users were impressed by Fezile’s voice and after asking people to help him find her, Tira managed to track Fezile. They are currently in studio working on a song with Mondli Ngcobo. Fezile, who is an aspiring actress, said she’s been trying to break into the industry for years. She set scene and acted in the video in the hope someone would see it. She told Daily Sun it has always been her dream to work with Tira.  “I can’t believe he finally found me after months of sending him messages on Instagram. Growing up in poverty, I wanted to make something of myself. Let my story be an inspiration to others that your current situation is not your ever after. All you have to do is push hard,” she said. Fezile, who lives with her gogo, mum, younger sibling and two cousins, said they survived on money her granny made from selling sugarcane and dried up grass. Asked how she’s been handling the attention since Tira found her, she said: “I am scared and don’t even know what to say. People stop and congratulate me when I leave work because they know my story. It’s so humbling.” She thanked Tira that her dream was finally coming true. DJ Tira said he was blown away by Fezile’s video. “I had no idea she was acting, but I’m glad I found her. “Fezile is talented and anyone who wants to work with her is more than welcome. Mondli is an amazing producer and is putting in work to make her single amazing. We have more surprises for her and I hope she takes off as she is a star,” he said.
