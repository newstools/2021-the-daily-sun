SIPHOKUHLE Nomatyindyo washed her favourite jeans on Friday, 23 April, and hanged them on the washing line. Shortly thereafter, the 27-year-old from Ramaphosa squatter camp in Cape Town was shocked to see smoke coming from her wet clothes. “I was confused at first and thought it was vutha burning the clothes. I quickly ran to my neighbour’s house and was told not to touch my washing line as it might be izinyoka,” she said. “I removed the clothes with a broom, but the fire had already made holes.” Siphokuhle said things got worse when her four-year-old kid was shocked when he touched the shack. Luckily, the child was not seriously injured. Residents then realised izinyoka wires had come into contact with her shack and the metal wire on her washing line. “I’m happy my son is alive. It could have worked out differently if he was not wearing shoes. God and our ancestors saved my son, and I’m grateful,” she said. “We then asked the local guys to help us cut the line and remove the wires making contact with my shack.” Community leader Phakamani Londile (45) was happy no one was harmed. “It could have been deadly. We urge residents to always be careful when it comes to izinyoka,” he said. Residents of the Mxenge area have long been complaining about Ramaphosa community members illegally connecting to their electricity, causing power outages. When the SunTeam previously approached the municipality, officials said they couldn’t connect the squatter camp as it was on private land. Energy MMC Phindile Maxiti said: “The informal settlement was located on private land and the city did not have approval from the landowner to provide services on this land parcel.”
