AB de Villiers is eyeing a sensational return to the Proteas set-up ahead of the T20 World Cup later this year. The ex-Proteas captain, who retired from all forms of the game three years ago, has been in sizzling form in the Indian Premier League where he plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore. De Villiers (37) has confirmed talks with Proteas coach Mark Boucher and Cricket SA Director of Cricket, Graeme Smith, with a view of making a comeback. “We have been talking about it. Already last year he asked me if I would be interested and I said ‘absolutely’,” said De Villiers. “Coming into the IPL, we will look at where we are with regard to my form and fitness. If I can slot in there, it will be fantastic for all these things to fall into place. I am waiting for Boucher towards the end of IPL and then we will plan accordingly. “I have never been an ego player who will go out there and say I am Mr 360. I am going to play all the shots in the book. “I rather want to play the situation to the best of my ability. I think I did that well and always do it well.” Boucher has confirmed talks with De Villiers, who sounded keen to don the green and gold again. “I did chat to him before he went to the IPL,” Boucher said. “The conversation is still very much open. AB being the person he is, he wanted to perform very well at the IPL, to prove to himself and everyone else that he is still a very key figure in world cricket and could dominate at that level.” Before he retired, De Villiers had played 114 Test matches, 228 ODIs and 78 T20 internationals. He is remembered for his fastest century, off 31 balls, in an ODI six years ago. The T20 World Cup will start in India in October.
