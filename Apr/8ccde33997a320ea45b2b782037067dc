Musician, Sarafina! star Khanyo Maphumulo is back by popular demand. She has released an album titled Khumbul’ekhaya and was excited about her work being out. She told SunBuzz: “The album was produced by Mthandeni Mvelase and has 12 tracks. It was released last week and is already available on digital stores. “I composed all the songs on this album and I worked with a maskandi artist, Mfiliseni Magubane. My favourite song is called Zikode.” The star said the album was suitable for everyone and each song focused on different aspects of life such as love, family and heritage. “I can describe this album as one of my best musical projects. I say this because it has different genres such as gospel, Afro-pop and maskandi.” ALSO READ | ZODWA'S ARVS SPARK DEBATE! The last time Khanyo released an album was 10 years ago and she was on the verge of quitting music when she was convinced otherwise. “The lack of support from my own country had discouraged me from continuing with music. As a result, I’d taken a decision to stop doing music. “Fortunately, my fans and friends convinced me not to give up. Every time I would walk in public, my fans would tell me how they are anticipating my next album,” she recalled. “I made the final decision not to quit music when I met up with Ntokozo Siluma, director of Joy of Grace Entertainment, who convinced and signed me under the company. That is how this album was made.” She believed the album was long overdue. “I’m glad it’s finally out. I’m truly grateful to Ntokozo and my fans for reviving my calling. I’d missed being on stage and comforting them,” she said. Khanyo has been in the entertainment industry for 33 years. She said her love for music started at the age of six, but she started singing professionally at the tender of age of 13 when she was cast for lead vocals in the iconic musical drama Sarafina! “I’ve had good and memorable experiences in showbiz. I just wish I can get more support from home,” she said.
