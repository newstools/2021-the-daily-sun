TWO taxis were torched and 28 others damaged during violence between two rival associations in Middelburg, Mpumalanga. The war between the Nasaret District Taxi and Mhluzi Taxi associations started in 2015 and resumed on Monday, 29 March, leaving several drivers injured and hospitalised with gunshot wounds.” Others reportedly disappeared! Speaking to Daily Sun, NDTA members accused municipal officials and police officers of siding with their rivals because they had taxis operating in the area. “Several times we went to the Middelburg cop shop to press charges against Mhluzi Taxi Association members for damaging and burning our taxis, assaulting us with pangas, shooting at us and kidnapping our members. “But police started arresting and charging us for assaulting them. They side with Mhluzi members because some cops at the Middelburg Police Station and Steve Tshwete Municipality officials have taxis operating in that route. Cops escort rivals to attack us and damage our taxis.” Acting municipal spokeswoman Lerato Kgomo said: “Concerned association members should come forward with the names of the alleged officials they’re accusing of owning taxis. We’ll take it from there.” Several attempts by the SunTeam to get hold of Mhluzi for comment failed. Colonel Donald Mdhluli said: “Police are investigating about 35 cases opened by individuals in the taxi industry in Middelburg and surrounding areas. “These include attempted murder, assault and malicious damage to property, among others. “A team of investigators has been assembled to probe the cases, and six suspects have been arrested on allegations of attempted murder.” One suspect appeared in the Middelburg Magistrates Court on Thursday, 1 April. The remaining five are expected to appear on Tuesday, 6 April.
