CHRIS Hani died almost three decades ago, but that’s not long enough to heal the wounds for the SACP and his widow, Limpho. On Saturday, during the 28th anniversary of Hani’s death, party secretary-general Blade Nzimande said those who plotted to murder Hani not only killed a political leader. “We also want them to know they killed a father, a husband and a human being,” he said. He said assassin, Polish immigrant Janusz Walus, must rot in prison. “That’s why we say today, the fact that the whole truth hasn’t come out about the circumstances that led to his assassination, Walus must rot in jail,” he said. “We’re not saying this because we have evil hearts. We need to know the whole truth about what happened to Hani in 1993. That’s why we remain strongly opposed to the release of Walus.” He said those who claim to have information about Hani’s assassination but never shared that with the police or the TRC are irresponsible and reckless. “We condemn that. They’re acting in a factionalist fashion,” he said. He said Hani was in the struggle whole-heartedly, not for himself but for the overwhelming majority of the people. ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa said: “Chris Hani wasn’t the kind of leader who, through reckless behaviour, ill-discipline and self-serving actions, would divide his movement and polarise the nation. “That was not Chris. He embodied the revolutionary qualities we need in our leaders today.” He said Hani wasn’t afraid to raise concerns about the state of his movement and the conduct of his leaders.
