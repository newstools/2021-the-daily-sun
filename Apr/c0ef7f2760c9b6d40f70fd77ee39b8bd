FAILURE to meet contract renewal deadlines for sports presenters has angered Ukhozi FM listeners. This because the station has had one presenter doing sports bulletins the whole day since Thursday, 1 April at the beginning of the new season for SABC radio stations. Nolwazi Machi has been presenting sports from the breakfast to the afternoon show and over the weekend. While hosting the afternoon show on Sunday, 4 April she announced that other presenters would be back but didn’t state the date. “I know you have been wondering what happened to other presenters such as Victor Molefe, Irvin Sihlophe, Mhlonishwa Sibisi and Thulisile Miya. They will be back,” she said. On Thursday, the show that was presented by Victor was not aired. Instead, music was played with no explanation. It also didn’t air on Monday. Instead, Lee Hlophe played music. A source told Daily Sun there was a big problem at SABC Sports. The source said the department was removed from the head offices and Ukhozi was given powers to sign sports presenters like they do others. “Many sports presenters have not renewed their contracts, except for Nolwazi, who has a different one. She has rescued the sports department over the past days by working overtime while other presenters are still negotiating their contracts,” said the source. SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo told Daily Sun the weekday sports show presenter would be announced once internal processes have been finalised. “The station can confirm that there are two sports bulletin presenters, but the corporation does not discuss employment contracts in the public space,” she said.
