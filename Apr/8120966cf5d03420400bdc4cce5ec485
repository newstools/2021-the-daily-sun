JUSTICE has been served. Nwabisa Nkazana (37) and roommate Thandazile Shushu (30) are going to spend a long time behind bars for the murder of Nkazana’s four-year-old son. On Thursday, 8 April, both the mother and her friend were sentenced to life imprisonment and five years each for defeating the ends of justice. In 2019, Nkazana killed her four-year-old son and asked Shushu to help hide the body inside a chest of drawers. Then they went out partying. When they heard the community of Madelakufa in Tembisa was planning a house-to-house search, they put the body inside the wreck of a car. The mother went to the police to report a neighbour that was harassing her. But while there, the community found the body and called the police. Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha said the mother reported her child missing on 12 August 2019 while she was busy with house chores. Ralidzivha said police, including the dog unit, went all out looking for him. On the day the community decided to search all houses, cops were called to a gruesome find at the disused car parked at Madelakufa 2. “The mother went with the police to the vehicle and identified the child,” Ralidzivha said. A murder case was opened and handed over to Detective Sergeant Malesela Moloantoa for investigation. Ralidzivha said after the burial, Nkazana was seen trying to flee the area, but the community stopped her. The truth came out after the arrest of both women. “One turned state witness and revealed that the mother killed her son, put his body in a bag and hid it in the chest of drawers.” During trial, the witness said Shushu confessed what the mother did, and that she had helped. The station commander praised the community for helping.
