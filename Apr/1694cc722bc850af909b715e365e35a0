TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) have vowed to deal with any team they will face in the Nedbank Cup semifinals on Sunday. TTM are waiting for the winner between Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, who will play their quarterfinal fixture on Thursday afternoon. Dylan Kerr, coach of TTM, said they do not have any preference. They will be ready for any team that comes their way to reach the final and possibly win the Ke Yona Cup. "You have to beat the rest and be the best," Kerr told SunSport on Tuesday. "We do not have any predilection any team that wins we will be prepared for them." Kerr, who revealed that many people advised him not to take the TTM coaching job because it will ruin his reputation, said he worked tirelessly to change the players' mentality. "I believe in what I am doing," Kerr said. On Saturday, TTM registered an impressive victory beating TS Galaxy 2-0 in a league match. Kerr believes they are slowly heading in the right direction. He added: "I told them (players) not to think financially. Football is not about money. It is about winning things; 97% of the players in this team it is their last chance to lift silverware with the Nedbank Cup. "So, I told them to give it their best shot and win. I know nobody believe or fancies us to win anything and we have to go against the odds."
