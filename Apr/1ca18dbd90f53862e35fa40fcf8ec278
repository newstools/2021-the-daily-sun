Harry Kane is set to stay at Tottenham Hotspur this summer with the club refusing to let him join another Premier League team, TheSun.co.uk reports. And unless the big guns in Spain are able to come up with the £175million (R3,5 billion) that would be needed to get the England captain out, Kane, 27, accepts he will be a Spurs player next season. Kane, who has 27 goals this campaign, is set to finish as Tottenham’s top scorer for the seventh season running and needs another 52 to beat Jimmy Greaves’ club record of 266.
