A DRIVER is expected to appear in the Ladysmith Magistrates Court tomorrow. The 19-year-old was arrested for driving under the influence and being involved in a tragic accident that killed four people yesterday. It’s alleged three cars collided on the N11 in Elandslaagte, KZN. EMRS spokesman Robert McKenzie confirmed the accident, saying paramedics treated six patients at the scene. “One man, two women and one child died,” he said. Captain Nqobile Gwala said cases of culpable homicide and drunken driving were being investigated by Elandslaagte police. “It’s alleged that this morning at 5.30am, the family members were driving in two vehicles on the N11 near Elandslaagte when they were involved in an accident with another car,” said Gwala. She said four family members, aged between three and 32, were declared dead at the scene. The other four, travelling in another vehicle, sustained critical injuries and were rushed to hospital. “The other three occupants in another car sustained minor injuries. A 19-year-old driver was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. He’ll appear in the Ladysmith Magistrates Court tomorrow,” said Gwala.
