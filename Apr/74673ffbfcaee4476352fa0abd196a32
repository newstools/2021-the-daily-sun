NYANGA top cop Brigadier Vuyisile Ncata has told residents and LGBTI groups that investigations into the murder of Lonwabo Jack are almost complete. He said this after a group of over 100 people gathered at the cop shop on Saturday. Ncata said cops found a bloody knife, and also took to the lab the semen found on Jack’s private parts. “The knife that was used to kill Jack was found, and it had blood on it. All the things that were found inside his private parts have been taken to the lab so we can find out who the suspect is. It’s just a matter of time,” said Ncata. The groups had been demanding justice for Jack, a gay man who was killed while celebrating his birthday on Sunday, 18 April in Mau-Mau in Nyanga. His body was found next to his friend’s house who had hosted the birthday. The community and various organisations from ekasi then took to the streets to demand justice. One suspect has since been arrested and appeared in court on Wednesday. Ncata said: “We’re thankful that the community is assisting. If we continue to work together like this, we will eliminate crime in our kasi. “Today we have a #justiceforlonwabo, but we don’t want another hashtag in Nyanga. If we work together, we can clean this area.” EFF councillor Banzi Dambuza said: “As the EFF, let this position be clear: if the perpetrator comes out we’re going to supersede the cops and take the matter into our own hands. This is because police are failing. Theyïre doing nothing to protect our people.”
