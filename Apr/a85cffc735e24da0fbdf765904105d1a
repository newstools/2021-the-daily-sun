Marriage is supposed to be a noble thing because love has brought together two people who want to start a family. In recent years, a union of marriage has somewhat turned into a hellhouse because of the way couples treat each other. The future looks rosy between the couples when they decide to tie the knot. They do it because they both feel they have finally met their soulmate. You marry someone who has proven to have needed tender loving care. What makes most marriages toxic is that we completely stop nurturing our love after the honeymoon phase. Married couples stop going out together as they used to before marriage. The elements that encouraged them to tie the knot get thrown away. A man no longer opens a car door for his partner. Our relationships begin to be toxic. That’s when we seek happiness elsewhere. Married couples should continue going out on picnics and keep nurturing and celebrating their love forever. They will raise happy and responsible kids. Men should spend most of their time with their partners, not with friends or going to parties. You chose to build a happy life together when you get married. Create everlasting happiness in your marriage. - Letter by Matome Kubu, Arcadia
