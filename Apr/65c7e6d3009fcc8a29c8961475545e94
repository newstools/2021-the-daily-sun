A family screamed for help after their car had plunged down a ravine on the R511 in the Hennops River area on Sunday, ER24 said. Spokesperson Ross Campbell said when paramedics arrived, along with Metro Police and the SA Police Service, they found the vehicle had rolled down the ravine. "The family had been shouting for help from the bottom," said Campbell.
