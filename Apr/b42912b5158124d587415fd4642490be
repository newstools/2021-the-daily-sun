PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa is appearing at the Zondo Commission on Wednesday morning. His two-day testimony is likely to be about his knowledge or lack thereof of the things that happened during the era of State Capture. Ramaphosa was deputy president of both the ANC and the country at the time. Former president Jacob Zuma who was head of state through the era has snubbed the commission.   He alleged that the chairman of the commission deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo was biased against him. He even disobeyed the Constitutional Court order that compelled him to the inquiry and give evidence about what he knows. Ramaphosa, on the other hand, has always expressed his willingness to appear before Zondo. He was scheduled to give evidence in his capacity as the president of the ANC on 22 and 23 April and come back on 28 and 29 in his capacity as president of Mzansi. But it was announced last week that his dates have been moved after he requested to have his evidence heard at a later date. "That has changed in part because the president requested in connection with dates of 22 and 23 April because of some commitments that had arisen. I have acceded to the request to change those dates," said Zondo. He said Ramaphosa would appear today in his capacity as president of the ANC and again on 13 and 14 May in his capacity as president of Mzansi.  Everyone knows that I do not agree with President Cyril Ramaphosa on soo many issues..My disagreements however do not blind me to some right things he does and certainly his attendance at Zondo Commission today is good for democracy and accountability.Nobody is above the Law! pic.twitter.com/ZUyeiXaMZi  Today’s testimony is not about how much you like President Cyril Ramaphosa. It’s about holding the ANC accountable as an institution for decades of deceit and destructive corruption. And that accountability must be pursued unapologetically and aggressively. #StateCaptureInquiry President Cyril Ramaphosa opening statement in case you missed it #StateCaptureInquiry #StateCaptureCommission #ZondoCommission pic.twitter.com/fq9DiHO6Ri  #StateCaptureInquiry Does President Cyril Ramaphosa know what Norma said about Cadre Deployment pic.twitter.com/RFLSafNgCe
