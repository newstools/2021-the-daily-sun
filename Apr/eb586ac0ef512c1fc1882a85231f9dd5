THE mood was sombre in Tshirenzheni Village near Siloam just outside Makhado, Limpopo, yesterday as family and friends paid tribute to Lufuno Mavhunga. The 15-year-old committed suicide soon after a video of her being attacked by a fellow pupil went viral on social media on Monday, 12 April. The grade 10 pupil was described as a cool, brilliant and independent thinker who dreamt of becoming a doctor. Family spokesman, Kenneth Mavhunga said the family was still in pain. “Her death has left a void which will be difficult to fill. It will also be difficult to forget her good morals, respect and willingness to take education seriously. “Her name means love in English and it resembled who she was. Her attacker should have left her alone,” said Kenneth. He said Lufuno was a brilliant pupil and that was the reason the family took her to Mbilwi Secondary School, which is one of the best performing schools in the province. LUFUNO'S BULLY ARRESTED! Thovhele Gole Mphaphuli, a senior traditional leader, described Lufuno’s death as a terrible blow to the school and community at large. “Her contribution to the school would have helped to add value to the school’s astonishing matric results. “The death of one pupil is one too many for the school. We want to urge other pupils to concentrate on learning and teaching to avoid bad situations like what happened,” said Mphaphuli. Lufuno will be buried in Tshirenzheni Village on Saturday, 17 April. Meanwhile, a Good Samaritan has offered to help bury Lufuno. Livhuwani Madazhe, owner of Twins Funeral Parlour, told Daily Sun: “The family showed interest in taking our offer. We are just waiting for them to come back to us.” Livhuwani said he decided to help as he was also touched by the incident.
