ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule fired shots at the party’s National Executive Committee today. He reminded the party that the radical economic transformation policy was adopted at the 54th national conference in Nasrec. This after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced NEC resolutions warning members against attending any RET Forces meetings organised by the faction rallying behind Magashule. “The Radical Economic Transformation policy was adopted at Nasrec. You can’t actually change and turn it around and call it something else,” said Magashule. “The economy must be in the hands of the African people. There’s no country in the world where the majority are not the owners of the economy.” He was speaking during the ANC commemoration of Charlotte Maxeke in Kliptown in Soweto on Wednesday, 7 April. It kicked off with wreath-laying at her grave at Nancefield Cemetery and a visit to her house in Kliptown. He said church leaders should play a role in ensuring former president Nelson Mandela’s dream of lifting people out of poverty was realised. Magashule, under fire to step aside due to criminal charges, said after being advised by the elders he’d meet Ramaphosa privately before announcing his decision. “We’re consulting and I’ll meet with President Cyril Ramaphosa. I’ve said the internal processes of the ANC must be left to the ANC.”
