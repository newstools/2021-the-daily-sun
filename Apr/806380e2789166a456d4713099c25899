SIBUSISO was never lost – he was taken by the ancestors for training! When Sibusiso Mnisi (23) disappeared in September, his heartbroken mum Promise Motshele (44) from Tsakane opened a missing persons case and even brought his photo to Daily Sun. But it turned out Sibusiso was taken to the river to train as a sangoma! He completed the training in March. Sibusiso, who’s unemployed, saidon the day the ancestors took him he was on his way to work in Brakpan when something told him to get off the taxi back in September. He found himself walking on Heidelberg Road. He said the ancestral spirits led him to a river in the dense bushes near Geluksdal in Ekurhuleni. “I sat down on the banks of the river and fell asleep.” He said when he woke up he saw an old man standing next to him. “He told me I mustn’t be afraid. He was going to train me as a sangoma.” Sibusiso said he forgot everything – even his home address. He spent many days with the old man. “We were in and out of the river. I was taught how to dig for muthi and we performed rituals,” he said. He said he was never hungry. The spirits led him to a sangoma’s house in Geluksdal, where his training continued. “My memory slowly came back. I remembered my mum’s cell number.” His mum was contacted and told to come to the house as there was a graduation ceremony. Promise wasn’t interested as she’s a Christian. “The caller didn’t say Sibusiso was with them. I guess they wanted to surprise me,” she said. When she went to the house she was shocked to find her son. “It was such a relief. I thank Daily Sun for publishing his photo,” said Promise. Sangoma Dungamanzi said amadlozi can take you underwater to train you if you don’t comply.
