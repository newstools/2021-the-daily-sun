FOUR suspects linked to the murder of two brothers in Piet Retief, Mpumalanga will appear in court today, 12 April. Amos Coka and Zenzele Coka were among a group of people who went to speak to the farmer about job opportunities since it is harvesting season. It is alleged that the farm supervisors started arguing with their friend and later took him inside a storeroom where they allegedly assaulted him. The Coka brothers were shot while trying to save their friend. Farm Residence Workers and Labour Tenants Association leader, Bongani Hlatshwayo, told Daily Sun that last year they had a meeting with the farmer, to ask him to prioritise people living on the farm when there were job opportunities. 12/04/2021 There's heavy police presence outside the Piet Retief magistrate's court in Mpumalanga as four farmers accused of shooting and killing 2 attackers. pic.twitter.com/PRssrj6UKo
