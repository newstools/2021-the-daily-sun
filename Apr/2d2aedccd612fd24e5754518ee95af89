Skeem Saam actor Clement Maosa wants to use his law degree to better the entertainment industry. The talented actor, who plays troubled Kwaito Seakamela on the SABC1 soapie, recently revealed that once he gets admitted as an advocate, he’ll major in entertainment law. “As soon as I get my admission as an advocate, I want to major in entertainment law and represent artists and their rights, particularly musicians,” he said. “Entertainers play a vital role in society, but they’re often neglected, exploited and not valued.” Clement, whose parents were against him studying acting, also opened up about how his University of Limpopo law degree has helped him in his career.

I realised my LLB degree is helping me a lot, especially when I had to negotiate contracts. I’m very familiar with law and clauses. “But I’m not just doing this for myself. I also want to help others. “You’ll be shocked that there are so many artists who’re being ripped off. So, I would like to open up a firm where I can assist artist with such problems.” A post shared by Clementmaosa (@clementmaosa)
