NOTORIOUS Farouk Meyer is no more. He died in what residents described as an assassination. At the time of his death, he was with Marcus Ryan, a well-known businessman. Farouk Meyer was closing his spare shop when men armed to the teeth fired a large number of shots at him.   Ryan was caught in the cross fire. "Marcus was shot, he collapsed and died on the scene," said an eye witness. "Farouk was sitting in the passenger seat when he was shot many times. They took him to Bara (Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital) and he died there," said the eye witness. Some residents celebrated the death of Farouk, while others are mourning him. One resident took to Twitter and said after four years her grandparents are resting. She alleged he had killed them. Provincial cop spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said police have launched a manhunt while investigating the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of two men on Monday, 26 April around 5.40pm near an auto spares shop on Boundary Road in Eldorado Park, Joburg. "According to preliminary reports at the disposal of the police, a witness heard gunshots and on investigation noticed a vehicle riddled with bullet holes," she said. She said two unknown occupants were both shot and the driver was declared dead on the scene while the second victim succumbed to injuries and was declared dead at the hospital he had been rushed to for medical attention. "Police are at an early stage in the investigation and are not at liberty to disclose or confirm the identities of the deceased," said Peters. She added that the motive for the shooting is unclear at this stage. Police are appealing to anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrator(s) to urgently contact police by calling the crime stop number 08600 10111 or via the MySAPS app. All information will be treated with the strictest confidence.
