It’s often said that one’s ability to operate in small, confined spaces says a lot about one’s skill set. Tight spaces are always the best to operate in, says football genius Pep Guardiola. The same analogy can be attributed to a tight punani. A lot has been said about a tight punani and how enjoyable it is during sex. The tightness of the punani is attributed to a lot of things sexually. According gynaecologists Dr Manu Lakshmi, vaginal tightness during sex is dependent on the sexual arousal and pelvic floor muscles around the punani. The sexual arousal determines how the pelvic floor muscles contract or relax during sex. The feeling of sexual arousal relaxes the muscles, making the vaginal space less constricted or looser. On the other hand, feelings of anxiety make the muscles become more engaged and tighter. According to Dr Lakshmi, here are some of the natural ways to keep your punani tight and healthy: 1. A Good Diet A good diet that will improve inner muscle strength and thus contribute to better vaginal health. Eating a healthy diet that’s high in fibre can help maintain a healthy body weight and reduce the chances of frequent constipation that can cause weakening of pelvic muscles. 2. Reduce Stress The pelvic floor can be kept stronger by controlling stress. 3. Kegel Exercises Kegel exercises are one of the most recommended and popular ways of tightening the punani. The clench and release exercise is what constitutes the kegel exercise. The kegel exercise is the action of engaging the pelvic floor muscles, holding for 5–10 seconds and releasing. This is done about 5-10 times in a row, a few times a day. 4. Squatting Squats are good for pelvic floor toning and vaginal tightening.
