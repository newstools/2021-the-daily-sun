A 37-YEAR-OLD City Power employee was arrested over the weekend after trying to defraud a customer in Troyeville, Joburg. In a statement, City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said it was alleged that the official went to the customer’s workplace in Wilhemina Street and lied that he was there to audit the meter. “After fiddling with the meter box, the staff member is said to have demanded an amount of about R780 to reconnect the customer. “The quick-thinking customer locked the City Power staffer in and called law enforcement agencies,” he said. Mangena said Joburg’s Group Forensics and JMPD responded and arrested the suspect. “He allegedly confessed that he was not authorised to do an audit on the customer’s meter, as he didn’t have a job card. “He was arrested and booked at Jeppe Police Station for the weekend,” added Mangena. He said the suspect will appear in court on Monday to face charges of fraud, malicious damage to property and contravention of Section 3(a) of the Criminal Matters Amendment Act. Meanwhile, City Power CEO Mongezi Ntsokolo welcomed the arrest and said they had zero tolerance for corruption within their structure. “This should serve as a warning to other staff members that their job is to provide a service to the residents and not steal from them. “We call on other customers to desist from bribing our employers and rather report them when they ask for money, to the police or our security,” said Ntsokolo.
