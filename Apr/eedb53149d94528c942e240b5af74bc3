THE DA in Gauteng will submit a complaint to the Legislature’s integrity commissioner about Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. This comes after allegations of corruption around the awarding of tenders to schools emerged in media reports earlier this week. On Sunday, City Press published an article about a voice recording of a meeting between Lesufi and his team last May, allegedly exposing his involvement in the awarding of his department’s tenders. Speaking to Daily Sun on Wednesday, 7 April, DA Gauteng shadow MEC for education Khume Ramulifho said the mandate of the integrity commissioner was to investigate any possible violations of the code by members of the Legislature. “The commissioner must investigate what transpired during the meeting, and if Lesufi violated the code,” he said. Ramulifho said the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown had exposed mass corruption in the provincial government, filled with irregular tenders as well as fruitless and wasteful expenditure while residents continued to suffer economic hardship. “We’re calling on individuals to bring forward any information and evidence on Lesufi’s alleged tender interference so it can be presented before the integrity commissioner. “Should the commissioner find that Lesufi is implicated in these allegations, it will be a clear indication he’s no longer fit to head the Department of Education and that he must face severe consequences for his actions.”
