CONCERT series, Bassline Live at the Lyric Theatre is returning after a year-long break. It is coming back next month with Ami Faku, Msaki and Zoe Modiga on the line-up. The last concert was held last year in March with Lira, but had to pause due to Covid-19. Brad Holmes of Bassline Live said they’re happy to be back. The three-concert series will be held at Lyric Theatre in Goldreef City, Joburg. “After a year-long hiatus, the Bassline Live at the Lyric Theatre is back bringing fans of real live music experience, and what they’ve been missing through the last year. We are breathing a sigh of relief and are excited to once again be doing what we love to do. And that’s live, quality, original and proudly African music,” he said. He said they chose Ami, Zoe and Msaki because they are rising stars. ALSO READ | NTHATI’S SKELETONS BACK TO HAUNT HER! Brad said: “With the focus of this three-concert series being development of the music industry and employment, Bassline has hand-picked artists who are seriously on the rise and some who are soon to be rising stars.” “In keeping with the Bassline’s long-standing relationships and shows with our South African Divas since 1994, from Miriam Makeba, Dolly Rathebe, Thandie Klaasen, Busi Mhlongo, Simphiwe Dana, Lira, Thandiswa Mazwai to the recently late Sibongile Khumalo, who have all graced our stages, from the Melville Jazz Club to the Newtown Concert Hall and over the past four years Live at the Lyric Theatre, Bassline will be continuing its support for our divas by headlining three female songbirds who are all unique in their own right,” he said. Zoë, Msaki and Ami won’t be alone, but will be gracing the stage with up-and-coming musicians. Ami Faku will be paired with band, Urban Village on 8 May. Msaki with Moonga K on 15 May.
