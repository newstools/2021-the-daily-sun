MAMELODI Sundowns have signed Devine Lunga and Sipho Mbule from Golden Arrows and SuperSport United respectively. SunSport has reliably learnt that the duo have signed pre-contracts with the Brazilians. But Abafana Bes’thende defender Lunga and Matsatsantsa a Pitori’s 23-year-old midfielder Mbule will join the 10th times DStv Premiership champions at the end of the season. “Sundowns have won the two players’ signature,” said our source. “It is a done deal, Mbulu and Lunga have already signed and are just waiting for the season to end. Do you think there is any player who can refuse to join Sundowns? “These players want to win trophies and play regular football in Africa. Sundowns always challenge for the domestic championship and the Caf Champions League.” Mbule, who joined United in 2017 at the age of 19, has been growing each season at the three times PSL champions. This season, the Bethlehem-born midfielder has been one of the trusted players for United coach Kaitano Tembo. Lunga, the Zimbabwean international, has played 18 matches for Arrows this season and the 25-year-old defender’s form has been impressive. But Downs Legal and Commercial manager Yogesh Singh poured cold water over the duo’s signing with Tshwane giants. “I don’t know anything about the two players signing with Sundowns,” said Singh. “When we sign players we make an announcement on the club’s website. Check our website if there is any announcement.”
