COPS in the Eastern Cape are on the heels of robbery suspects who stole goods worth more than R111 000. The family was robbed at their farmhouse in Alicedale while having dinner on Wednesday night. Following the robbery, acting Sarah Baartman district Municipality commissioner Brigadier John Lebok immediately set up a task team to track, trace and arrest the five suspects. According to police spokeswoman Colonel Sibongile Soci, it is alleged that the unknown suspects entered the farmhouse where the family of three, aged 37, 48 and 49, were having dinner. One of the victims, who was visiting the family at the time, managed to run away and was later located to a nearby game reserve, unharmed. “The suspects bound one of the victim’s hands with a leash and took the other to go open the safe,” said Soci. Four firearms, two shotguns, a 9mm pistol, .38 revolver and an undisclosed amount of cash in dollars were stolen, according to Soci. “The suspects also robbed them of jewellery and an iPhone.” The estimated value of all stolen property was R111 000. Soci said the victims were unharmed, and the suspects fled on foot. Police called upon anyone with information on the robbery or the whereabouts of these suspects to contact Detective Warrant Officer Quintin Arnold on 082 416 8707, Alicedale police on 042 231 1154 or their nearest police station.
