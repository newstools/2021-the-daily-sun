AUTHOR Jackie Phamotse is looking for new actors for her movie. Bare the Blesser’s Game is an adaptation of her book with the same title. Taking to Twitter, she wrote: “I’ve made a decision to predominantly take on new faces for my movie – people who’ll live out the story as raw as the book is and completely give everything to break out! No one believed in me. It’s time to change someone’s life!” In a follow-up tweet, she said she’d been waiting a long time for the opportunity, and now that it’s happening she couldn’t be happier. “Been praying for this season in my life for years. Others laughed at me and mocked me at every turn, yet I stayed on my course,” she wrote. “I believe in my work so much. I’ve sacrificed everything for my work. I lost so much, but here we’re reading movie scripts! I’m releasing more books.” ALSO READ | BOITY'S WINNING STREAK! Datails of the movie will be announced at the launch of her new book, Liwa.
