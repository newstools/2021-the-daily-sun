The South African Football Association have already concluded their search for a new Bafana Bafana coach. According to the federation, they will announce the new head coach on Saturday. Among international coaches vying for the top job to replace Molefi Ntseki are Portuguese national from Mozambique Carlos Queiroz, Frenchman Herve Renard and Belgian Hugo Broos. The trio are last men standing and one could have easily accepted the offer with final touches to the contract negotiated. SunSport understands that the race is actually between Quieroz and Renard.
