A 30-YEAR-OLD blind woman was walking with her six-year-old son on a railway platform when he accidentally slipped and fell onto the tracks. In the video, a pointsman can be seen running towards the boy and lifting him onto the platform seconds before a train arrived, at Vangani station in Thane district in India. Speaking to the Indian Express, the pointsman, who has worked with the railways for five years, said: “I was on the tracks. My work was to give the green signal to Udyan Express. It was just me and the station master standing on the platform. “I saw Udyan Express heading towards the child. I had to save his life and started running towards him. Within seconds I got scared and thought of backing out. I even slowed down. But I could not see him die and started running again,” said Mayur Shelkhe. Excellent work done by Central Railway Mumbai Division Mr Mayur Shelkhe (Pointsman) saved the life of a child who lost his balance while walking at plateform no. 2 at Vangani station. pic.twitter.com/91G0ClQtWG
