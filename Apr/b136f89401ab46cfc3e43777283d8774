JUST two days after gogo Jostina Sangweni was buried, her family had to face her alleged killers. The suspects, Taello Dipholo and Colleen Sello, made their second appearance in the Protea Magistrates Court yesterday. Their case was postponed for bail application. Sangweni was burnt allegedly by residents after she was found in someone’s yard. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane said she was allegedly attacked for wearing traditional healers’ attire. “The NPA is working closely with the police to guide the ongoing investigation into her death. “The possibility of more arrests cannot be ruled out at this stage,” she said. Gogo Jostina’s son-in-law, Jabu Moagi, said going to court added salt to their fresh wound. “It’s difficult for the family to come to terms with her death. Having to face the suspects is something else. We are happy two suspects were arrested and hope more will be brought to book,” said Jabu. He said he was aware this was only the beginning, but they found comfort in knowing police were working tirelessly to find more suspects.
