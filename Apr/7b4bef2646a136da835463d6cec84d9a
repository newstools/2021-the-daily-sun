  A 1-1 league draw away at Dobsonville Stadium, against Moroka Swallows was hardly an ideal result for a coach who is hanging on to his job by a threat. Fawaaz Basadien opened the scoring while Sipho Mbule levelled for the visitors. But there is certainly determination from United players to ensure Tembo survives the chop. Matsatsantsa came into the game on a back of a 13-match winless run, a result enough for the likes of Chippa Mpengesi to pull the trigger. But on the performance of his team, Tembo will make a case for his retention. It is a matter of time before Matsatsantsa can turn the corner, seen as Bradley Grobler missed a glorious opportunity to seal a win towards the end. Brendan Truter cut a forlorn figure on the touchline, watching his team play out yet another draw. The Birds have now drawn 15 games, a record of sorts for the team in their first season back in the Premiership. They could not hold on to their lead after they had taken the lead through Basadien, who headed in Mokoenaâ€™s fine cross on the stroke of half time.         Daniel Goza could have secured maximum points, missing on two occasions, including the free header. A draw was not a fair result, but the Birds will need to do much better to arrest the slide which could cost them a top-eight spot.
