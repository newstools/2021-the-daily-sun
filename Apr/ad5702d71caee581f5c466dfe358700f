SWALLOWS FC defender Sifiso Hlanti and Skeem Saam actor Mr Kgomo have a striking resemblance. Could it be that they are related? Or is it just another case of unrelated lookalikes. Nevertheless, you would be forgiven to mistake one for the other, despite the age difference between the two. Hlanti and Mr Kgomo, whose real name is Lebohang Elephant, share such a resemblance that some believe they must have been separated at birth. Hlanti, who was born in Durban, is a professional football player who has played for Lamontville Golden Arrows, Chippa United, Thanda Royal Zulu, AmaZulu, Bidvest Wits and Swallows. He has 22 caps for Bafana Bafana. His lookalike, Elephant is a seasoned actor who has had roles in numerous television series including Wild at Heart, Heartlines, Generations, Zero Tolerance and Hillside. He is best known for his role as Turfloop Hospital boss Mr Kgomo on SAB 1 show Skeem Saam.
