BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic could lose a number of key players at the end of the season if they don’t act fast. Andile Fikizolo, Menzi Masuku and Tebogo Potsane’s contracts are expiring at the end of the season and there are no signs whether the club will retain them, or not. The club are yet to sit down with the respective players about their future prospects at the club. As things stand, the trio can sign a pre-contract with clubs of their choice. Fikizolo joined Celtic from Royal Eagles at the beginning of last season on a two-year deal while Masuku came from Mangaung-based side in the second half of the 2017-18 season after leaving Chippa United. The former Orlando Pirates winger scored the penalty this past weekend as Celtic beat TS Galaxy 2-1 to end their five game winless streak. Potsane joined in the second half of 2018/19 season after leaving Celtic’s provincial rivals Free State Stars. There’s also uncertainty over the future of Given Mashikinya and Lucky Baloyi. Both players saw their one-year options exercised before this season got underway, which was confirmed by their agent Jazzman Mahlakgane to SunSport. “Fikizolo, Masuku and Potsane are worried about their future at Celtic and can sign a pre-contract with any club right now. “They want to know what is the club’s intention as they have received offers elsewhere.” said an insider. This is not the only concern Celtic are facing, according to another source, who alleged: “The coaches have not been paid their March salaries but the players were.” The third informant adds that some players had not received their signing-on fees: “If the players don’t receive their signing-on fees, they won’t appear in the game against Golden Arrows (in Durban) on Sunday because they are supposed have (the signing-on fees) paid this week.” Celtic recently renewed the contract of goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane and that of defender Thato Lingwati.
