The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development in Nigeria, Alhaji Mohammed Sabo Nanono, has reportedly married an 18-year-old girl. The minister, who is 74-year-old reportedly, tied the knot with the young woman in a secret wedding held on Saturday, 3 April. According to Sahara Reporters, only three minister representatives attended the ceremony and the young bride has already settled in his home in Kano. “The minister only assigned three people and warned them against disclosing the details of his marriage to people,” a source told the publication Daily Nigerian. The source said Nanono’s family had kicked against the wedding, but the minister insisted on marrying the girl despite the over 50 years age gap. “The minister is madly in love. He appeared unstoppable,” the source added.
