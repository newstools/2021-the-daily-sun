SUPERSPORT United extended their winless run in the DStv Premiership to eight matches after being held to a 1-1 draw by relegation-haunted Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday afternoon. First-half goals by Sipho Mbule and Ovidy Karuru saw the two sides sharing the spoils in a match that was crucial for both sides. The result sees SuperSport keeping their sixth spot in the log standings while Lidoda Duvha remains at the foot of the table with 15 points after 22 matches.Leopards are now two points behind Chippa United and the relegation playoff berth. Leopards should have the lead in the third minute when a mistake in defence from United's Luke Fleurs allowed Ovidy Karuru to run in on goal, but goalkeeper George Chigova was on his toes to keep his side in the match. Leopards were made to pay for their early misses when United claimed the lead in the 18th minute: a slick passing move ended with Mbule skipping past a challenge on the edge of the box before neatly tucking home a shot to put the visitors ahead. Lidoda Duvha managed to get an equaliser 10 minutes later to level the game through Karuru. SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo said they would take positives from this match. He said: "We started very well, good combination, especially in the midfield. We had few opportunities in the first half, and if we could have taken them, probably the game would have been more different. "We scored a good goal. The goal which we conceded I believe we could have done better. Nevertheless, I am quite happy with the overall performance.” Tembo concluded: "Happy that Bradley (Grobler) got about 15 minutes. He is not yet fit. “Tuesday against Swallows will be a tough game; they are a team that has been doing well. I think we can only grow in confidence and take the positivity's to our next game that would be very important."
