MZANSI motorists can expect a breather next month. This as international petroleum market stability and a stronger exchange rate have given fuel prices a breather. The Automobile Association (AA) was commenting on unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. The current data showed the prospect of a welcome 32c/L drop in the price of diesel, and 27 cents for illuminating paraffin. “Petrol hasn’t fared as well, with a slight increase of 6c/L predicted,” the AA said. “However, the exchange rate’s performance is coming very close to nudging petrol into a decline. And if the current trends continue, there may be across-the-board relief from the recent series of price hikes at month-end.” The association said the rand had continued on the strengthening trend that emerged in mid-March, and had gained almost 50 cents against the US dollar since then. “Meanwhile, international petroleum prices have been stable over the same period, allowing the rand to leverage its recent strength.” The AA has reiterated its comments to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy, in which it called for a review of both the fuel price structure and taxes.
