THEY robbed a bread delivery truck and ended up being Good Samaritans to residents. It’s alleged the armed suspects robbed a bread delivery man in the Amaoti area in Inanda, north of Durban, on Friday 23 April. According to Reaction Unit of South Africa spokesman Prem Balram, the robbers stole 240 loaves of bread which they distributed to residents and passersby. Balram said this happened after they failed to open the safe in a Hyundai H100 bakkie during a robbery. "The owner of the bread distribution company contacted Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA), requesting assistance to locate his driver who was taken with the bakkie. The tracker confirmed that signals from the vehicle were emitting in Amaoti. RUSA officers and the SAPS converged on the area and recovered the vehicle," said Balram. He said the driver was not injured. "He explained that while delivering bread in the area, a white Toyota Avanza drove up to him and his assistant. One suspect produced a firearm and forced him to get into the vehicle and drive to an alternate location. The assistant managed to flee and contacted his employer," said Balram. He said the suspects accessed the back of the bakkie but were unable to open the safe. "They then forced the driver to offload 24 bread crates packed with 240 loaves of bread. The robbers distributed the bread to pedestrians and residents, informing them that Christmas had come early. After they have finished, they then drove off in the Toyota Avanza," said Balram. KZN police spokeswoman, Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of armed robbery is being investigated by Inanda SAPS.  "It is alleged by the complainant that on Friday he was delivering bread and other items with his crew at Ngoqokazi area in Inanda when they were attacked by unknown men. At gunpoint they demanded money and a safe and no money was found. They forced the victim to off-load bread and they were forced to leave. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated," said Gwala.
