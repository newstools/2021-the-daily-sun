A couple took Mzansi by storm in 2019 at a KFC restaurant when the man proposed to his woman. Their video trended and it united Mzansi. Many people including organizations assisted the couple in making sure that their wedding happened and that it was a wedding of the century. Another couple has graced us with their presence at the very same food chain restaurant, though it is not known yet which branch is it However, this couple got Mzansi divided. Unlike the last KFC couple, there is no love displayed in their video. All that's there are hot klaps. The woman is seen klapping the man in the face very hard. It seems like the couple was at the restaurant to buy food when the man told the woman there was no money. The woman demanded that he takes out the money and pay as she knows for sure that he's got some money. When the man emphasized that he doesn't have money, he got a chisa mpama. Before he could say much, he got another one, a very hot one. In the video, the man is seen giving his face to a woman to hit as much as she likes. The woman then leaves. People got divided, with some saying men were also victims of GBV. Some said the man was supposed to make things simple and pay the bill. It is not clear when the incident happened.
