TV presenter Kamohelo Bombe has scored herself a new presenting gig. The media personality, best known for presenting SABC1’s educational show Shift, has joined SABC2’s agricultural show Living Land, which returns in May. Kamohelo told Daily Sun: “Since the start of my career, Living Land has been one of the shows I’ve been wanting to present due to my love for farming. I must say it’s been a joyride because I’m learning a lot. “I’m being introduced to things that I never thought existed in the field of farming, such as using an app to farm.” The Limpopo-born presenter said the new season of Living Land will focus on the next generation and their role in agriculture, rural development and food security. “I’m really excited for the show to hit the screens because it’s going to give people another perspective about agriculture.” ALSO READ | SAFTA TO ANNOUNCE NOMINEES ON THURSDAY Kamo, as she’s affectionately known, comes from a farming background.

I realised there are fewer black people. “It’s about time we took up the space.”
