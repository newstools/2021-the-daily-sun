The right to proper healthcare for all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status, is enshrined in the Constitution. Those who prefer to go the African traditional route are permitted by the Constitution to do so. It’s wrong of employers to impose medical aids on employees and label them as benefits. The naked truth is that although employers subsidise it, a medical aid is not a benefit. Employees also have to pay for it. Another practice I find unethical is that of most employers partnering with specific medical aid service providers to force employees to subscribe to certain medical aid schemes. Medical aids are only applicable in private hospitals and practices. Enriching prescribed service providers in the name of healthcare, at the expense of the working class, is the height of exploitation. - Letter by Malphia Honwane, Gottenburg, eManyeleti
