CONTROVERSIAL Setsoto Mayor Komane Koalane was removed on Wednesday, 14 April following the motion of no confidence tabled by the United Front of Civics. Koalane was removed through a secret ballot. At a meeting, 15 councillors voted Koalane out, while 14 tried unsuccessfully to protect him. According to United Front of Civics caucus leader Patrick Matsau, Koalane’s poor leadership skills led to the collapse of the municipality’s service delivery and finance. “The mayor is renting expensive cars without taking into consideration the financial situation of the municipalities and appointed a service provider to make a billboard which displays his face without following proper processes. Apparently the mayor was good for wrong reasons. He spent more than R500 000 on car rentals and R198 000 on the billboard,” he claimed. Last month, the Free State municipality was slammed by members of the public accounts and finance committee in Legislature due to its failure to fill strategic positions like municipal manager and chief financial officer. Koalane came after Nthateng Maoke, who resigned in December 2019 after controversy about her citizenship. Koalane told Daily Sun before the council meeting all the allegations against him were politically motivated. “Since 2016, our cash flow was never good,” he said. Koalane was the second mayor removed by a vote of no confidence in the province after Olly Mlamleli from Mangaung Metro. Three councillors allegedly voted with opposition parties. ANC councillors left the council chamber immediately after being defeated by the opposition. Deputy ANC regional task team convener Tumelo Thebe said: “We are disappointed by what transpired in Setsoto Municipality where our councillors joined forces to remove our deployee. However, we will embark in thorough investigations to get to the bottom of the matter.” The executive mayor’s position is now vacant.
