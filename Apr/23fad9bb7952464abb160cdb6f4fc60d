MARITZBURG United missed a big chance to pull away from the relegation zone. This after the Team of Choice let their lead slip against Baroka FC to play to a 1-1 draw at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday night. If Maritzburg were able to hang on to the win after Thabiso Kutumela scored against his former club in the 25th minute, his 10th league goal this season would have gone to 23 points. However, Maritzburg went to sleep, and towering striker Evidence Makgopa punished them as he equalized for Baroka in the ninth minute later. But Makgopa’s goal, the national under-23 striker, appeared to be offside, and the referee was let down by his first assistant, who should have flagged for offside as he was on the near side of the action. While that was the main talking point, the home side had the lion share of position in the first half, but they couldn’t make more telling efforts about it. Then things swung in favour of Baroka in the second half, despite finishing with ten men after captain Ananias Gebhardt was sent off in the 83rd minute. Baroka will be delighted with this point as two trips away from Limpopo saw them pick up four points out of six after beating struggling Chippa United in their previous game. Even coach Matsimela Thoka after the match, was delighted by the return of points. With this draw, the visitors also kept their top eight spot hunt intact as they moved to 28 points from 24 matches. They looked destined to finish in the top half, which will be for the first time in the club’s history. For Maritzburg, the draw didn’t help them much. The Midlands club remained 13th on the log table with 21 points after 22 games. Ernst Middendorp’s side are two points ahead of 14th placed Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), four points ahead of 15th placed Chippa and seven ahead of bottom side Black Leopards.
