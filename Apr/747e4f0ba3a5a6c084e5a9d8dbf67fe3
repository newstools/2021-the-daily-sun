CAPE Town City will go in search of a hat-trick of 2020-21 DStv Premiership wins when they host Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday (5pm). On Wednesday, The Citizens claimed a second successive win when they defeated Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 at FNB Stadium. Head coach Jan Olde Riekerink underlined the importance of the midweek win at Chiefs in City's continued hopes of reaching their league target for the season and claiming a top eight finish. “If you have any ambition to achieve something this season, then this was a crucial game," Riekerink said after defeating Chiefs. "That’s what I said before the game, if we’d lost the distance to the position we want to be in would have become too big. We needed the full points today (versus Chiefs). “I know it was not fair to ask the group for the full points because they always struggle against Chiefs but they also knew that if they really want to achieve something this season, then we had to win this game.” City are in position seven in the log with 33 points after 23 outings. On the other end, Tshakhuma are in relegation zone occupying the 14th spot with 19 ponits after 21 matches. They will be hoping for maximum points in this match to try and pull out of the relegation zone. “We haven’t won anything and we are still down there in the relegation zone in the league," said TTM's coach Mpho Maleka following TTM's historic win where they defeated Mamelodi Sundowns to reach Nedbank Cup final. "The most important thing for us is to keep our feet on the ground because we have important matches in the league and in the cup final. We are going to fight in those remaining nine matches in the league to save this team." Earky this season the two sides played to a thrilling 2-2 at Thohoyandou Stadium.
