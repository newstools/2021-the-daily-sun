AMAZULU president Sandile Zungu does not want to entertain calls from the country’s masses who want his coach Benni McCarthy to be the next Bafana Bafana mentor. Zungu said he will not comment on the issue. “My response to that question is it’s entirely hypothetical and speculative,” said Zungu when asked if he would allow McCarthy to leave his club to coach Bafana. “I can’t entertain it. That’s all I can say for now.” There have been growing calls for McCarthy, the all-time Bafana top scorer with 31 goals from 80 games, to be appointed as the new Bafana coach. The former Orlando Pirates striker has markedly improved AmaZulu’s form since his arrival last December. Since McCarthy walked through the door, AmaZulu have picked up 31 points, more than any other DStv Premiership side. This hasn’t gone unnoticed. The PSL recently awarded him with the Coach of the Month gong for March. The Durban-based club are currently lying third on the table with 37 points from 21 games, level with third-placed Golden Arrows – with the latter having a better goal difference. In addition, AmaZulu have become the first side to have won five consecutive league matches in the top flight this season. Clearly, Zungu will not want to lose McCarthy to Safa as his team is heading in the right direction. Safa are in the hunt for a new national coach after parting ways with Molefi Ntseki last week. This follows Bafana’s failure to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations finals to be held in Cameroon next year. This is not the first time McCarthy has been linked with the Bafana post. Even before Safa decided to hand Ntseki the job in August 2019 to replace Stuart Baxter, McCarthy, then in charge of Cape Town City, was touted to replace Baxter. The technical committee, Safa’s body that head hunts and recommends new Bafana coaches to the National Executive Committee, held its first meeting yesterday with the view to hiring a new national squad coach.
