AFTER 10 years of trying and billions spent to make it possible, Manchester City are closer to winning the Champions League than they have ever been. A come-from-behind 2-1 win away to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday has put Pep Guardiola's side in sight of the final. The threat posed by PSG's star duo Neymar and Kylian Mbappe remains ahead of Tuesday's semi-final, second leg in Manchester, but City appear to have learned from many years of harsh lessons in Europe's premier club competition. A clash between the French champions and soon-to-be-crowned Premier League winners was also a proxy battle between Qatar-owned PSG and Abu Dhabi-backed City. Despite changing the face of European football with their investment in the transfer market over the past decade, both clubs are still waiting for the ultimate glory of winning the Champions League. PSG came closest when they lost last season's final 1-0 to Bayern Munich. Having this time seen off the German giants in the quarter-finals, Mauricio Pochettino's men started like a team determined to go one better this year. Captain Marquinhos powered home Angel di Maria's corner on 15 minutes in a blistering start by the hosts. In Guardiola's first four seasons in charge of City, setbacks in Champions League knockout ties have often deteriorated into collapses. Monaco, Liverpool, Tottenham and Lyon all scored multiple times in quick succession to oust City before the semi-final stage. But crucially, there was no repeat of that this time as Champions League's meanest defence kept PSG at bay until after the break. -AFP
