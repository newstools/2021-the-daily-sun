WHAT do Facebook and the South African borders have in common? Besides an overflow of people, both parties have systems that can be easily breached. This past weekend, cybersecurity experts revealed that about half a billion Facebook users’ personal information was breached. A “treasure trove” of data including full names, birthdays, phone numbers and locations were breached by hackers. Facebook said the massive leak, which stemmed from an issue in 2019, has since been fixed. However, the weekend’s breach saw more than 30 million accounts in the USA being affected. But Facebook isn’t making it easy to find out if your data was included in the breach. A third party website called haveibeenpwned.com has made it simple to check if your account was breached by inputting your email. The company temporarily checks if your email was among those stolen. According to the statistics, 533 million Facebook accounts were included in the breach and only 2,5 million of those included emails in the stolen data. HaveIBeenPwned creator and security expert Troy Hunt said on Twitter he’s examining whether to add phone numbers. “The primary value of the data is the association of phone numbers to identities. While each record included phone, only 2,5 million contained an email address,” Hunt’s website said.
