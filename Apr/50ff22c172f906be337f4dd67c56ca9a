THE City of Cape Town mayor, Dan Plato, says the Mother City is gearing up to welcome teams from all over the world to the Netball World Cup in the city in 2023. “South Africa’s economy has taken a knock as a result of the Covid-19 virus,” said Plato. “Hosting the Netball World Cup will boost the hotel sector and the tourism sector. “The Netball World Cup 2023 will give new energy to these sectors and stimulate the economy as a whole. It will also create employment opportunities throughout South Africa.” Plato said the Spar Challenge Tri-nations series involving South Africa, Uganda and Namibia, which is currently underway in Cape Town, was an important part of the preparations for the Netball World Cup. “We are happy to host other African nations, and show the world that South Africa is firmly behind netball.” He called on the people of Cape Town and of South Africa as a whole to support the Netball World Cup. Last week, at the opening of the Spar Challenge International Tri-Nations, deputy sports minister Nocawe Mafu said government had approved the budget for the 2023 Netball World Cup. The Tri-nations continues at the Cape Town International Conference Centre until tomorrow.
