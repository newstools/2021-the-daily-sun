A 17-YEAR-OLD boy killed himself after a quarrel with his girlfriend. The unfortunate incident happened in Hammanskraal at the Domanican School for the Deaf on Wednesday, 31 March. According to Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona, the pupil hung himself after a love quarrel with a 17-year-old girl pupil from the same school. “The boy had allegedly left other pupils at the dining hall and went to the junior hostel, where he took his life,” he said. Mabona said his body was found by fellow pupils, who allegedly untied him and let him down before calling for help. Paramedics arrived within 10 minutes, but he was declared dead on the scene. “It’s very unfortunate that a pupil took his life. This is a very sensitive issue to which we firstly wish to convey our deepest condolences to the family of the pupil. We also wish to convey our sympathy to the school population for this loss,” said Mabona. Meanwhile, teachers and pupils were in shock after a matric pupil lost her life due to breathing complications at a school in Soweto. According to Mabona, the 18-year-old pupil was from Sekanontoane Secondary School in Senaoane, Soweto. Mabona said the incident happened on Wednesday morning, 31 March shortly after school started. “Information at our disposal states that this unfortunate incident occurred at about 7.45am. The pupil allegedly arrived at school and attended her class that morning, but she suddenly ran out of the class rushing to the water tap while struggling to breath,” said Mabona. He said MEC Panyaza Lesufi is very saddened by the death of this pupil. Mabona said social workers had been sent to the schools to provide counselling to affected pupils and teachers.
