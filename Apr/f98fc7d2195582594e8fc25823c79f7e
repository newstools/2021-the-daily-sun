THE Road Accident Fund (RAF) requires us to find creative ways to ensure the taxpayer receives value on the investment they make through the fuel levy. These were the words of Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula while virtually addressing RAF board members on Saturday, 17 April. He said a week ago, the Pretoria High Court handed down a judgment that suspended all writ of execution and attachments against the RAF based on court orders already granted or settlements already reached in terms of the RAF Act until 30 April, while those that are not older than 180 days are suspended from 1 May until 12 September. “In welcoming this judgment, I reflected that this was a step in the right direction in our efforts to ensure those who fall victim to accidents on our roads continue to benefit from the social security net RAF provides.” Mbalula said the RAF board, which was appointed in December 2019, has been hard at work bringing RAF back from the brink of collapse. He said they were under no illusion about the magnitude of the challenges RAF faced and the task at hand. “If we are to make decisive interventions towards a sustainable model that continues to protect the livelihoods of those left destitute as a result of road accidents, we need to find creative ways to ensure taxpayers receive value without abdicating our responsibility to provide a social security net to those affected by road accidents,” he said. The minister said that there was no connection between the fuel levy and the number of accidents that occur on public roads. “The challenge of the ever-increasing administrative costs of the RAF scheme must be addressed in order to stop the haemorrhaging of the fund.” Mbalula said that they have concluded that bringing RAF back to financial stability would require both a regulatory overhaul and an operational improvement.
