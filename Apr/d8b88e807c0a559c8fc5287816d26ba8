SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo feel his side deserved something in their DStv Premiership match against Golden Arrows on Wednesday afternoon. Matsatsantsa A Pitori suffered a 1-0 defeat against Golden Arrows at Lucas Moripe Stadium.Â Nduduzo Sibiya scored the only goal of the match that saw Arrows leapfrogging AmaZulu to a second spot in the log standings with 41 points, six behind log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. Tembo said he was satisfied with the improved performance. However, the lack of killer instinct let them down. He said: "Huge improvement from our previous game. I thought we played well, dominated the position got into good areas, but we could not find the back of the net. "I think George (Chigova) had only one thing to do, pick up the ball in the net during the first half and after that he had nothing to do. It shows how we dominated the game. But at the same time if you don't take your chances you won't win the matches and I think we deserved something out of this game but never the less we take the positives and move." Tembo gave a rare start to Jesse Donn, and he was impressed by the youngsters' display. "We have very good technical players we try to put them all in the field and today (Wednesday) they showed quality I'm happy with the Jesse Donn's position his grabbing the chance with both hands, even Jammie (Webber) did well," Tembo added. "He was playing more inside I was quite happy with his performance. We just have to be positive to get away out of this." SuperSport next game, on Saturday (3pm), they will face relegation Haunted Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium in Venda. Tembo said: "It's also a huge test for us to play a team that has also not been doing well we just have to go there with positive mind to play to win."
