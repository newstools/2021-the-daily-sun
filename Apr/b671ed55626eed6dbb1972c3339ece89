ANOTHER day, another disappointment for the Proteas. The South African national cricket side cannot seem to find a way past the tunnel they have been stuck in for three years now. A spectacular century by Babar Azam helped Pakistan thump the Proteas by nine wickets and secure a 2-1 lead in their four-match T20 International Series at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Wednesday. The visiting captain struck 122 off just 59 balls (15 fours, 4 sixes) and shared in a record 197-run opening partnership with vice-captain Mohammad Rizwan, who ended unbeaten on 73 off 47 balls (5 fours, 2 sixes), as the tourists chased down 204 with two overs to spare. The Proteas bowlers were then humbled by the incredible Babar and Rizwan as they attacked relentlessly.Â Babar then went on to score his maiden century, before progressing that to the highest individual T20I score ever by a Pakistani. He was finally taken out by Lizaad Williams (1/34) with seven to get, before Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman (eight) carried their side home with 12 balls to spare. The Proteas seems to be going nowhere slowly.
