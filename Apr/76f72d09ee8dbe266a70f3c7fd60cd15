LAWYERS representing former president Jacob Zuma have withdrawn. In a letter sent to the High Court in Pietermaritzburg, KZN yesterday, his legal representative Eric Mabuza said they would no longer represent Zuma. “Be pleased to take note that Mabuza Attorneys hereby withdraw as attorneys on record for accused no 1,” read the letter. This happened three weeks before the start of his fraud, money laundering and corruption trial set for 17 May. Zuma allegedly received an annual bribe of R500 000 from French arms dealer Thales, for political protection from an investigation into the controversial arms deal in the 1990s. The alleged bribe was facilitated by his former financial adviser Schabir Shaik. Mabuza did not give reasons for their decision to withdraw their services. The withdrawal happens a week after the Supreme Court of Appeal dealt Zuma a blow when it ruled that he must pay from his own pocket for his corruption trial legal costs, and ordered him to pay back R25 million already incurred during the legal proceedings. NPA spokesman Sipho Ngwema said it was ready to go ahead with the case as planned. Zuma is awaiting sentence from the Constitutional Court for contempt of court. The court ordered the former president to comply with the Zondo Commission summons in January. On 1 February, Zuma issued a statement accusing the court’s decision to order him to appear before the commission as effectively stripping him of his constitutional right as a citizen. He disobeyed the order. Commission lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi submitted that Zuma must go to the Zondo Commission in orange overalls. He said there was no fitting punishment for the former president’s decision to disobey the court order that instructed him to appear before the commission than direct imprisonment.
