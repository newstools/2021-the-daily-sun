Cops bust three men and recovered firearms in an attempted cash heist incident that left a cop and security guard wounded. The three were arrested in Khayamandi kasi in Stellenbosch just outside Cape  Town. Cops national spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said cops managed to recover five firearms including three AK-47 rifles and five vehicles after they cornered the thugs. The thugs attempted to rob a cash van in Macassar near Khayelitsha but the quick reaction by cops foiled the plan. They then fled the scene but they had injured a security guard. A policeman was also injured during a fire exchange when the thugs were escaping cops. “A group of armed men attacked a CIT vehicle in Macassar and wounded a security guard in an attempt to rob the cash-in-transit vehicle. Police reinforcements comprising of local police, TRT and air support responded immediately foiling the robbery but a chase and a shootout ensued creating multiple scenes between Macassar, Mfuleni and Stellenbosch in which a 39 year Sergeant from the SAPS was wounded,” said Naidoo.  He said the suspects fled to Khayamandi in Stellenbosch where cops tracked and bust three of them and recovered firearms. “Three suspects were arrested and five firearms including three AK-47 rifles, as well as five vehicles, were seized in Stellenbosch. Two of the vehicles were hijacked by the suspects as they fled the Macassar scene,” said Naidoo. Two weeks ago on 14 April, a cash van was bombed in Gugulethu where a security guard was killed. The security company SBV announced an R1 million reward for anyone with information that leads to the arrest and prosecution of the robbers.
