TODAY marks six years since the passing of Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs legend John “Shoes” Moshoeu. Moshoeu was one of the greatest players ever to be produced by Mzansi, with a career spanning 27 years. He also spent 10 years in Turkey where he played for four teams, including Fenerbahce, before returning home to rejoin Amakhosi in 2003. The midfield lost his battle with cancer sadly passed away on this day in 2015. “Shoes” played for Giant Blackpool before joining Kaizer Chiefs back in 1993. He was also part of a Bafana team that clinched the country’s only Africa Cup of Nations title in 1996 to date, winning 73 international caps.
