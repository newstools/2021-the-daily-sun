Recent studies have shown that South African roads are among the most dangerous in the world. With so many accidents during normal days on our roads, one can always fear the worst during the Easter long weekend. Reckless drivers show their true colours during congested traffic. We have many fatal accidents on our roads because some drivers are impatient. It’s not difficult to apply traffic rules and respect fellow road users if you consider everyone’s safety. Some drivers violate simple rules of the road, thinking their vehicles know them. No vehicle can drive itself safely, no matter how luxurious or expensive it is. It is painful to obey the rules of the road, only to get involved in an accident because of someone who breaks them. We need to ensure that we are mentally and physically fit whenever we are behind the wheel. That and being sober-minded will help us stay alert at all times. Let us drive safely this Easter weekend and beyond. Ignoring road signs and markings equals to gambling with your life and those of other road users. - Letter by Abigail Ledubuko, Bochum
