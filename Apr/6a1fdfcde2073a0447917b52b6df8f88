BAFANA Bafana midfielder Thabo Nodada believes Molefi Ntseki was the right man for the Bafana Bafana job. The diminutive midfielder was part of the Bafana squad that failed to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations after suffering a 2-0 defeat against Sudan. Nodada says Ntseki should have been given more time. “I wish Molefi Ntseki had another chance,” Nodada told The Cosafa media. “Him being a teacher meant a lot in that national team, to be able to process so much information in just seven or eight days. He was so detailed in how the team should play and how the set-up should be. “I do not think there was any player who went onto that field not knowing what to do. It is just that when you cross the line, it is not the coach. It is you and your readiness. “I had prepared a note when I was going to the national team. I was going to thank the coach for everything, he took me and planted me on very fertile land. He gave me the chance to play in the national team over the last 12 months. "Even when things weren’t going well at my club, he had the courage to call me back to the national team.” Nodada said it was disappointing not to get a chance to play when Bafana was denied a spot to the Afcon by Sudan. He stated: “In the latter stages of the camp in Sudan I thought I came into my own and I was very disappointed I didn’t get the chance to play. I felt I was just one kick away from doing something I have not even thought about.”
