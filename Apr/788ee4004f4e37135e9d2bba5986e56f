FORMER Bloemfontein Celtic boss Charley Pietersen has lost his wedding ring and other jewellery. Thugs used a crowbar to break into his house in Centurion, Tshwane, on Sunday at about 3am. Pietersen, now the founder of Growing Up Without A Father, said he also lost electronics, takkies and money. He told Daily Sun the two robbers, who spoke English and Shona, were carrying guns. They broke his son’s bedroom window with a crowbar. PSL PLAYER'S 4-5 EXPOSED! “I suspect they used something to make us sleep as we didn’t hear anything. “There was a terrible bad smell in the house while they were there. “As I came from the toilet I saw a gun at my head.” He said they ordered him to lie down and asked him where the money, rings and cellphones were. The thugs then stole his wife’s handbag, two laptops, a wallet with bank cards, licence and R4 500 he was supposed to use to pay for the event he’d hosted on Saturday.  They also took a plasma TV, Playstation 4, five cellphones, perfumes, five pairs of his son’s takkies and one pair he was given by former Bafana Bafana striker, Shaun Bartlett. Pietersen suspects the thugs, who were wearing balaclavas, were using a getaway car waiting for them in the street. “The family is still traumatised,” he said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: “A case of housebreaking was opened, and no one has been arrested yet.”
