MALAWI captain and AmaZulu defender Limbikani Mzava brought tears to his mother by surprising her with a car. This after Mzava helped the Flames beat Uganda’s Cranes to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Cameroon next year. The former Golden Arrows defender was part of the side as Baroka striker Richard Mbulu scored the only goal of the game against Uganda at Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre on 29 March. Other familiar names in the side were Mbulu’s teammate Gerald Phiri Junior, Orlando Pirates striker Gabadinho Mhango. This was a welcome return for Mzava, as he has been missed in the national team for the past three years, to help Malawi qualify for the Afcon finals since 2010. This will be Malawi’s third appearance in the Afcon finals participating in 1984’s event. In all their past two participations, Malawi has never progressed beyond the group stages. After the win in Kamuzu Stadium, scenes of jubilant fans in Blantyre were seen, blowing vuvuzelas and also hooting cars loudly to celebrate the historical occasion for the national team. While Mzava witnessed all that, he thought it was good to surprise his mother with a Nissan Tida. When she saw the car, Mzava’s mother was in tears and the defender just stood near her as she was in state of disbelief. To qualify for the 24-team tournament, Malawi joined nations such as Cameroon (hosts), Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde Islands, Comoros Islands, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. The last qualifying team (Benin or Sierra Leone) will be determined in June. The Afcon finals draw will take place on 25 June.
