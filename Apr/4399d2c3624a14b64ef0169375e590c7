ANC treasurer-general Paul Mashatile has downplayed reports
of a planned national shutdown in protest of the ANC National Executive
Committee's (NEC) step-aside policy which would force party secretary-general
Ace Magashule to vacate office by month-end. Speaking at the national commemoration of Solomon Mahlangu
in Tshwane on Tuesday, Mashatile said the party didn't have evidence of any
meetings planning the purported nationwide shutdown. The treasurer-general told the media that anybody planning a
shutdown would be doing so out of bad faith and going against the
organisation's constitution. "For now, we're not concerned about that. We think the
processes we put in place are unfolding in a way that we think is fair; in a
way that we believe once we conclude those processes, nobody will complain that
they've been treated unfairly," Mashatile said. City Press reported that the supporters of the under-fire
Magashule and former president Jacob Zuma were planning a series of national
protests around the country. The paper also reported that the shutdown would coincide
with the 30-day deadline given to Magashule to step aside from his position
given the criminal charges he faces. Mashatile said ANC members, including those currently in the
spotlight for wrongdoing, displayed "discipline". "There's a lot of discipline in the ANC and cadres of
the ANC know that things must be done in a proper way," Mashatile said. The alleged move by the so-called "radical economic
transformation forces" comes after the NEC took a decision that Magashule
and other leaders criminally charged, should step down within the stipulated
30-days or face suspension. Magashule is currently out on R200 000 bail and faces
corruption charges relating to the Free State asbestos matter. SOURCE: NEWS24
