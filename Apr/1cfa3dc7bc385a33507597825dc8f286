THERE was confusion after rapper Big Zulu cancelled his birthday celebration at the last minute. The show was scheduled to take place on Saturday night at Legacy Lifestyle Lounge in Nyamazaneni, Mpumalanga. Mpho Less was announced as the host of the event. But there was a huge disappointment after Big Zulu cancelled the show just a few minutes before it was supposed to start. Taking to his Facebook page, he wrote: “I am no longer coming to this event. It’s not my fault but the event organiser’s fault. I’m so sorry for this.” The message was accompanied by a poster with a cancelled sign across it. His fans were angry, saying they had already bought tickets. But a few hours later he changed his mind and announced he was going to attend his birthday celebration.

Are you coming or not?” While Mnqobi Msomi wrote: “Now you are playing games with us.” Daily Sun approached Big Zulu and he said there was a communication break down between himself and the event organisers. “It’s true that I’d already cancelled the event but after communicating with the event organisers, I decided to continue with my birthday celebration. I’d therefore like to take this opportunity to apologise for all the confusion that was created,” he said.
