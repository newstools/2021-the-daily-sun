WHEN it comes to analysing opponents, very few are as thorough as Rulani Mokwena. The Mamelodi Sundowns co-coach has been like a “fly in the wall”, snooping in the Orlando Pirates dressing room ahead of their Nedbank Cup quarterfinal blockbuster at Loftus Stadium on Thursday (6pm). Mokwena spent two years as part of the Bucs technical team and he knows a thing or two about Josef Zinnbauer’s planning. “I can give you the Pirates line-up. We all know more or less who will play except for the conundrum from the good performance in their 3-0 win over Ahli Benghazi of Libya where Tshegofatso Mabasa and Kabelo Dlamini played‚” said Rhulani Mokwena. “That is possibly their biggest conundrum‚ but you know there are possibilities of Siphesihle Ndlovu or Ntsikelelo Nyauza playing at right-back. With Nyauza‚ it is more of a back three than it is a back four because with Ndlovu there is a lot more adventure and forays offensively. “It will possibly be Happy Jele‚ Thulani Hlastshwayo‚ Paseka Mako and if Nyauza is not playing centre half‚ he is playing right back. “In the midfield, there is Thabang Monare and Ben Motshwari at central midfield‚ Fortune Makaringe as their number ten and there is also Vincent Pule in that space. “Then there are the remaining positions for the likes of Gabadinho Mhango‚ Deon Hotto‚ Kabelo Dlamini or even Linda Mntambo. So‚ we know more or less the Pirates line-up and fortunately, we are also clued up on some of their schemes.” Like many, Mokwena sees the epic encounter as the “final before the final”, one of the two sides seen as favourites to reach the final and possibly winning the KeYona tournament. “With due respect to all the remaining sides and the teams that participated in the competition‚, I think this is the final before the final. Two very good team's,” said Mokwena.
