BUGATTI is building just 60 examples of the Chiron Pur Sport and unfortunately, one of those rare examples was recently involved in a crash. News of the crash surfaced on social media showing a two-tone black and grey Chiron Pur Sport parked on the side of the road together with a Toyota Corolla resting on a patch of grass. It then quickly emerged that the Chiron Pur Sport in question is a demo car that was also being driven and reviewed by journalists in recent weeks. According to Carscoops, the rare French hypercar was on a test drive at the time and while neither Bugatti itself nor the dealer commented on the incident, an Instagram user claims to know exactly what happened.  According to KRN Speed, the Chiron Pur Sport is said to have hit the Toyota from behind and the incident appears to have happened on either 1 April or 2 April. It’s claimed that the driver of the Bugatti was speeding at the time of the incident. Interestingly, the hypercar appears largely free of damage in the video and photos but, according to KRN Speed, that’s not the case. The front end of the Chiron Pur Sport is said to have suffered damage to its precious carbon fibre valued at a figure that remains unconfirmed. Damage sustained to the Corolla appears limited to a large dent on the rear bumper.
