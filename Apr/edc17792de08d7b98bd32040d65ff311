DIVORCE parties are the in thing at the moment. This is not seen often in Mzansi, but a few people have been talking about it. Now images of a divorcee are going around on social media and some people are happy to see that people celebrate their divorces as much as they celebrated their weddings. After all the effort that people put into their wedding day, the day they formalise their divorce can often feel empty and awkward – on top of whatever emotions one might have about the end of a marriage. That’s why the divorce party has become quite the trend over the past few years. Nhlakanipho Njezedwa said the idea is simple: you celebrate your wedding as the start of a new part of your life with someone, so why not celebrate a divorce as another new beginning? “Some people think it’s like celebrating a death in the family, but a divorce is the best thing for all parties and can be a very positive thing as people grow and move on,” he said. Thando Mzikhali said: “Not everyone whose divorce got finalised is miserable. Some went through the most and are happy to be free.  “A friend of mine is going through the most with her divorce and we vowed we will go on a divorce celebration once everything is finalised. It’s really tough and exhausting,” she added. Some think people who throw divorce parties are bitter and should heal. “People who do such are never happy. They’re bitter! If he is really was happy, he would have kept low. He will die of depression. Someone must watch him closely,” said Steeve Styels. Adam Mavuso said this isn’t a sign of happiness. He sees a broken man trying to hide his hurting soul. “That moment when you are pretending to be happy, yet you know you are not. You just publish it to gain fame from people but unfortunately there is loneliness.”
