WHILE Maritzburg United missed a chance to pull away from teams at the bottom of the table, club coach Ernst Middendorp was left elated by his skipper Thabiso Kutumela’s scoring feat. The former Orlando Pirates striker scored his 10th league goal this season after netting in a 1-1 draw against his former club Baroka FC at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday. This is the first time Kutumela has scored ten in the PSL top flight, after scoring six last season.In the last eight matches in all competitions, Kutumela has scored eight goals. The Limpopo-born striker is one goal shy of second PSL goal scorer this season Ruzaigh Gamildien and three behind leading scorer Bradley Grobler. But Middendorp praised the player who is doing the hard work for Kutumela to score these goals. “I think Sanisa Hlongwane is creating spaces for the front guys with his cleverness, with his dribbling, receiving the ball in tight spaces and making something out of out,” said Middendorp.“ "And Kutu is the one who is capitalising on it. To have a forward who is scoring goals and being one of leading in the league, it is always a compliment for the player and for the club." But Middendorp was left frustrated by the way Baroka wasted time to slow the game down. Baroka goalie Oscarine Masuluke was eventually booked in the referee’s optional time after Evidence Makgopa scored an equaliser in what appeared the towering striker was in an offside position. The Limpopo side finished the game with ten men their skipper Ananias Gebhardt sent off in the 83rd minute. “A team like Baroka only had one interest but to slow it down and slow it down,” said Middendorp who was also left incensed with a man of the match award awarded to Joslin Kamatuka. “They wasted time, falling down and that is what they did mostly.”
