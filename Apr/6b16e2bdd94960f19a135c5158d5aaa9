BANYANA Banyana thrashed Zambia 3-1 without a core of overseas-based players in an international friendly match at the Bidvest Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Banyana came to the match with only three overseas-based players Noko Matlou, Thembi Kgatlana, and Amanda Mthandi. However, SD Eibar's connection of Noko Matlou and Thembi Kgatlana was enough to hand Desiree Ellis side a victory. Matlou scored a brace, and Kgatlana scored the third goal as Banyana came from 1-0 down to beat Zambia 3-1. This was Banyana's first match since winning Cosafa Cup last year November. It was also the first appearance in just over a year for Matlou and Kgatlana, as they last played for Banyana in November 2019 when they lost 2-0 to Japan. Zambia were the first to find the back of the net just under 17 minutes through their star striker Barbra Banda. But their lead was short-lived as Matlou leveled the matters in the 22nd minute. Matlou combined with Kgatlana in the 39th minute to complete her brace. Three minutes later, Kgatlana extended the lead to 3-1 when she rounded Zambia goalkeeper Ngambo Musole to pass the empty net. Banyana are now going to play against Botswana on Tuesday (3pm) at the same venue. Banyana are using these friendly matches to prepare for the upcoming Cosafa Championship tournament and the Africa Women's Cup of Nations (Awcon) qualifiers which will take place later this year. Having failed to qualify for this year's Tokyo Olympic Games, there is immense pressure for Banyana to qualify for the Awcon and finish within to top to qualify for the 2023 Fifa Women's World Cup.
