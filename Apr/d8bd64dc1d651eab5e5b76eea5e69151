A 26-year-old man has appeared in court in connection with the murder of a five-year-old Kuils River girl and the rape of her grandmother. On Saturday, at around 23:00, the girl was assaulted and her 55-year-old grandmother stabbed, in what police suspect was a "domestic dispute". "A a 26-year-old man was arrested on a charge of murder and attempted murder following an incident in Sylvia Street, Kalkfontein, where a five-year-old child was assaulted and a 55-year-old female was stabbed with a sharp instrument," said police spokesperson Colonel Andrè Traut. The child later died in hospital, added Traut. "The child succumbed to her injuries after being admitted to hospital, while the female is still being treated for her injuries. It is suspected that a domestic dispute sparked the attack on the two victims." The suspect made a brief appearance in the Blue Downs Magistrates Court on Tuesday.
