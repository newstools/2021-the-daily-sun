While other churches held their services
inside their church premises Kingdom Life Bible Church from Lower Crossroads in
Philippi East decided to do things differently, they walked and prayed in the
most dangerous streets in this area. Speaking to Daily Sun church member Phumla
Ndzuzo said they are bringing hope to the residents. “This area is one of the
dangerous places with high crime, by doing this we are pleading to God to hear
us, end crime and all the bad things that have been happening here”, said
Ndzuzo. She said they also wanted to restore hope in this dark time (Covid-19).
“We know that many people won’t have time to go to church, we are bringing it
to them”, added Ndzuzo. Apostle Linda Ndaba also the founder of the church said
Lower residents have lucky because there is still Kingdom Life Bible church
even though there is high crime. “You do not have to come out and sing or pray
to us, you can do it while sitting on your couches or inside your yard, the
important thing is to pray together”, added Ndaba. He said people have been
crying about the bad things happening in Lower Crossroads. “We will never stop
praying and asking God for forgiveness, we will pray for the criminals to
change their ways and I know that one day God will answer our prayers”, he
added. Luleka Sizani a 46-year-old resident appreciate what the church did.
“Some of us stopped going to church because they are asking for money we don’t
even have, we want God in our lives but our leaders in those churches have
other agendas”, said Sizani. She said she is now praying in her house.
"They reminded me of the church, and they must continue doing this even
after Easters, we need them", added Sizani. Another resident said they
need churches like Kingdom Life Bible Church. "They are giving us hope, we
are in a lot of stress because of Covid-19, the prayer they did will help a
lot", added the resident. He said even though he didn't go to church but
being amongst church members helped him.
