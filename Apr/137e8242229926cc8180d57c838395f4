ARTISTS Emtee and DJ Citi Lyts are the latest rappers to have a feud on Twitter streets. This after rapper and DJ Citi Lyts said Emtee didn’t thank him for the work he did for his debut single, Roll Up. The Vura hitmaker said he was responsible from the fashion to the launch, but Emtee never acknowledged that. The rappers were both signed to Ambitiouz Entertainment and collaborated on a number of songs while at the label. “Six years later! I hope one day, I’ll get a thank you for making this video possible – from the drip to the launch. Ninjaz forget easily,” the DJ wrote.
