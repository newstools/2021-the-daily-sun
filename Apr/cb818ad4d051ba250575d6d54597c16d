Robert Ng’ambi is a businessman. The former Black Leopards and Platinum Stars player has opened a sports apparel shop called Divine back home in Limbe, Malawi. “I am a sportsman and all I know is sports," he said. "Sports fans know that all that I know is the game,” said the 34-year-old former midfielder. “It is a good business because sport is huge all over the world. So I felt is was about time I open a shop at home (Malawi). So far the shop is doing well.” Ng’ambi also revealed that he also plans on owning another sports shop in Joburg. ”I travel all the time between Malawi and South Africa,” he said. “You need to have something to fall back on after playing football. It is not all retired players who will become coaches. I have been planning for this with my family before I retired. I was in South Africa two weeks ago to check on the business.”  Ng’ambi spent 20 years playing professional football in the top flight. The Malawian international signed for Leopards in 2005 from Zimbabwean outfit Monomotapa. He spent six years with Lidoda Duvha before joining Platinum Stars. He then enjoyed seven years at the now-defunct North West side before returning to Leopards in 2019. Ng’ambi retired at Leopards at the end of last season after helping Leopards avoid relegation through the promotion/relegation playoffs. On Leopards struggle in their DStv Premiership campaign, Ng’ambi said: “If there is any team that I love in South Africa it is Black Leopards. I also love Venda and the people.  I am sure Leopards will avoid the drop. They have been in that situation before. I pray every day that they won’t go down.”
