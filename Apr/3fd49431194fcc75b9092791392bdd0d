POLICE in Mpumalanga are searching for three suspects who escaped from the holding cells at Kriel Police Station early this morning. Siyabonga Mlotshwa (18), Thabo Motaung (24) and Njabulo Khoza (35) were initially arrested for rape, robbery, possession of drugs, housebreaking, theft, as well as contravention of the Immigration Act. Colonel Donald Mdhluli said police officers who were on duty said they heard strange noises coming from the holding cells where the men were locked up and went to investigate. “That’s when they discovered the trio had made their dash for freedom,” he said. “A case of escape from lawful custody was immediately opened and an investigation regarding the matter is under way.” Police have launched a manhunt.  He appealed to members of the public, including the suspects’ families, to assist with information that may lead to their rearrest by contacting Detective-Sergeant Sipho Nkuna at 072 790 9238 or call the CrimeStop number at 08600 10111.
