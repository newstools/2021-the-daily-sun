Kosta Papic has parted ways with struggling DStv Premiership side Black Leopards. The Serbian born joined Lidoda Duvha two months ago, following his resignation from Ghanaian side Hearts of Oak. Papic penned a two-year contract with the Venda-based side as their technical manager, working with interim coach Lehlohonolo Seema. "I left three days ago," said Papic. "We agreed that we should part ways. I cannot comment much as the club have not yet made announcement. But I have left Leopards on mutual agreement." Leopards signed Papic hoping his experience will help the team avoid relegation which steering at them in the eye. Papic was set to take over the coaching job from Seema, but that seems unlikely now.  But it looks like the permit issue took longer than anticipated, as he watched Leopards matches from the stands. This was not for the first time Papic signed for Leopards.The well travel coach first joined Leopards in 2013-14 season. He follows in the foot steps of goalie King Ndlovu, who has since quit the club following disagreements with management in a players' meeting. Ndlovu submitted a letter requesting the club to release him from his contract.Leopards have also suspended their trio - Lifa Hlongwane, Tebogo Makobela and Onyedikachi Ononogbu - for misconduct after they took part in an illegal Easter Weekend tournament organised by Thabiso Semenya. Leopards next host Stellenbosch in their another must-win at Thohoyandou Stadium on 21 April (3pm). They are languising at the foot of the log with 13 points from 22 games.
