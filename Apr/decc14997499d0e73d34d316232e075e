Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize has described the late Dr Frank Mdlalose as a role model and a great leader. Mkhize said serving as an MEC for the first time under the leadership of Mdlalose, was challenging times but he gave a positive direction in moving forward. The minister was speaking during the vaccination sites inspection on Thursday, 8 April. He said: “He was my first premier and appointed me to the department of health and I just want to send my condolences to family and friends, colleagues and comrades. He was a role model, a teacher and a father. He was also a community builder and a community leader who taught us a lot.” He said he learned a lot under Mdlalose’s leadership. “I will always remember him as a man of peace, very friendly, cheerful, very encouraging and supportive. He was a peacemaker. He pointed all the areas where there was violence, he negotiated and got people to talk peace. He could defuse a confrontation on the spot,” said Mkhize. Mdlalose was the first premier of KwaZulu-Natal after the ANC won the country’s first all-inclusive general election in April 1994. He died on Saturday following Covid-19 related complications and he was laid to rest on Thursday in Newcastle.
