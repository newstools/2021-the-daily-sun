SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo is walking a tightrope heading into the league fixture against Moroka Swallows on Tuesday. United visit the Birds at Dobsonville Stadium tonight (5pm). With only one win in 14 matches, Tembo is going through the worst period of his coaching career and he might not escape the looming axe.  According to a source within the club, Tembo’s job is hanging by a thread and the result against Swallows may well seal his fate.  Injuries to key players, including Bradley Grobler, who played a cameo role against Black Leopards, hasn’t helped his course. “We were happy that Bradley (Grobler) could play for the final 15-minutes. He is not yet match-fit, but he will be able to get more minutes in our upcoming game on Tuesday against Moroka Swallows,” said Tembo. “It will not be an easy game as Swallows are doing well. They just got a crucial point against Celtic. We can only grow in confidence and take the positives from this game into our next game.” Tembo has been in the hotseat for nearly three years now.  He has so far guided Matsatsantsa to two cup finals, winning one.
