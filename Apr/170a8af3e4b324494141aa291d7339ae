His first kiss meant nothing to him, so he thought. But being put under pressure by his friends at Tsope High School in Ritspruit, Monakato in North West, soccer legend Jacob "Dona" Tshisevhe said he had to try it again in 1989 while still in Matric (Grade 12 today). "It was all about peer pressure," he said before bursting into laughter. "I didn't know how to kiss. We just put lips together and the magic took over. I don't know whether it was a great first kiss or not. I was told that if she's your girlfriend then you have to kiss and have sex, like on TV. "Most of the time we spent time holding hands, but shy to put tongues together. One of us had to have strength to open the kiss proposal. But interestingly I was never tipped by friends on how to ask her for sex." He said after that he started enjoying having girlfriends. "But I didn't do a lot of talking, they came to me as a soccer player at the time," he explains. "Because I was a yellow bone (light in complexion), girls used to throw themselves at me. Footballers' love life was easy at the time because your performance talks on your behalf, and you just reap the rewards of being a great player." In his amateur days Tshisevhe, who became more popular while playing for Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana, launched his amateurish football career with Madibana Ramblers and Western Rangers at Mpidike in Bleskop, North West. He was at Sandtfontein Hurricanes when he was scouted by the mighty Amakhosi.
