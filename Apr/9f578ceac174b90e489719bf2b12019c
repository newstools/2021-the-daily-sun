Tuesday, 27 April marked 27 years since South Africans cast their votes for a democratically elected government. Though there are still problems such as systematic racism and long-term effects of apartheid’s spatial planning, citizens – particularly black people – appreciate the freedom and rights that came with democracy. Daily Sun asked SunReaders for their views on democracy and how they’d been exercising their rights. Sejeso Banda (64) said: “For me, things are better than before because people were not free during apartheid. Previously, people didn’t have the opportunity to open businesses of their choice.  “However, the problem is now finance and others. But it’s better to be free.” Mathapelo Mamabolo (22) told the People’s Paper: “I appreciate that our parents fought for us. We’re now able to go anywhere without carrying IDs. Children couldn’t play outside at certain times but they’re now free.  “I exercised my right and voted in 2019 for the first time.” Slindokuhle Ntanzi (18) said although women have freedom, they don’t enjoy being in positions of power as much as men.  “We have freedom of speech and expression, but we’re not really free as women,” she said. “This is because most positions of power are still occupied by men, and women are not afforded the same opportunity. “I’d be able to define democracy if we had a female president.” She said that for now she’d be withholding her democratic right to vote as she believed political parties are dishonest. Phumlani Langa (32) said even though young people enjoy freedom, they’re still battling and are unemployed.  “A lot of young people are not working and loiter in the streets.” To celebrate democracy and the upcoming 2021 local government elections, Daily Sun will co-host a webinar in collaboration with the Delegation of the European Union to South Africa. The webinar is designed to build on the discussion that all the daily freedoms we take for granted are there because we live in a democratic state.
