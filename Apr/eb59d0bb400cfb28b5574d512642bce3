PREGNANT women are frustrated with the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. This is because they have to pay R1 500 to terminate a pregnancy. But they don’t understand why they have to pay as it is a public hospital. They also told Daily Sun that they couldn’t afford to pay the fee, and needed help urgently. A 24-year-old from Vosloorus said she was 14 weeks pregnant and couldn’t afford to pay the amount. She said she was from an underprivileged family, so needed to terminate the pregnancy. She went to the hospital on Monday, 12 April, and was told that the doctor was busy. ALSO READ: PLAYING A SONG COULDN’T SAVE HIS LIFE! “I was also told I needed R1 500 in order to get the pills. I was appalled by this because these services are usually free for people who can’t afford to pay. I made it clear I can’t afford it,” she said. Another woman (31) said she was hurt to discover that she had to pay at a public facility. She said she lost her job last year when lockdown started. “If I had money, I’d obviously go to a private hospital. But I can’t and time is not on my side,” she said. Another woman told Daily Sun that her time was up on Monday, and she had to start accepting that she was pregnant. She said she was now three months along, and there was nothing she could do.

A staff member said a lot of women had reached out to her and she was sad they had to pay. “I don’t understand why they have to pay this amount at a public hospital.” Daily Sun spoke to Gauteng Health Department spokeswoman Kwara Kekana, who confirmed that public health facilities were free for those who couldn’t afford. The department will investigate the matter.
