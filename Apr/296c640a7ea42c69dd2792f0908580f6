Orlando Pirates were crowned National Soccer League (NSL) Premier League champions when the country was first entering their Freedom, better known as Freedom Year. It was the 10th edition of the NSL First Division, as it was called at the time, in South Africa where Pirates recorded the least number of defeats, three, in a season. Pirates won the title in the 1993/94 season with players like William Okpara, Mark Fish and Marks Maponyane still in their ensemble. With this important win, Pirates went on to play in the African Champions League, which they won in 1995. Cape Town Spurs were runners up in a league that was made up of 18 teams. At the time two teams were relegated, instead of today's PSL made up of 16 teams and only one get dropped while the other will go through the play-offs. Pretoria City and Royal Tigers were relegated for having finished 18th and 17th, respectively. D'Alberton Callies, who finished 16th, was disbanded in the following season, and sold their status to Peter Rabali who created Rabali Blackpool.
