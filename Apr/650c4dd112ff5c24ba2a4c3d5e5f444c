In light of the EFF’s call for the local election to be postponed to 2024, let me point out that the issue doesn’t rest only with political parties but also with citizens. The election is guided by the Constitution. It’s selfishly ambitious of the EFF to call for its postponement without consulting the people. It’s easy for the EFF to make this call, but there are communities that can’t wait for the local election so they may elect new, preferred candidates. Covid-19 has been hard on everyone, but we have learnt to adapt to the new normal. Meetings are now held virtually, masks are worn, hands are sanitised and social distancing is maintained. These are the protocols we need to observe to ensure that the local elections are held successfully, freely and fairly. 
 Extending the governing party’s duration that was conceived through the Constitution is tantamount to human-rights violation.Political parties should establish new, innovative ways to canvass for votes, in line with Covid-19 safety measures. Social media, for instance, could be used as a new form of campaigningn executing duties that were predominantly carried out physically in the past is proof that the world is changing and so should be some of the things we used to do. Politicians can still encourage voters to vote without having to physically reach out to them at their respective homes or at rallies. Let the local election be held this year, in line with what’s dictated by the country’s Constitution. And let the masses decide who rules. Gottenburg eManyeleti
