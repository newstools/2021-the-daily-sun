THE Cape Town Magistrates Court has granted bail to Frederick Mhangazo (35), who is accused of setting a fire on Table Mountain. He appeared in court on Wednesday, 28 April where his charges were changed from arson to charges of “lighting or causing an open fire without proper authority”. Mhangazo is out of R500 bail. Western Cape NPA spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said: “Frederick Mhangazo appeared in the Cape Town Magistrates Court this afternoon. “His charge of arson has been changed to the above charge. The accused could not be linked to arson. He was granted bail and bail was set at R500. His case was then postponed until 18 June 2021 for further investigation.” The accused was allegedly seen setting a fire on Table Mountain with other two people who managed to escape. He was bust by law enforcement officials on the evening of 18 April, the same day that the fire spread to the University of Cape Town’s library. The UCT buildings damaged in the fire included the Jagger Reading Room, the HW Pearson Building, the Smuts Hall student residence, Cadboll House and La Grotta. Meanwhile, UCT resumed classes on Monday after the university was forced to halt learning activities due to the fire. Students were evacuated from the campus and were accommodated at various hotels after blankets of smoke engulfed their residences.
