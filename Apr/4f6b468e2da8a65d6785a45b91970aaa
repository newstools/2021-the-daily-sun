DEPUTY Minister in the Presidency Thembi Siweya said the only way to honour Lufuno Mavhunga was to correct all wrongdoings that some pupils of Mbilwi Secondary School were seen doing in the video that’s been circulating on social media since Monday, 12 April. Siweya delivered an eulogy in Tshirenzheni Village on Saturday, 17 April during an emotional funeral of the grade 10 pupil, who committed suicide soon after the video of her being attacked by a fellow pupil went viral on social media. During the funeral service, some pupils cried uncontrollably as they remembered their late schoolmate. “Schools should be protected areas. We want the department of education to develop programmes and work with the School Governing Body and teachers to make schools safer places,” said Siweya. Limpopo MEC for Education Polly Boshielo said she had hoped to see Lufuno at the Ranch Hotel near Polokwane in the next two years when matric results are announced.  “I had hoped to see her representing her school and collecting some awards as the school is one of the best performing in the province,” she said. Representing the pupils of Mbilwi, Dembe Mutshinyalo said the death of her fellow schoolmate and close friend disturbed her. “Life will never be same without Lufuno in our class,” she said. Lufuno was buried in Tshirenzheni Village graveyard.  Meanwhile, the 15-years-old girl who was arrested for allegedly assaulting Lufuno appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrates Court on Friday, 16 April. NPA spokeswoman in Limpopo Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said the arrested pupil would be dealt with in accordance with the Child Justice Act. She said the matter was remanded to 20 April for a formal bail application.
