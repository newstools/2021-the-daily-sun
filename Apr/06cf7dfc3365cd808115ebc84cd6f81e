PUPILS who bully other pupils should be reported to teachers and arrested by the police. Limpopo education MEC Polly Boshielo visited Mbilwi Secondary School in Sibasa outside Thohoyandou yesterday. This comes after the death of grade 10 pupil Lufuno Mavhunga, who committed suicide soon after a video of her being attacked by fellow a fellow pupil went viral on social media on Monday, 12 April. “We will no longer tolerate bullying in our schools, because it disturbs learning and teaching,” said the MEC. “Don’t talk to other pupils in an abusive way. He or she is a human being like you.” Boshielo said some people come from poor backgrounds and others from rich families, but everybody must be treated with respect. She was joined by health MEC Phophi Ramathuba and senior traditional leader Thovhele Gole Mphaphuli to give support and encouragement to pupils. The delegation also visited the bereaved Mavhunga family in Tshirenzheni, Nzhelele. Ramathuba said she wanted pupils to take their education seriously. “Don’t use abusive language. “Be careful when you talk to someone. “Don’t become a bully. You are warned,” said Ramathuba. Mphaphuli said Mbilwi Secondary’s known to be one of the best academic schools in Limpopo and urged pupils to end the bullying. Tshilidzi Nevhufumba, Lufuno’s close friend, said her death would be difficult to forget. “Life will never be same without Lufuno in the class and we will miss her smiling face,” said Tshilidzi. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said Thohoyandou police arrested a 15-year-old schoolgirl on Wednesday for allegedly assaulting another pupil who later died in an apparent suicide. Mojapelo said the arrested child was facing an assault charge and will be dealt with in accordance with the Child Justice Act.
