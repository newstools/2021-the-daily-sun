HE lost his teeth and has a broken leg. This after he was run over by a drunk cop. The Puni family from Langa in Cape Town want justice for five-year-old Lingomso. His mum, Nosicelo (41), told Daily Sun she was at work when she received a call about the incident. “Witnesses said my child was playing with other kids on the pavement when a drunk cop ran over my child. “I was told he didn’t even stop after hitting him. He drove off as if nothing happened,” she said. Nosicelo said her son couldn’t eat properly and is in pain. “The person who did this to him is out there like nothing happened. “He doesn’t care. He should’ve come to see how my son is doing if it was a mistake,” she said. A resident said the cop who hit Lingomso was drunk. “Police officers do not respect their jobs.How are they going to protect us if they are always drunk?” asked the resident. “A second police van came after the child was hit. We stopped them but they told us they didn’t hit the child and then left.” Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a reckless and negligent driving case was opened. She said circumstances surrounding the incident were being investigated. “According to information, a five-year-old child was knocked over by a marked police vehicle and the driver drove away from the crime scene,” she said. Rwexana said the child was transported to hospital for treatment.
