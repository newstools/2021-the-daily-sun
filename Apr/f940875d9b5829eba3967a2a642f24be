Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has announced that the country has secured 51 million Covid-19 vaccines doses. Mkhize accompanied Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Health MEC Nomathemba Mokgethi on Thursday to vaccination sites ahead of the phase two vaccine roll-out expected to kick off on 17 May. Charlotte Maxeke Hospital and the Salvation Army old age home in Soweto were among vaccination sites inspected. Addressing the media, Mkhize said 31 million doses had been secured from Johnson & Johnson, which is a one-dose vaccine, and 20 million doses from Pfizer – a two-dose vaccine. Mkhize said: “We’re reliant on the flow of vaccine coming from manufacturers at their own pace and we can’t do anything to force them to move faster. This has been a limitation in a way that we run our vaccination programme. “Another matter that keeps me awake at night is that the demand for vaccines is always higher than the vaccines that are available.”  The minister said nearly two million Johnson & Johnson vaccines will be received this month: 900 000 doses in May and an additional 900 000 in June. Elderly people, essential workers and people with comorbidities will be prioritised in the second phase of the vaccine roll-out, which is expected to take place for six months. “We’re very excited that we’re now almost out of the woods with the procurement of Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines,” said Mkhize. “It’s for this reason that we’re visiting provinces to assess the readiness to roll out the vaccine.” He said the one million AstraZeneca vaccines, which were found ineffective against the country’s variant, were not wasted but distributed to other African countries that don’t have the same variant as South Africa. “Today I’m also pleased to announce that Treasury has confirmed that the Serum Institute of India has fully refunded us for the remaining 500 000 doses that had not been delivered to South Africa and the money is already in our bank account.”
