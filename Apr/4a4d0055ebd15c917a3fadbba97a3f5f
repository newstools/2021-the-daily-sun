AWARD-WINNING veteran Umhlobo Wenene FM presenter Mphuthumi “Putco” Mafani is returning to the station after a four-year hiatus. He made the announcement on social media early this week, much to the excitement of his fans. He posted: “Thank you Lord for April 2021. Enkosi ngobabalo lwakho kum. This week highlights my return to the province in Port Elizabeth for two very important roles in my career. “Brand ambassador for the Eastern Cape Transport Tertiary Co-operative and on-air kuMhlobo Wenene FM. Ndawoni kuMhlobo? Will leave that one to you to guess!” Announcing Putco’s return on Wednesday, 31 March, Umhlobo Wenene station manager, Phumzile Mnci, said he’d fill the big gap left by the passing of Loyiso Sitsheke on the Ezemidlalo Nolonwabo show on Saturdays from 7am to 9am.

An excited Putco told Daily Sun he was grateful for the opportunity to share his wealth of sports experience with Umhlobo listeners. “It certainly feels good to be back. Listeners can expect magic as usual. I’ll go deeper into issues affecting sports in our country without fear or favour. But we will also celebrate game changers in sport. “I hope to use my networks in football and across all other sporting codes to do exciting, rare stories. I can’t wait to contribute to the upliftment of sports.” Putco previously hosted the Breakfast Eyondlayo Ekuseni show with Pastor Nozewu, Mluleki Ntsabo and Mafa Bavuma. Bhutiza, as he’s known, shocked fans in 2017 when he announced his departure from the station.
