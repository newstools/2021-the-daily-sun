LILLIAN Dube is joining Moja Love’s remake of SABC1 hit sitcom, Emzini Wezinsizwa. According to sources, the new show will be called Emzini Wabadala. “The new show is going to feature the remaining cast of the original show, and Lillian is joining as one of the leads,” said a source. The veteran actress will be playing the role of a matriarch who takes care of people at an old-age home. “The new format is centred around an old-age home, whereas the original show took place at a hostel,” said another source. “The SABC refused Moja Love the right to keep the original format of the show, which is why it changed it.” Lillian has apparently been working on the show for months.
