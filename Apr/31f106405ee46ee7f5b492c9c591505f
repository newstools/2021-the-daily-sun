LEAVING your panties at your boyfriend’s place can end in tears! This is according to traditional healer Dr Child Myaka, who has dealt with one too many of these cases. Speaking to Daily Sun Dr Myaka said women must make sure they pack all they came with after a visit, because they don’t know what their competitors will do. “We know very well that muthi is used in all these matters. It doesn’t matter if you think you are the main lady – if you’re a visitor, behave like a visitor.” He said marking your territory by leaving something as crucial as underwear is very dangerous. “Once you’ve worn underwear, it doesn’t matter if you’ve washed it or not, your scent stays there. Your competitor can take it to a sangoma and work it so that you are eliminated from the picture. “Once this happens, you will start fighting with your partner and lose the relationship.” Muthi specialist Nkanyiso Ntuli claimed dealing with such cases is heartbreaking. “That relationship will not last,” claimed Ntuli. “So ladies, it’s not worth it marking your territory. It’s better to be safe than sorry because we live in a cruel world. The guy might not have any long-term intentions for you.”
