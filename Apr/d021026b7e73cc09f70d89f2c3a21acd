UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said he wanted to “rebuild the unity” of the European football body yesterday after six English clubs back-tracked on plans to join the rebel Super League. The withdrawal by Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, just two days after the league’s unveiling, left just six Spanish and Italian clubs involved. “I said yesterday that it’s admirable to admit a mistake and these clubs made a big mistake. “But they’re back in the fold now and I know they have a lot to offer, not just to our competitions, but to the whole of the European game. “The important thing now is that we move on and rebuild the unity,” Ceferin said in a statement.” The withdrawals followed an angry reaction from fans, officials and politicians who said Super League was greedy and anti-competitive, as teams were guaranteed a spot each year. – REUTERS
