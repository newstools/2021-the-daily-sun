WHEELCHAIR-BOUND Shadrack Mphokane (65) believes he was tricked by a sangoma who burnt his feet in a steam bath. Shadrack from Mmotla in Tshwane said he went for a haircut at a barber who had recently been initiated as a sangoma. He then promised to give him back his mobility. But instead, now his feet are rotting and he doesn’t see himself walking again. He said the sangoma told him he had a vision of him walking, and gave him a list of things to buy for a steam treatment. He then went to the sangoma’s house, where nine hot stones were waiting for him. “He put my feet in a hole and added the stones. I felt my feet burning but he told me to be patient and strong. He told me there was a curse that made me like this, and wanted to do a ritual at my house so it can go away.” Shadrack paid the sangoma R300 and conducted the ritual. “He wants more money, but I’m not giving it to him,” he said. He said the sangoma doesn’t want him to go to hospital. “I feel like I am losing my feet. I watch them rotting and I’m scared. I regret listening to the sangoma. I went for a haircut and now, I am fighting for my life,” he said. When Daily Sun contacted the sangoma known as Kenny, he said he was trying to help Shadrack walk again. “If the family is patient, Shadrack will walk again. But it will take a long time,” he said. He claimed he did not cause the rotting and wounds, and wanted to work with hospital doctors to help Shadrack. Solly Mathebula of Bangoma Union of Traditional Healers said the family could report the sangoma if they felt mistreated. “If the patient feels they are not getting healed, they should seek help elsewhere.” He said if Shadrack was getting burnt, then he was in danger. “As healers, we don’t know everything. Some force things because of hunger and greediness.”
