A GAY man from Nyanga, Cape Town, went out to celebrate his birthday on Friday, 16 April, and it was the last time his family saw him alive. They were only called on Sunday morning, 18 April, after Lonwabo Jack (22) was found raped and killed in the backyard of a house in the Mau Mau area, Nyanga. The house where his body was found is next door the house where his party was being hosted. His uncle, Monwabisi Jack (57) said his nephew had stab wounds, one on his chest and the other in his back. “We still don’t know what happened but he was raped and stabbed to death. According to the friends who were with him, he excused himself and said he was coming back but after an hour or so, they saw his body in the neighbour’s yard,” said Monwabisi. The family is devastated and have called for justice for Lonwabo, whom they said was a sweet person.  “He loved his family and he was a prayer warrior. Every day you would hear him praying in his room. His death came as a shock and we are devastated. We want cops to catch his killers and justice must be served,” said Wodi Jack (68), his aunt who stayed with him. The incident happened a day after gay and lesbian activists marched to parliament on Saturday, demanding justice for another gay man Andile “Lulu” Nthuthela who was killed in Eastern Cape recently. Gay activist Ntobeko Ningi (27) said he was sad about the death of his friend and he called for cops to arrest the killers. “We are not safe. Cops must deal with these killers. We are going to escalate and take this matter to the streets. We are being killed for nothing,” said Ningi. Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incident. “The circumstances surrounding the death of an unknown man are being investigated after his body was discovered in Pula Road, Mau Mau, in Nyanga on Sunday morning. No one has been arrested as yet,” said Traut.
