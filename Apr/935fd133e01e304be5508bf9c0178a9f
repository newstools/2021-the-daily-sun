A 35-YEAR-OLD man appeared in the Cape Town Regional Court on Tuesday, 20 April facing arson charges. He was allegedly caught setting a fire on the mountain. Frederick Mhangazo was arrested on Sunday night and two of his alleged accomplices managed to escape. He made a brief appearance and his case has been postponed to 28 April. Firefighters are still battling the blaze that raged through Table Mountain and destroyed buildings at UCT. City of Cape Town fire and rescue spokesman Jermaine Carelse said most parts of the fire on Table Mountain have been extinguished. “Three days since the start of the devastating Rhodes Memorial blaze, the fire has been largely contained with firefighting efforts now focused on Deer Park and the Disa Park towers in Vredehoek. “Crews have worked tirelessly, and the wind having died down considerably has given them some respite,” he said. Meanwhile, the fire forced UCT to abandon classes as students were evacuated to safe places. UCT vice-chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng said the university has lost irreplaceable treasures in the fire that damaged the library on Sunday. She said the only way to recover them is to create more knowledge. “UCT will, of course, rebuild facilities. We can’t replace the treasures of scholarship we’ve lost, but we can create new treasures out of our own scholarship,” said Phakeng. “In the same way, each of us can rebuild our own sense of purpose out of this tragedy. To do so, we need to help each other.” She said the academic programme will resume on Monday, 26 April. “The faculties will each manage the lost week in terms of the curriculum and will communicate with their students about scheduled tests and assignments,” she said. The City of Cape Town’s disaster management department said residents who were evacuated were given the go-ahead to return to their homes on Monday night.
