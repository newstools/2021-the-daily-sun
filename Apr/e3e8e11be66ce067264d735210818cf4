Pretoria Callies are tired of Black Leopards' moves to their new coach, Joel "Muporofita" Masutha, and chairman Moses Malada put his foot down: "he's is going nowhere!" Malada told the DStv Premiership to back off. Leopards have been trying to lure their former goalkeeper to take the coaching job after the club parted ways with Kosta Papic on Monday. Leopards are bottom on the log facing relegation and the Venda-based side believe Masutha is the right man to save them. “I got a call from Leopards officials asking about Masutha,” said Malada. “I told them (Leopards officials) that Masutha is our coach and we have big plans with him for this club. Masutha is a good coach and that is why we will not let him go.” Masutha, who also declined the job through SunSport on Wednesday, is well known for guiding Lidoda Duvha back to the top flight three seasons ago after they spent five seasons in the Championship. Masutha confirmed to SunSport that Leopards have contacted him offering him the coaching job at the struggling Premiership club. Leopards are left with eight league matches to save their PSL status. Malada said: “We are not going to put any pressure on Masutha and the team. To be in the Nedbank Cup semifinals is huge to us and the boys. Our goal is to see this team remain in the Championship so that we can set new goals for next season with Masutha. All I want from the team is to enjoy themselves in the semifinal." Callies will on Saturday welcome Chippa United at Lucas Moripe Stadium for their cup semifinal show at 3pm.
