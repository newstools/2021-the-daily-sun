MULTI-AWARD winning maskandi star Khuzani Mpungose has joined forces with Team Meyo to honour late Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini with a song. They aim to kill two birds with one stone – pay tribute to the king and fund students with money raised from the song downloads. On Thursday, 15 April, they recorded the single titled Izwe leMEYO. They expect to release it on 7 May. According to Khuzani, they will shoot the music video on 24 May. Khuzani told SunBuzz: “I’m happy that Team Meyo decided to work with me as they usually work with many artists to empower students with funds. “I heard this organisation has helped about 166 000 tertiary students with funds since it was formed 10 years ago,” he said.

Funds raised from the song will be used to educate students. Makhaza said the late Zulu king used to support and attend their events because he wanted the youth to be educated. “We’re paying tribute to our king and helping kids to get a better education,” he said. “We decided to celebrate the life of the late king and encourage ubuntu among people. “In the music video, we’ll use locations that are not usually shown and we’ve also invited Amabutho.”
