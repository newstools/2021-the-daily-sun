There has been a fuss among ordinary citizens and prominent public figures, since Prasa announced that it intended to deploy prison leavers to repair rail infrastructure. This is bad news to many people as they say the campaign rewards criminal behaviour. Many argue that these opportunities should have been given to millions of unemployed people with no criminal records. We all know that rehabilitated prisoners had, for many years, been discriminated against. If government doesn’t do it, who is going to recruit them? Experts say a second chance gives ex-offenders some dignity. Some do change for the better because the vast majority don’t want to go back to jail. I believe that most, but not all, criminals deserve a second chance. - Letter by Elton Harris
