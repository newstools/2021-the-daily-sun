I’m a woman alone at night on my way home from work and took an UBER BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SAFER,” she wrote and later deleted the original tweet. In her follow-up tweets she described the whole experience as scary and terrifying. “I’ve shared my live location with someone but the Uber driver got lost and then we landed up going towards the opposite side of Johannesburg and in the city deep.
