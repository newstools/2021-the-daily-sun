RASTA has made too many paintings of celebrities and politicians who have died. And most of his work has angered many people who didn’t see any resemblance. Now, someone decided to give the Zimbabwean-born artist a taste of his own medicine and left Mzansi in stitches with a drawing of Rasta. The image has gone viral on social media and people hope he learns from this experience. Daily Sun spoke to Rasta, who laughed and said nothing would stop him from doing what he loved. The painter, whose real name is Lebani Sirenje, said he’d never mock anyone with his paintings. He believes that his paintings do resemble his subjects. He also said he was proud of his work and that nothing would discourage him. “I’ve been criticised too many times on social media and it hurts when people do this to me but I know I’m good at what I do and I will continue,” said Rasta. He said South Africa was a free country so if anyone wanted to do a drawing of him, they should do so by all means. Stella Mabuza said: “Rasta is well aware that his paintings are out of line. I hope he’ll understand it offends people and that he needs to stop.” Hitomi Martin said he was pleased to see that someone wanted to teach Rasta a lesson. “Mzansi has asked Rasta to stop painting but the request seems to be motivating him to paint some more. We’re tired of seeing his portraits and hope he’ll start painting proper things or just retire,” said Hitomi.
