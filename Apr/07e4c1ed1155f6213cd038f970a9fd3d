Other than infidelity, one of the key dealbreakers in relationships is money. If the man never shows his payslip to his partner, she might think he’s not bringing all the cash home. On the other hand, some men who’re open about how much they earn still get in trouble with their partners for misusing the money. Couples need to sit down from time to time and discuss their financial incomes and needs. In most cases, conflicts begin when a person feels some of their partner’s needs aren’t necessary. For example, when a man uses a portion of his salary to buy booze, his partner may feel as if he’s drinking too much money away. When a woman gets too deep into beauty and fashion, her partner may feel as if she wastes money on unnecessary things. Being addicted to gambling can make you lose money, and that causes conflict between couples. Couples need to be realistic when discussing their individual needs. A man could feel oppressed and suffocated in a relationship when his partner won’t allow him to go out and drink a small portion of his salary. The same applies to a woman if she’s denied money for fancy clothes and make-up products. Couples need to agree that family needs should come first and then their individual needs will follow. Learn to deny yourself things that aren’t essential when money isn’t enough. To achieve a healthy relationship, couples need to communicate on how to spend their income. - Letter by S P Moffat, Mamelodi East
