AFTER four months layoff, the DStv Diski Challenge is back! The coronavirus pandemic put a halt to the PSL reserve league in January but it resumed last weekend under a new name, the DStv Diski Challenge Rewind. The new-look reserve league is divided into two groups, with each group consisting of eight teams. The teams will play each other once, with the two top finishers in each group advancing to the semi-finals, and then the final where the champions will be crowned. SunSport caught up with Chippa midfielder Thulani “Scara” Mini, who said it feels great to be back on the pitch, and they are happy as players. Mini was one of the standout players in the league when it was stopped in January after just four matches. This past weekend he was also on the scoresheet when the Chilli Boys reserves were defeated by Maritzburg United 4-2 at Harry Gwala Stadium. Despite the defeat, Mini remains confident that they will be in the top two, come the end of the round-robin matches. On Sunday, Chippa host AmaZulu at Wolfson Stadium at 10am. He said: “Obviously, we have not been playing for a long time, and our preparations time was not too long. But it feels good to be back and playing again. But I believe in the team we have. If we can play the remaining matches with the same energy we had in the second half when we lost, I believe something positive will come.”
