The  defenders of the people movement are demanding an increase to the relief grant. On Friday the popular movement marched to the Union Buildings in Tshwane to show their grievances. According to their spokesman Ronny Lediga South Africans deserve at least five hundred rand for the relief grant. "We say more money have been looted during this Covid-19 pandemic, while some people do qualify to get this money and others do not qualify. "We have more than 56 million citizens, and only 4 million qualify to get R350,” he said Lediga said they are concerned about why the government suddenly stopped what they have started. He said if they are a caring government, they should take care of their people and stop with the excuses. "We want to know which criteria was used to get others approved and others not. "We need our government to explain to South Africans how this can happen, what about other people who really need this money and are not employed and don't qualify” he asked. He said they marched to Union Buildings to submit the Memorandum about the issue of the R350 grant. He said they have given the office of the President 7 days to respond to their demand. He said if the government fail to respond they will mobilise thousands of people to march again to the Union Buildings again. "Due to Covid-19 regulations only 200 members were allowed to participate in the march," he said. He said they are appealing to people to support the grievances put forward. Spokesperson to the Office of the Presidency, Vincent Ngcobo received the memorandum. He said they will respond in seven working days.
