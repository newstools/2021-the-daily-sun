The march organised by Cosas and the ANC Youth League outside Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga’s offices on 19 April wasn’t appropriate. This came after Limpopo pupil Lufuno Mavhunga committed suicide, allegedly because she was being bullied by a fellow pupil. Motshekga, who didn’t instigate the incident, is being blamed. That’s totally wrong! The demonstrators claim she ignored the matter when she visited the province and failed to visit the school and bereaved family. Even if she’d done so, that was not going to bring back Lufuno. What they say suggests Motshekga could’ve revived Mavhunga. Theirs is a nonsensical point of view. The minister wasn’t there when the incident took place. I don’t understand what connects her to Lufuno’s death. But this comes as no surprise, which is why South Africa is full of people who like to blame others for their personal agendas. Without a doubt, bullying is a societal and behavioural problem. But I don’t think the school, or education department for that matter, should be made to shoulder all the blame. For example, every student who stood by and watched that bullying incident is liable. The fact is that a bullied child will often downplay the incident to avoid further bullying. Honestly speaking, education about bullying is basically the role of parents. - Letter by Vivian Goso, Sebokeng
