City of Joburg MMC for Infrastructure and Environmental Services Mpho Moerane did an oversight inspection to monitor the progress on the construction of a new substation in Eldorado Park. During his visit, Moerane called on the community to take ownership and ensure the work is completed. This comes after the construction had been temporary delayed due to the legal and contractual disputes with the previous contractor. Moerane was accompanied by City Power chairwoman Lindiwe Maseko, CEO Mongezi Ntsokolo and fellow executives. Moerane said he was happy there was progress on the work done.

What the community went through is unbearable, especially in winter. So we want that to change,” said Moerane. The substation supplies electricity to customers in surrounding areas including Klipspruit, Kliptown, and Devland. City Power CEO Ntsokolo said the new technology that will be installed will improve power supply. The construction of the substation is expected to be completed by the end of June 2022.
