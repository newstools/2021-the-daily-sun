ACCORDING to the Mareme family, they were preparing to sleep on Monday, 19 April when they saw a huge flame coming from one of the rooms in their home. And the next thing they knew the flames had destroyed their entire home in Rockville in Temba, Hammanskraal, Tshwane. They told Daily Sun they lost everything in the flames. Family member Catherine Mareme (62) said: “We don’t know how the fire started. We only saw huge smoke coming out of the rooms. “We tried to stop it and even the community members tried to help us, but all the rooms were on fire.” Catherine said although their furniture, clothes, food and documents were burnt, they’re grateful no one died. Family member Peter Mojela (56) said the loss of his ID book will delay all his plans. “We need help with building material, clothes, food and anything that we can use,” he said. Head of community patrollers, Mike Sadike (52), said: “This is painful. We’ll stand with this family until they get past this suffering.” City of Tshwane emergency service deputy chief, Charles Mabaso, said they received a call at 9.20pm. At the scene they found a shack and house burning. “After extinguishing the fire, the disaster management official was called to co-ordinate social relief for three adults and two minors,” he told the People’s Paper. “The cause of the fire is unknown. “The family have requested that the South African police be informed since they suspect arson.”
