It might still be early, but teams like Maritzburg United and Orlando Pirates have set their intentions straight in the DStv Diski Challenge Rewired. After three rounds of matches, Pirates have been on an impressive run, winning all three games to top their Group Two with nine points. They are the only team yet to drop points. On Tuesday, they will look to maintain their winning run when they face Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) at 12. Tshakhuma are going to this match searching for their first win. In two games, they have drawn once and lost once. Swallows FC will kick off the day with a tricky clash against Bloemfontein Celtic at 10am. Celtic are also one of the teams that are yet to win a match in the Diski Rewired. If they fail to win their matches, Celtic and TTM will dim their chances of reaching the tournament's semifinals. The two teams that finish in the top two from each group will qualify for the semifinals. So far, the usual suspects (big three) Mamelodi Sundowns, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs seem to be among the favourites to go to the next round from Group two. In Group one, Maritzburg United and AmaZulu are first and second respectively with seven points each. On Wednesday, Black Leopards face Sundowns in the morning (10am), while Chiefs will play the last match against Baroka FC. Leopards coach Mongezi Bobe said he was happy with his team's improvement since the Diski returned. "I am very proud of the players. In the matches that have been played so far, they have done well. They keep on improving every game, and we have been drawing some positives despite not winning the games." -SuperSport
