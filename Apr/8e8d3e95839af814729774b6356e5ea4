After eight years on the run, a former South African Revenue
Service (SARS) official convicted of VAT fraud has finally been arrested along
with a financial advisor. In July 2004, Rudi Willemse, and two financial advisors,
Hein Fourie and Abraham van Wyk, were sentenced in the Klerksdorp Magistrate's
Court to an effective seven years in prison for fraud and corruption. "The matter involved a refund for a false VAT input
claim to the value of R2.7 million, submitted on behalf of an entity called
Elandslaagte Mining in Klerksdorp. The claim was submitted for the alleged
purchase of mining equipment which never took place, and the SARS officials
were bribed to approve the refund," said SARS commissioner Edward Kieswetter. Willemse, Fourie and Van Wyk obtained leave to appeal their
convictions. After several years of appeal process, the appeal was denied and
the three accused were instructed to report to correctional services
authorities to begin their term. However, all three failed to appear and
warrants were issued for their arrest. Van Wyk later died. Last month, Willemse and Fourie were traced by the
Klerksdorp police's Tracing Unit and were arrested, Kieswetter said. "[SARS] welcomes the arrest of two convicted VAT
fraudsters who thought they had escaped justice by disappearing off the face of
the earth for eight years, said Kieswetter. "SARS is determined to ensure that actions by our staff
are beyond reproach and will combat any criminal action on the part of SARS
employees and citizens who try to defraud the fiscus of much-needed revenue.
The South African public places enormous trust in SARS employees to execute
their work dutifully and loyally, and the action of Mr Willemse betrays that
trust." SOURCE: NEWS24
