Families of the dead miners still trapped underground at Lily Mine have braved severe harassment in the past year. They’ve been camping outside the shaft as they hopelessly wait for the bodies of their relatives to be retrieved. The families have been camping since last year without help from the mining authorities or government. There’s been a barrage of promises to retrieve the bodies and help families find closure, but nothing has happened. The families are still waiting for politicians to honour their promises. The families have no political connections, which is why they are getting the cold shoulder from Gwede Mantashe. Letter by Bushy Green, Kagiso
