IF it wasn’t for a kind taxi boss, a gogo and her granddaughter would have been left stranded at a taxi rank on Monday, 12 April. This after a queue marshal refused to let them board a taxi with the remains of the twins that the 16-year-old girl lost in a miscarriage on Sunday, 11 April. The babies’ remains were in a shopping bag. The 49-year-old gogo from Estcourt, KZN told Daily Sun that taxi boss Scara Mnguni came to their rescue. Scara said he offered to help because he knew the family. “Taxi bosses should help passengers in their time of need. The gogo wished to bury the babies at home but she didn’t have money to hire private transport.” ALSO READ: PLAYING A SONG COULDN’T SAVE HIS LIFE!
