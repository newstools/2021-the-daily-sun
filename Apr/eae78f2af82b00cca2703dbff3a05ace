HOPE Givers Foundation founder Tsakani Mkhari has
mentioned gender-based violence as a thorn to both rural and urban areas across
the whole country. And to overcome that, the foundation launched it’s 1st
annual GBV Tribute Concert and Raising Legends Awards, which will take place on
1 May at Sun Meropa. The launch took place at the Sun Meropa Casino outside
Polokwane in Limpopo on Thursday, 31 March. Tsakani told Daily Sun that gender-based violence has
always been among the ills South Africa has fought against. “The purpose of this initiative is to create a
brotherhood and safe space for young boys and men between the ages of 11 and 35
to have conversations of hope through different programmes of education and
mentorship,” said Tsakani. She said the Raising Legends initiative seeks to highlight
the positive contribution by boys and young men in our communities and
encourage others to follow suit. “The concert will see citizens, churches, business,
government and civil society come together in one voice remembering those who
have lost their lives due to abuse, crime, drug abuse, suicide and mental
health issues,” she said. She said this great initiative was endorsed and
recognised by Brand South Africa in 2019 as the best initiative that positively
advocates for a boy child. Boxing legend Dingaan Thobela said he was happy the
initiative was positively growing and giving hope to the country. “It is important that we give out full support to such
initiatives because these serves as pillars to building a better society,” he
said.
