INCONSISTENCY continues to plague Kaizer Chiefs’ season. The Soweto giants just can’t seem to build any sort of momentum. They continue to dig a hole for themselves with one mistake after another. Gavin Hunt could do nothing but watch as another defensive error cost his side dearly in a 1-0 loss at the hands of Chippa United at FNB Stadium. The culprit this time was centre back Eric Mathoho whose error gifted substitute Bienvenu Eva Nga a golden opportunity to snatch all three points for the Chilli Boys. The Cameroonian grabbed the opportunity with both hands as he bravely put his body on the line before lobbing the ball over Itumeleng Khune in the Chiefs goal. The Chilli Boys handed Amakhosi their eighth loss in a season that has not gone according to plan for the Soweto giants. Chiefs’ 2-1 win over log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns seemed a long time ago as they were made to look meek by struggling Chippa. They once again fail to build momentum and win back-to-back matches with their defensive frailties rearing their ugly head once more. They continue to fight for a top-eight finish which is anything but guaranteed, especially with performances such as the one they displayed against Chippa. The Chilli Boys on the other hand, have taken a huge step towards ensuring their safety from relegation. The much needed three points took them closer to safety with only five matches remaining. The Gqeberha-based outfit are still second from the bottom but now have some distance between them and bottom-placed Black Leopards. They next face Stellenbosch FC at Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Chiefs will hope to bounce back against Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium on the same day (3pm).
