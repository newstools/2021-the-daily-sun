BACK to winning ways! Mamelodi Sundowns have swiftly regained their winning momentum. This after they edged struggling Chippa United 2-1 in a DStv Premiership clash at Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Monday. The result saw the defending champions stretch their lead at the top of the standings to six points, pulling further clear of the chasing pack. The two KwaZulu Natal teams, AmaZulu and Golden Arrows, remain in second and third place with 40 and 38 points, respectively. They will most likely have to double their efforts if they are to give rampant Downs a run for their money in the title race. Downs have two games in hand in addition to their healthy lead at the summit, which could see them pull further clear should they turn into points in the bag. The coaching team at Downs decided to retain only three of the players who started in their shock defeat to CR Belouizdad in the Champions League. Thapelo Morena, Aubrey Modiba and Peter Shalulile were entrusted to help the team return to winning ways. But it was Themba Zwane who broke the deadlock for Downs from the penalty spot after a foul on the inside the penalty box by Riaan Hanamub on Modiba. It was Zwane’s ninth goal of the season, taking him four away from the league’s top scorer in SuperSport United’s Bradley Grobler. The Chilli Boys, who are now in trouble as they lie second from the bottom of the standings, needed a response. They got it through Augustine Chidi Kwem but it did not last long as Downs sealed the win through the reliable Shalulile. Downs are now 20 matches unbeaten in the league, the longest run in PSL history. They now turn their attention to the Nedbank Cup against Orlando Pirates at Loftus Versfeld on Thursday (6pm).
