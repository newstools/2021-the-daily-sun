FOLLOWING an investigation by City Power into the cause of frequent outages affecting the north-eastern corridors, the power utility has decided to patrol and clear electricity lines servitudes of any encroaching objects. The decision was taken during a visit to Sebenza and Westfield substation by City of Joburg MMC for Environment Infrastructure Services Mpho Moerane together with Section 79 chairwoman Matshidiso Mfikoe, City Power CEO Mongezi Ntsokolo and other executives. The investigation found that while most of the outages were due to vandalism and cable theft, a worrying number was due to the faults on the overhead lines caused by the encroaching objects including trees and buildings. An investigation, which started earlier this year found that most of the trees interfering with power transmission were in private homes, especially around Senderwood, Sandringham, Bedforview, Sandton and Morningside, where access was often denied. In a statement, Moerane said: “There shouldn’t be any excuses about what needs to happen after this. I have directed the CEO to embark on a three-week programme to ensure the servitudes are cleared. We also need to be clear and tough to those who refuse us to cut trees in their yards. We will use the law where needs be to ensure by-laws are respected. No one is allowed to build a structure or plant trees under the lines. It’s not only dangerous, but as seen recently, it poses a huge risk to our network leading to frequent outages”. Ntsokolo said he was going to prioritise the programme. “I have ordered my team to do a blanket programme to clear all the servitudes, starting with this one affecting Greenstone. We will also review our Service Level Agreement with City Parks to tighten it so that there is frequent monitoring and clearing of the servitudes.” City Power will also increase security patrols in the area of Greenstone and have requested JMPD and SAPS to assist as well.
