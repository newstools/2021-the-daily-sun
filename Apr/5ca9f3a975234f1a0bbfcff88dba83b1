REAL Housewives of Durban star Ayanda Ncwane found herself in hot water after she was accused of tribalism. This after she said one of the housewives, Kgomotso Ndungane, wasn’t a black person during the show’s season finale on Showmax on Friday, 16 April. While chatting with her brother Phupho Gumede and fellow housewife, Nonkanyiso “LaConco” Conco, she said Kgomotso isn’t black because she’s Tswana. People on social media were offended and she trended on Twitter. Ayanda hasn’t said anything about the backlash, nor has she apologised. ALSO READ: SKEEM SAAM MEETS 7DE LAAN!
