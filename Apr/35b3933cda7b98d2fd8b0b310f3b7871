TWO cops have been arrested for allegedly demanding bribes from undercover officers who posed as motorists over the Easter weekend. The requests for R100 and R200 “cold drink” money by officers operating speed cameras landed them in jail for corruption. According to Ipid, the pair were arrested in two different places over the weekend. Spokeswoman Ndileka Cola said: “The joint sting operation by Ipid, anti-corruption and national traffic anti-corruption units led to the arrest of a 56-year-old captain from the Joburg public order policing unit for corruption at Observatory yesterday, 5 April. “The captain, who was the shift commander, conducted an unauthorised road block with his members at Observatory Street and Steyn Street. “He stopped an undercover vehicle and demanded a driving licence, which the agent didn’t produce. The captain demanded bribery of R100 and entrapment cash was handed over to him.” Cola said he was arrested and detained at Yeoville Police Station. He was set to appear at the Joburg Magistrates Court today, 6 March. Ipid is investigating the case. In another Easter sting operation conducted by Ipid and the units on Friday, 2 April, a 45-year-old traffic cop from Randfontein was arrested for corruption. “The officer was operating a speed camera and stopped an undercover vehicle. He solicited a R200 bribe and was arrested on the spot for corruption and has been detained at Randfontein Police Station,” Cola said.
