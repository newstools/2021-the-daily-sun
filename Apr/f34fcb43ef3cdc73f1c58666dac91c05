CELEBRATED Orlando Pirates legend, Lucky "Phinda Mzala" Lekgwathi has now jumped into the lucrative fast food business. The former Bucs captain and Bafana Bafana legend will this Wednesday launch his first restaurant "Grootman" in Kliptown, Pimville in Soweto. Straight from Ormonde in Joburg, the retired star, known for his fitness after quitting professional football, says the name comes from his other nickname when people referred to him as "Grootman" which means big brother. His entrepreneurship tendencies started with a clothing label "Fantastic 14" which he had previously launched. And he uses the clothing label to sponsor social soccer clubs played during weekends. This past weekend he was in  Moletjie Ga-Sechaba in Polokwane where he donated Soccer equipment and  conducted soccer clinics at the Moletjie Sports Academy. "I can't wait for the launch," was all he would say about "Grootball". SEE GALLERY HERE:
