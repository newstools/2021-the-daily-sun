THE ANC’s step-aside resolution may not be enough to get the party’s secretary-general Ace Magashule to step down from his position. Those who defy the resolution may resort to the stipulation in the guideline that says if a member, office bearer or public representative fails to step aside, the secretary-general or National Working Committee may refer the matter to the Integrity Commission, which must make recommendations to the NEC. This, according to City Press, is likely the route Magashule will take when his time to step aside comes. ANC treasurer general Paul Mashatile told City Press the party would be treating the cases of those criminally charged and those who had not been charged differently. “The reason we created the guidelines was that the NEC wanted to know how to deal with the different categories,” he said. Meanwhile in Mpumalanga, the ANC PEC has vowed to continue with its provincial conference scheduled for the end of May. “Yesterday we left the meeting late at night trying to deal the issues of violence in the branches,” said provincial secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali. “We want to isolate those who have a problem and let the others continue.’ She said they were aware of those who were causing chaos within the branches. She said those calling for the disbandment of the PEC were desperate. “They are the violent ones because they don’t understand the new (online) system.”
