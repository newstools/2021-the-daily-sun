RIHANNA’s hit song We Found Love rings true for Zoleka Mandela. The mother of five broke her own promise by finding love in the arms of a Xhosa-speaking man. In a long Instagram post, the author and breast cancer activist posted a picture of her new bae, saying she couldn’t believe she was dating a Xhosa man even though she swore never to do so. “Zoleka a few months back: OMG! I’d never date a male version of myself. Never!” she captioned a picture of the two of them. “OMG! Xhosa King @King Mayweather, what have you done to me? “Like I actually just dated me forever. I don’t care what I said a few months ago. T the devil is such a liar and you’ve changed my mind. “You’re full of crap like me – never one to pretend and very stubborn, sexually inappropriate and temperamental, like I am.

You love and feel just as intensely as I do, hot and sexy all the time, and you’re pretty much everything you think and say you are – just like me. “Also, we both don’t like being told what to do. We prefer our own company and act before we think. There’s way too much of me that I see and feel in you. “So much I still want to feel and experience with you. Now the world must pray for us because, wow, you and me together is ayeye.” In the comment section, her bae Leeroy Cana responded with the same kind of message, saying they were alike and proclaiming his love for her.
