THE NPA has confirmed Walter Sisulu University student Mfuneko Mankengana, charged for attacking police during a protest last week, has been granted R1 000 bail. The 24-year-old was released on Wednesday, 28 April on condition he attended all court proceedings, didn’t interfere with witnesses, and wasn’t charged with a related offence while the case was ongoing. According to the NPA’s Eastern Cape spokesman Luxolo Tyali, the state decided not to oppose bail after the investigating officer had verified Mankengana’s address and criminal profile. Mankengana faces charges of damage to essential infrastructure, public violence, malicious injury to property and two counts of assault. He was bust on 20 April after a violent protest the previous day near the university campus on Nelson Mandela Drive in Mthatha. Mankengana allegedly was part of a group of student protesters who attacked the police and burnt a Nyala police vehicle with two officers inside. Four cops were injured and hospitalised. The students were demanding answers regarding student accommodation, registrations and Nsfas funding allocation. The case has been postponed to 2 June 2021 for further investigation.
