NTSAKO Mangayi is giving people hope through his poetry. He recently published his first poetry collection titled Yi Wile hi Rimhondzo (fruitful things), which carries a motivational message. The 21-year-old from Mbhokota, Limpopo, said he worked with seven other authors on the collection, published by Muyimeri Publishers. “I want to build the world with poetry, talk to broken souls and give people hope. “I have two other books that are yet to be published. One of them is a novel and was submitted at the Department of Sports, Art and Culture for a competition,” he said. Ntsako started writing in 2015 after being inspired by author Isaac Shabangu.

It’s like a person I talk to when I’m sad or going things.” He told Daily Sun that the lack of resources and financial support was a challenge. “I don’t have a laptop, and many poetry competitions usually need money to enter. Those opportunities slip through my fingers because of my financial background,” he said. Ntsako has a Bachelor of Education degree. He also runs the project Unity of Tribes, where he brings different tribes together for collaborations. “I want my books at schools and to have my own publishing company,” said Ntsako.
