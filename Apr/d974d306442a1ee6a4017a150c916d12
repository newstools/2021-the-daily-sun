She believes the man might have suffered a heart attack. “It was a traumatic experience and I have never seen anything like it,” she said. Another witness said he felt sorry for the family of the deceased. “Imagine his family waiting for him to come home only to receive the news he collapsed and died inside a mall,” said the witness. Sonwabile Cekiso (39) said Covid-19 has caused a lot of stress in people’s lives. “Most of us will die like that. We’re under a lot of pressure. We’re stressed because we’ve lost our jobs and our families are looking at us because we’re breadwinners,” said Sonwabile. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest docket was opened after a 46-year-old man died in a mall in Bernman Drive, Mitchells Plain.
