MORE than R40 million worth of stock, largely PPE, were reduced to ashes after a blaze swept through Charlotte Maxeke hospital in Joburg over the weekend. This was according to Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize after he visited the hospital yesterday. “They showed me the level of destruction the fire caused. “The building has a lot of damage,” Mkhize said. He said some floors were caving in and holes were appearing on others. “No one can actually tell the estimate of the damage until proper and thorough assessment has been done. But over R40 million worth of stock, largely PPE, and other essentials were damaged.” Some parts of the hospital went up in flames, forcing the health facility to temporality close. Patients were moved to other hospitals. On Saturday, Gauteng Premier David Makhura said the hospital would be closed for seven days. Mkhize praised the staff, ambulance crew and everyone involved in evacuating about 840 patients from the burning hospital. “I was pleased to get a report and see the extent of the hard work put into saving lives and the hospital,” he said.
