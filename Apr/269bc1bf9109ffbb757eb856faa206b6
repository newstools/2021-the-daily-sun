EKURHULENI Municipality has condemned the vandalising of several Harambee buses by Tembisa residents today. A number of buses were damaged after residents stoned them during a violent protest. Spokesman Zweli Dlamini said the damage is estimated to thousands of rands. “We can only know the extent of the damage once the assessment is done. We strongly condemn this kind of behaviour,” said Zweli. “Instead of us moving forward, these kinds of incidents take us 10 steps backwards.” Residents from Tembisa were apparently toyi-toying over electricity and houses. This is not the first the buses were vandalised. In 2019, the buses were damaged after unhappy train commuters stormed into them demanding they ferry them to work. The incident occurred after train services were suspended. The municipality had to suspend the bus service temporarily until the issue was resolved. Zweli couldn’t say how many buses were damaged.
