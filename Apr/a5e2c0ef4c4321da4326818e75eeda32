FOR the first time, Mzansi will have two representatives in the Caf Champions League quarter-finals. This after giants Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs both sealed their qualification for the knockout stages. They now look forward to the draw for the quarter-finals to take place on Friday in Cairo, Egypt. This is not unfamiliar territory for Downs, who have made it a habit to reach this stage of the competition in recent years. They have a wealth of experience behind them, having won the competition in 2016 under former coach Pitso Mosimane. The Brazilians, who topped Group B, can only face one of the three teams that finished second in their groups. These include former coach Mosimane’s Al Ahly who finished second in Group, A as well as Algerian side MC Alger and Chiefs. There’s no doubt Mosimane’s return to face his former team would be the most anticipated meeting. Downs have proven how strong they can be this season and would be favourites if they were to face Chiefs, despite their recent loss in the league to Gavin Hunt’s charges. Amakhosi, on the other hand, are in uncharted waters as far as this stage of the competition is concerned. In fact, they had never reached the group stages of the reformed Champions League before their participation this season. They have shrugged off their domestic struggles this season and went on an impressive run on the continent’s premier club competition. But the road is only set to get tougher for them as they wait to learn their next opponents in the draw. Chiefs, who finished second in Group C, will face one of the winners of the other three groups. They can’t be pitted against Wydad Athletic as they were both in the same group. This leaves Tanzanian giants Simba SC, Tunisia’s Esperance and Sundowns as potential opponents in the next round.
