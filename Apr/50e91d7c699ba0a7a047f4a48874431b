 STUDENTS
from the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) have vowed that no teaching
and learning will take place if their demands are not met. They made
this vow following their protest on campus in Umlazi, south of Durban on
Thursday. Student
Representative Council (SRC) faculty officer, Minenhle Shabalala said:
"Nothing is going to happen in this higher learning institution if its
management continues with its way of doing things. We are going to make sure of
that," Among the
things he said they are demanding from the institution is that it allows
students to continue with their registration and proceed to lectures even if
they have debts. He said he
said this is because the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has
confirmed to scores of students that they have been approved for financial aid. "NSFAS
has confirmed that it is going to pay students. Our plea is that we tabled a
few weeks ago to the management is that it allows the registration process of
students to proceed and then the acknowledgment of debt forms would be signed
later because it's already too late," said Shabalala. He said
their proposal also cited that the Covid-19 regulation would not be met if the
university forges through with the idea of forcing students to sign an
acknowledgment of debt forms before they proceed for registration. MUT
Spokeswoman Mbali Mkhize said the institution is aware of the protest. "The
SRC issued the management with their list of demands. The management is
attending to the demands and will respond to the demands after the meeting this
afternoon," said Mkhize.
