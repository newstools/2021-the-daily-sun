THEY were called out for a noise complaint and found boozers going berserk at an illegal tavern. But when they tried to intervene, the drunkards turned on them. THEY HAD TO FLEE WHILE THE DRINKERS SET FIRE TO THEIR COP VAN! Cops found boozers having the time of their lives at an illegal shebeen in Muldersdrift in the West Rand. This despite level 1 regulations that prohibit the sale of alcohol after 11pm. The patrons told the cops to go back where they came from and bottles and stones were thrown at them.

When the officers finally managed to escape, they found that the mob had torched the state vehicle. Public order police arrived and managed to calm down the situation. The injured cop was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was treated and discharged. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters told Daily Sun the tavern owner was arrested and his liquor confiscated. He was released after paying an Admission of Guilt fine. Peters said a separate docket was opened for investigation in relation to the attack on police and malicious damage to property. Acting provincial police commissioner, Major-General Tommy Mthombeni, condemned the incident. “Our members who came under attack by this lawless group of people, who’re said to have been very aggressive, should actually be commended for sacrificing their safety and ensuring no member of the public got injured.” Peters added that four suspects have been arrested and are expected to make their first appearance today in the Krugersdorp Magistrate Court. “The two officers continue to receive support from the management of the SAPS as well as the Employee Health and Wellness units, and will return to work once they are declared ready to do so,” she said.
