IN SEPTEMBER last year, during lockdown, a fit club was formed by four people. That club has now grown to become a fully fledged gym with more than 50 members in Protea Glen, Soweto. According to Dineo Khunou (39), the club was formed out of a passion to help people get into the right shape and keep fit. “My dream is to see people live a healthier lifestyle. I’m also a Herbalife independent distributor, so I incorporated healthy eating while training. In that way you get results quickly,” she said. She said her goal is now becoming a reality as they have joined hands with other fitness clubs based in the kasis where they do bootcamps with different trainers. They get together to do activations in different communities. “I always had a dream to have my own gym and to change people’s lives, hence I joined Herbalife. Thanks to lockdown my dream is becoming a reality because more people are able to come out and exercise,” she said. She said not all boot camps are going to be free, as they plan to introduce family day picnics to have proper paid-for sessions.

Boot camps are not only concentrating on aerobics but they do functional training as well muscle build-up. “The more muscles you build the more fat you lose. In fact, functional training (squats, lunges, burpees and weight lifting) is more effective than cardio,” said Dineo. Her team uses GOG Lifestyle Protea Glen from Monday to Saturday from 5am to 8am.
