AN Iraqi boy was born with three penises. He’s the first child ever confirmed to have the strange irregularity, doctors have claimed. They believe they’re the first to ever publish a study detailing a case of human triphallia – when a person has three penises. Only one penis was functional, so the other two attached to the shaft of his actual penis and bottom of his scrotum were surgically removed. The unidentified boy was three months old when the story was first published last year. Doctors said one in every five to six million boys was born with more than one penis, with around 100 cases of diphallia – two penises – recorded worldwide. But the Iraqi boy is the first to have triphallia, according to the case published in the International Journal of Surgery Case Reports. According to the Daily Mail, one case in India went viral in 2015. But experts couldn’t verify the story because it was never detailed in a medical journal. Diphallia is an extraordinarily rare defect where a boy is born with two penises, with the first recorded case dating back to the 1600s. Triphallia is associated with other abnormalities, including being born with two scrotums or anuses. In most cases, the penises are the same size and sit side by side. A man with two penises can urinate or ejaculate from one or both, according to reports.
