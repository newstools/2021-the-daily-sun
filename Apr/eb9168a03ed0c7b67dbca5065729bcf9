MANQOBA Mngqithi is not selfish! With his side having gone 28 matches unbeaten, he has not been taking the credit alone. He made it clear that it’s team effort and recognizes everyone in the team, from backroom boys to the players. On Tuesday when his side came from 1-0 down to thrash Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila 3-1 at Peter Mokaba Stadium, the 49-year-old mentor praised his colleague Rhulani Mokwena for his tactical changes. Mngqithi disclosed that Mokwena was the reason behind Lyle Lakay and Thapelo Morena switching flanks in the second half, which saw the visitors score twice through Siphelele Mkhulise and Sibusiso Vilakazi, who were both founding the back of the net for the first time this season. "I am very impressed with the contribution of coach Rhulani," Mngqithi said after the game. "He suggested that let us try to invert our full back so that we can get proper diagonal because that is where the Mkhulise goal came from. Truth must be told, it was a perfect idea and it benefited us. Mngqithi, Steve Komphela, and Mokwena are serving as Sundowns’ co-coaches. Sundowns, have opened a six-point gap at the top of the DStv Premiership standings. They now shift their focus into the Caf Champions League. The Tshwane giants have already qualified for the quarter-finals of Africa's most prestigious club competition. They will play the final Group B match against CR Belouizdad at Loftus Stadium (3pm) this weekend.
