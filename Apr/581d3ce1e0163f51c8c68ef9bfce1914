GLADAFRICA Championship outfit Free State Stars veteran midfielder Paulus Masehe says he has no plans of retiring. The forgotten 37-year-old has been in the game for 20 years and believes he still has a few years left in the game. “I am enjoying playing football. To be honest, I have not yet started to think about retiring,” said the Qwa Qwa-born player. “I still feel fresh and am enjoying training every day. I am also using my experience to help the youngsters.” Masehe is one of the few players over 34 who are still playing in the professional ranks. Others are Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana (35), AmaZulu midfielder Simphiwe Tshabalala (36) and Sekhukhune United midfielder Jabu Maluleke (38). But former Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana star Tshabalala has played only a handful games for Usuthu. Masehe has also played for Orlando Pirates and Sundowns. Masehe won the PSL title with the Brazilians in 2006 and lifted the Nedbank Cup with Stars in 2018. This is Masehe’s 13th season at Stars after he joined them in 2008 from Bucs. Masehe says his goal for this season is to see the Free State side return to the top flight. It has been two seasons since Ea Lla Koto were relegated to the Championship.
