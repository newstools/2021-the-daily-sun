MPUMALANGA Hawks are appealing to victims who paid money to a 40-year-old court interpreter to make cases disappear off the court role to come forward. The interpreter, who is stationed in Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, was arrested and charged with corruption on Friday, 16 April. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said between January and last month, the suspect allegedly approached an accused that was out on bail for two domestic violence cases and asked for money claiming he’d ensure the cases were withdrawn. “The victim paid the money but the case was not withdrawn,” she said. She said he continued asking for money from the victim saying he needed to pay the prosecutor for the docket to be destroyed. “The victim kept paying, but the case kept being postponed. The victim alerted the Hawks and the investigation led to the interpreter’s arrest.” She said the victim’s case of domestic violence is still on the court roll and he will appear until the matter is finalised. “A second victim came to court to report that the same official had allegedly demanded money from her to have her case withdrawn which also never happened.” Sekgotodi said they believed the suspect may have been taking people’s money for a while. Victims are urged to contact investigating officer Captain Luzile Ndlovu on 071 481 2819. The suspect is expected to appear in Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court today, 19 April.
