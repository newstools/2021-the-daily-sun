SOCCER players are famous for having taste for the finer things in life. Their houses, cars and accessories are normally of the highest quality. And with the amount of money they are paid, they can afford just about everything they like. However, some footballers prefer the more humble approach despite having the means to afford the best things. AmaZulu’s Xola Mlambo is one of those players. The 29-tear-old does have some eye-catching rides in his garage, but he has described a modest bakkie as his “dream car.” He recently shared a photo of himself next to the vehicle on social media.
