MADLANDUNA and Zandile Luthuli, the children of maskandi artist Bhekumuzi Luthuli, are angry at Sabelo “Shumilezinsizwa” Mncwabe. They claim he had an interview on Ukhozi FM on 7 April, where he said he had worked with their father, but that had never happened. “We are angry and hurt that Shumilezinsizwa is using my father’s name to gain popularity. “He has never worked with my father or met him. People who worked with him include Thuthukani Cele and Gearbox ‘Abafana bakamolo’ Mtshali,” said Madlanduna. Zandile told Daily Sun they wanted Shumilezinsizwa to retract his statement. But Thuthukani disputed Madlanduna and Zandile’s version. “I also worked with their father. I listened to the interview, and Shumilezinsizwa never said he had worked with Bhekumuzi.

As a result, Shumilezinsizwa ended up loving it. “He then located artists who worked with Bhekumuzi and found us,” he said. Gearbox said: “I also listened to the interview and Shumilezinsizwa never said he worked with Bhekumuzi. He only emphasised that his music was inspired by him.” Shumilezinsizwa said: “There is nothing to correct. I am not going to apologise because I never claimed to have worked with Bhekumuzi. I said I loved his music.” Daily Sun also listened to the clip and Shumilezinsizwa never claimed to have worked with Bhekumuzi. “My father was a big fan of Bhekumuzi. He introduced me to his music. Fortunately, I’ve had the privilege of working with people who used to work with him,” Shumilezinsizwa said in the interview. Acting SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said: “The SABC can confirm that Bhekumuzi’s son unfortunately heard wrong. “The guest did not claim to have worked with the late legend. “Should he require the audio, he can contact Ukhozi FM management.”
