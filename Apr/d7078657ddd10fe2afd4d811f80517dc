THE political life of DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela is under threat as the opposition and some party members want him out. This comes after an article by Daily Maverick that said he wrote in his biography he obtained a BCom in human resources management when in fact he didn’t complete it. ANC’s provincial leader Cameron Dugmore came out guns blazing calling for Premier Allan Winde to immediately suspend Madikizela pending an investigation. Madikizela’s currently the MEC for transport and public works. “We cannot have an MEC going about his business with such a serious cloud hanging over his head. “Madikizela is alleged to have claimed he has a BCom degree on the CV he submitted to the DA regarding his application to be considered as a mayoral candidate for the City of Cape Town,” said Dugmore. Meanwhile, DA Federal Council chairwoman Helen Zille said the matter was referred to the party’s Federal Legal Commission. “The DA regards this in a serious light and will follow due process in establishing the facts and taking consequent follow-up action,” said Zille. Madikizela confirmed he didn’t complete the degree, but stated that a degree was not a requirement for all the positions he held. “In light of the Daily Maverick article, I take full responsibility that I didn’t correct the information on my bio. It is true, I didn’t finish my Bcom degree, but that is not a requirement for a political office in South Africa. This didn’t benefit me in any way in the positions I’m currently occupying, that I previously applied for (premiership) and the position I’ve applied for (mayor) as it was never a requirement.” A DA insider told Daily Sun Madikizela made a mistake by throwing his name in the hat for the mayoral position. “There are top guys from the party who don’t want him there and they will play dirty to ensure he’s out, not only from the mayoral race but the party altogether.”
