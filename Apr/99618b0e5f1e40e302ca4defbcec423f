CONSTABLE Mfowabo Sithole’s daughter was brutally murdered in Malibu Village, Blue Downs, in Cape Town. Sithole told Daily Sun he believes cops failed his daughter. “As cops, we failed my daughter because neighbours reported the incident while my daughter was being attacked by her boyfriend,” said Sithole. His wife, Nomlindo Sithole, said her daughter Sesethu (23) was killed with a golf stick. “My daughter’s boyfriend is a monster. He killed my daughter with a gold stick, and left her seven-day-old baby on top of a dead body,” said Sithole. She said if cops had gone to the boyfriend’s house, her daughter could’ve still been alive. “They were called around 11pm by neighbours but they never showed up. Then they were again when they started fighting again around 4am. We were shocked to hear those police officers who were sent to the house lied by saying nothing is happening there, while my daughter was being killed like a dog,” she said. Sesethu was supposed to visit the hospital for her check-up as she had given birth by C-section. “My daughter had an operation from giving birth to the suspect’s baby. What he did to his baby is unforgivable. “How could he be so heartless by putting his baby on top of a dead body?” asked Sithole. She said her wish is that Sesethu’s death would change how police officers did their jobs. “Let my child’s death be the call to cops to start taking their jobs seriously. When they are called, they need to make sure they arrive at the address instead of lying. By doing so, a lot of lives could be saved,” she said. Captain FC van Wyk said a 26-year old suspect was arrested in KTC Gugulethu on Monday, 26 April. He appeared in the Blue Down Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 28 April. He said preliminary investigations revealed cops did receive the complaint on the morning of the incident. “Two members were identified and disciplinary files have been opened against them for investigation purposes,” said Van Wyk.
