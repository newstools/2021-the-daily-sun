The South African Reserve Bank has seized R19 million from Sahara Computers, owned by the Guptas. The Reserve Bank gazetted the forfeiture on Wednesday, 31 March under the virtue of the provisions of Exchange Control Regulation. The money that has been seized by the bank will be deposited into the National Revenue Fund according to the forfeiture rules. In the Gazette, SARB deputy governor Kuben Naidoo said: “By the functions, powers vested in me, in my capacity as the deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank, I hereby give notice of a decision to forfeit to the state the following money and I hereby declare and order forfeit to the state the following money.” Naidoo said the amount of R19 669 000 standing to the credit of Sahara Computers, together with any interest thereon or any other accrual thereto is hereby forfeited to the state. He said this notice also constituted a written order, as contemplated in Exchange Control Regulation 22B. The IT company owned by the Gupta brothers shut its doors in 2018 and former president Jacob Zuma’s children Duduzane and Duduzile were employees of the company.
