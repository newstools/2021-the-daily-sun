GOLDEN Arrows coach Mandla Ncikazi feels his team is “being disrespected” and don’t get the same recognition as the other PSL sides. Ncikazi, whose side has continued to punch their weight, despite the limited resources, had frustration written all over his face after his side earned a massive point against log leaders, Mamelodi Sundowns, at Loftus Stadium Wednesday. “With the hype around AmaZulu, you’d think they already have the result even before we play,” said Ncikazi, ahead of the Durban Derby coming against AmaZulu at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday (3pm). “You look at the amount of disrespect they give to Arrows and the hype they create around AmaZulu. You'd even think some of the work for AmaZulu. We are not a celebrity team. But having said that, we will continue working hard.” Usuthu have been busy giving their jerseys to various celebrities in Durban such as Terry Pheto and DJ Tira. On Wednesday AmaZulu management also handed a jersey to the Durban mayor Mxolisi Kaunda. “We don’t have celebrity coaches. We are a humble group that is continuing to work hard and humbly so.” The goalless draw against Sundowns somewhat helped AmaZulu close the gap at the top, as they thumped Cape Town City 5-1 at Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday. Benni McCarthy’s boys are now breathing down Sundowns' neck as they move to 47 points after 25 games, one behind Sundowns, who have two games in hand. Ncikazi’s side remain third on 43 points after 25 matches, four points behind AmaZulu and five behind Sundowns.   Ncikazi added they were within reach of their goal of taking the team to their highest ever position this season.   “We are still on course to achieve our goal. We are running our own race. All the noise that is around the other teams, we don’t concentrate on that, but on ourselves.”
