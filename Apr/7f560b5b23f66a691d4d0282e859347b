FREEDOM Day will always be synonymous with Nelson Mandela and everything that the late elder statesman represented. It wasn’t long after South Africans had cast their votes that he was inaugurated as South Africa’s first democratically elected president. And what a day that was when hundreds of thousands witnessed the momentous occasion at Union Building. Madiba was then flown by helicopter to Ellis Park to sprinkle his Madiba magic as Bafana Bafana took on Zambia in the inaugural Nelson Mandela Challenge. Needless to mention South Africa won the friendly encounter 2-1 and capped what had been a memorable day for the country. Brendan Augustine opened the scoring while Doctor Khumalo added the second before Linos Makwaza pulled one back for Chipolopolo. Mamelodi Sundowns coach Steve Komphela captained Bafana on the day. Edwin Senai of Botswana was the referee. Bafana Bafana line-up: Steve Crowley, Sizwe Motaung, Lucas Radebe, Steve Komphela (c), Neil Tovey, Rudolph Seale, John Moshoeu (Marks Maponyane 70), Doctor Khumalo, Mark Fish, Brendan Augustine (David Nyathi 79), Phil Masinga. Coach: Clive Barker.
