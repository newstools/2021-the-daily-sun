SUPERSPORT United have suffered an injury ahead of their DStv Premiership match against Golden Arrows at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday (5pm). Matsatsantsa A Pitori will play without captain Ronwen Williams, winger Gamphani Lungu, prolific goalscorers Thamsanqa Gabuza and Bradley Grobler. And Bafana Bafana midfielder Sipho Mbule has yet to pass a late fitness test due to illness. Williams has always been present in SuperSport’s goal posts, having not missed a single game since February 2018. On the other hand, Gabuza and Grobler’s absence could cause a big headache for SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo since they have scored the most (19) goals for the club in the league this season. Said Tembo: “This will be a tough game. Arrows have done well to be where they are at the moment. Credit to coach Mandla Ncikazi who has made them to play good football. It’s not easy for us as we had disappointing results (3-0 league defeat) against Cape Town City in our last match. We have prepared well, but we have an injury snag with Ronwen, Bradley, Gabuza and Lungu out. Sipho might go for a late fitness test and we hope he will recover before the game.” Tembo is confident fringe players George Chigova and Boalefa Pule will raise the bar in Williams’ absence to help the Tshwane giants return to winning ways and keep up with title chasers.
