Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivandila will battle it out for Nedbank Cup honour with Chippa United on 8 May at a venue to be confirmed.  The Limpopo side caused a major upset as they knocked Mamelodi Sundowns out of the cup with 6-5 penalty shoot-out win, following a goalless draw at Loftus Stadium yesterday. Sundowns were expected to walk eye-closed into the finals, having cruised into the semifinals with an emphatic 4-1 win over Orlando Pirates.  But far from it. The coaching trio of Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and Steve Komphela was matched by TTM’s counterparts; Mpho Maleka, David Mathebula and Dylan Kerr, watching from the stands.  In fact, the unheralded TTM had three clear cut chances, which could have easily won them the game in regulation time.  Perhaps fatigue kept crept in, Sundowns coming off an epic battle against Bucs just a few days ago.  It was their third game in seven days and that took its toll.  Themba Zwane wasn’t as majestic as he was against Bucs, missing a clear chance in the second half.  They had more than 10 attempts at goal, substitute Sibusiso Vilakazi denied by Washington Arubi with a brilliant save late.  The in-form TTM goalie also parried away Lyle Lakay’s freekick in extra time while Peter Shalulile, who was kept quiet by defender Alfred Ndengane, was also denied by the outstanding 35-year-old Arubi.  Arubi denied Hlompho Kekana in the penalties, ensuring TTM through.
