Dear MizzB MY girlfriend is 18 weeks pregnant with our first child. My problem is that she refuses to have sex with me. Is there any possibility that I could hurt the unborn baby during sex? Dear Brother Having sex during pregnancy is completely normal, unless there are complications which a doctor or nurse noticed and advised her to stop having sex. Fear of the foetus being hurt during sex is common, especially for first-time parents. It would help if you can make time to accompany your girlfriend to her antenatal check-ups. This will give you the opportunity to talk to the nurse or doctor and get more clarity when it comes to pregnancy and hormonal changes. Be supportive at all times. Best of luck!
