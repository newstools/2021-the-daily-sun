Allow me to take you back to the year 2005. If you know your music trivia, then you would remember a South African hip hop group called Hidden Force. The group dropped one of their biggest records called Because I was drunk that year. The song seeks to justify our behaviour under the influence of alcohol. Despite my love for the song, alcohol is always meant to be consumed responsibly. However, according to a 2019 and 2020 report compiled by the World Health Organisation, there are countries around the world that are drinking alcohol excessively. The report compiled a ranked list of the countries that just love to drink. The data comes from the WHOâ€™s harmful use of alcohol data. The report highlighted that Eastern Europe loves to drink. The Koreans love their sake, the Finnish love their vodka, Germans love their beer and Eastern Europeans just love anything that contains alcohol. These are the top 10 drunk nations according to the average consumption per litre: 1. Moldova 15,2 litres 2. Lithuania 15 litres 3. Czech Republic 14,4 litres 4. Germany 13,4 litres 5. Nigeria 13,4 litres 6. Ireland 13 litres 7. Latvia 12,9 litres 8. Bulgaria 12,7 litres 9. France 12,6 litres 10. Portugal 12,3 litres
