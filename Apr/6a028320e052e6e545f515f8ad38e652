Nkholo Seanego (37), also known as Dr Sangoma, is a qualified doctor and
trained sangoma. Seanego
denied his ancestral gift for a long time but eventually couldn’t anymore. He said
soon after birth it was revealed to his parents he carried the gift of his
great-grandfather and was to be named after him. At the age
of eight he could foresee things before they happened. “My parents
did an ancestral ritual so I could focus on my schooling, and for some years it
worked,” he said. After
matric he studied medicine in Cuba. “I was
practising as a medical doctor and married with kids when I lost everything. “I come
from a family of traditional healers, but society taught me izangoma are bad. “Then I
realised they wanted my attention. I had no choice but to give it to them.” He said
when he went for training, he learnt that izangoma were just ordinary people
with a gift to heal. He learnt that medical and traditional doctors could
coexist. Seanego
said he’s been doing his job as a medical doctor quite well since he accepted
his calling. “Every day
before I go to work I communicate with my
ancestors to guide me,” he said. “Even when
I’m going to perform surgery they guide me.”
