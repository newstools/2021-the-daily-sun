The dark clouds of Covid-19 that befell the whole world have left many of us feeling its wrath. We’ve lost loved ones and livelihoods. The government’s relief fund has, however, been assisting to avert life’s struggles. It’s highly irresponsible of people to be greedy and use underhand methods to benefit more than they should at the expense of others. The National Arts Council grant was meant for all struggling artists to put bread on the table. It’s despicable for one to claim relief grants by using different organisations or relatives to claim over and over again, to the detriment of colleagues in the industry. It was very touching to see artists marching and staging sit-ins day and night at the council offices to bring attention to their plight. It will only be fair that all artists benefit equally, without fear or favour. I’m hoping and trusting those who abused the system will be brought to book. ) Kabedi Ramosa Joburg
