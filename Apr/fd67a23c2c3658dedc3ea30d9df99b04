Beware of dubious forex brokers who scam people. More and more consumers are falling prey to forex trading scams in South Africa. People are losing their investments through scammers from so-called forex companies. Many are being swindled out of their hard-earned cash by unregulated, illegal online trading brokers who promise them a good return on their investment. When itâ€™s time for repayments, these companies send investors from pillar to post. Forex trading have emerged as the most lucrative scams for criminals in recent months, according to security experts. Unlicensed, unregulated online trading scams are nothing more than video games intended to convince consumers that they are real. Scammers are taking advantage of inexperienced traders. These charlatans take advantage of the complexities around the forex market, maliciously withholding important information about market realities from their unsuspecting novice victims. - Letter by Nelson Kgatla, Pretoria North
