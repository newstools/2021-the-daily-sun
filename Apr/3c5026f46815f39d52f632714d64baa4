Mamelodi Sundowns coach, Manqoba Mngqithi, has praised Gift Motupa on his first start for the Brazilians. Unfortunately, Motupa made his first start in the Brazilians colours in a historic loss to Kaizer Chiefs, going down 2-1 in a highly hyped-up DStv Premiership at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Sunday. Motupa was all over the place and at the right time when Sundowns first took the lead through a Gaston Sirino goal. But Chiefs had other ideas as they pumped two quick goals within minutes, which completely tore Sundowns apart. This was Sundowns' first loss in the league in as many matches, their first also this season. "I was impressed with his performance," Mngqithi said after the match where he was turning 50. "He had a great game. He contributed immensely. Even in the goal that we scored, I can credit him too, he was instrumental and very composed in that moment. Personally I think it was a very good start for him, and it opens up other opportunities for him in the future to get other starts. "He had a very good run for somebody who never started until he got those cramped that made us make the decision not to prolong this any further, because we didn't want to lose him. "He worked very hard. He had some good moments for moments." Sundowns are next against Golden Arrows at home in Pretoria on Wednesday.
