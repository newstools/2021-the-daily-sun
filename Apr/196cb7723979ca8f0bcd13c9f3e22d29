BANYANA Banyana’s record is better than that of Bafana Bafana since the SA Football Association (Safa) was readmitted into international football in 1992.  When Bafana were readmitted to Fifa that year, they were ranked 124th and when Fifa started the women’s ranking in 2003, Banyana were in 62nd position. From 2004 to 2007, Banyana were ranked 73rd, 72nd, 71st and 74th respectively. Banyana’s 74th is the lowest they have been ranked while Bafana’s lowest was 124th (1992) and 87th in 2012.   Bafana, who were ranked 71st for the past three years, have slipped four spots after failing to qualify for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals. According to the latest Fifa rankings, Bafana are now ranked 75th while their average is 54. Banyana are currently ranked 53rd and their average position is 59 since Fifa created the rankings.   Having beating Zambia and Botswana in the two recent friendly matches, Banyana’s rankings are set to improve as Fifa has not updated the women’s rankings since last December. Bafana’s highest ranking was 19 in 1996, after they claimed the Afcon title while Banyana’s highest was 48th three years ago.  On the continent, Bafana are ranked 15th while Banyana are ranked third.  Bafana last qualified for the Fifa World Cup in 2002 and Banyana in 2019.  Neither national team have gone beyond the group stages in the World Cup finals.
