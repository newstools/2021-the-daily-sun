TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila coach Mpho Maleka felt his charges showed Mamelodi Sundowns too much respect in their 3-1 DStv Premiership defeat. Vhadau Vha Damani were the first to find the back of the net in a match played at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday afternoon, but they failed to manage the game as the visitors came back from behind to score three goals. Thembinkosi Nevhlamba scored for TTM, and all Sundowns' goals came from players who were scoring their first goals of the 2020-21 season, Siphelele Mkhulise, Rivaldo Coetzee, and Sibusiso Vilakazi. The result means Sundowns have now opened a six-point gap at the top of the standings. The Brazilians have 43 points ahead of second-placed Golden Arrows as they stay on course for a fourth straight league title. Maleka said: "We started very slow. We gave Sundowns too much respect. "We planned to stay compact, and we did but our pressing was very slow. We gave ourselves a path at the back by scoring one brilliant goal. But we let ourselves down. We did not do what we have planned. TTM are second from the bottom of the table with 16 points after 20 matches. With games coming thick and fast as we are heading towards the end of the season, TTM are under immense pressure to move from where they are sitting on the log standings. Maleka added: "They were some questionable decisions. But the guys did well. Now we have to dust ourselves out and go fight again when we face TS Galaxy."
