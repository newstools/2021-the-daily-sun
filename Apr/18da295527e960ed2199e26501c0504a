MPUMALANGA police have launched a manhunt for suspects who killed a security guard during an attempted cash-in-transit robbery. The armed suspects tried to collide with the escort guard’s bakkie and one guard was hit by a bullet while his colleagues sustained gunshot wounds on Thursday, 8 April. Police spokeswoman Colonel Brenda Muridili told Daily Sun that a group of unknown suspects attempted to rob a cash-in-transit vehicle on the R536 Kruger Roads next to Sabie River Bridge.  “Two security guards from the escort bakkie were allegedly shot by the suspects. One died on the scene and another one was taken to hospital for medical attention. The cash van was not affected as it was driving in front of the escort bakkie. "Cases of attempted cash-in-transit robbery and murder are being investigated. No arrests have been made but a massive manhunt has been launched.  "We want to urge anyone with information on the whereabouts of the suspects to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or send information via MYSAPSAPP. All received information will be treated as confidential and callers may remain anonymous,” said Muridili.
