THE Zulu royal house has started secret preparations for the coronation of the new king. This despite the royal house telling the nation it would first mourn late king, Goodwill Zwelithini, for three months. A secret meeting was held on Saturday, 17 April, where a committee to advise the new king was appointed. It was held in Ulundi, northern KZN, and not at KwaKhethomthandayo Royal Palace in Nongoma where meetings are normally held. Zwelithini’s brother Prince Mbonisi, who was also his adviser, was appointed as the new king’s adviser and leader of the advisory committee. An insider told Daily Sun the committee was formed because Prince Misuzulu Zulu (48), who’ll be the next king, is young and doesn’t have knowledge of the throne. “The advising committee will help provide the new king with guidelines and teach other princes and princesses about the throne,” said the insider. “The new king will learn many things from Prince Mbonisi because he advised King Zwelithini for a long time and has more knowledge about the monarchy.” Other members of the committee included Zwelithini’s sister Princess Thembi Ndlovu and his aunt Princess Thulubheke Thabethe. The insider said another special meeting will be held on Saturday, 24 April, to finalise the coronation. “They didn’t finalise it on Saturday because the regent, Queen Mantfombi MaDlamini Zulu, was not part of the meeting. She was in hospital because she’s been ill for a long time. But there’s hope she’ll be discharged soon,” said the insider. “The king’s other children were also not part of the meeting, but have been invited to the next one.” Mbonisi confirmed to Daily Sun that the royal house held a secret meeting on Saturday. “But many things were not finalised and I’m not comfortable to talk about it,” he said. “We’ll have another meeting on Saturday to finalise everything. We’ll comment after that.”
