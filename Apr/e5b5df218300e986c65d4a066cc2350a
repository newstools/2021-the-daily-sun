TRADITIONAL gospel singer Themba Mashiane uses music to deal with pain. He said music is like therapy for him and his mum, Agnes. “I grew up in an squatter camp. During rainy days, my mum would cover me with a zinc bath and stand up until it stops. Once it stopped, we would play music from Dr Rebecca Malope, the late Vuyo Mokoena and Lundi Tyamara,” said the 32-year-old singer from Maokeng section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. “We sang along. That is how we comforted each other. We believed and hoped that one day things would be alright.” Themba started singing at school until he joined the popular clap-and-tap gospel group, The Blue Train, Lejwe la Motheo, from Tembisa, led by Tebogo Chauke.
