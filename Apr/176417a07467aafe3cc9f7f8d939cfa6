FORMER Transnet CFO Anoj Singh described his visits to Dubai, which happened at the same time as the Guptas’, as a coincidence. Singh told the Zondo Commission on Thursday, 22 April, he wasn’t even aware they were there. According to evidence before Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, Anoj Singh travelled to Dubai six times between 2014 and 2015. He used Travel Excellence, the same agency used by Gupta lieutenant Salim Essa and Sahara Computers, for bookings. Singh claimed the trips were all private and personal, and that he paid for them. “We question the authenticity of these documents,” said Singh. ALSO READ: HAWKS
CONFIRM HERITAGE FUND CASE! Evidence leader Anton Myburgh read that according to the Gupta leaks, on one occasion he was in the same hotel when his accommodation was charged on Essa’s MasterCard. But he said the Singh in the invoice was Anuj, not Anoj. “This is not me,” said Singh. He couldn’t explain how he ended up with the relatively unknown travel agency. “I don’t recall how I ended up with them.” In one of his stays, he paid an equivalent of R60 000 in cash for accommodation at a hotel. He said he used cash because Dubai was safer than South Africa. According to evidence by witness 3, who was also Singh’s driver, Singh collected a bag of cash from the Gupta residence and went to the Knox Vault building. He said he kept his wife’s jewellery, and cash he got through gambling and moonlighting, in eight boxes. He denied he took any money from the Guptas. According to Knox Vaults’ access records, Singh visited the building on 22 occasions between July 2013 and August 2017.
