NTUTHUKO Shoba is confident the state does not have a strong case against him, and would therefore plead not guilty. This was read by his defence lawyer, Shady Sithole, during his second bail application, providing the court with new evidence. This is the second set of evidence brought forward to strengthen Shoba’s plea for bail. Shoba is facing a charge of premeditated murder after Muzikayise Malephane implicated him as the alleged mastermind in the murder of Tshegofatso Pule. Shoba is alleged to be the mastermind behind the murder of his girlfriend Tshegofatso Pule, who was heavily pregnant at the time. Shoba explained that his sick grandmother depended on him. “I have an 80-year-old grandmother, whose medical expenses are my responsibility,” he said. He said he had been co-operative from the day he received the news that Tshegofatso Pule was missing. “I voluntarily went to the police station to offer my help. I explained we were together, shared supper and made a list of things to buy for the baby over the weekend. “At the time, she was busy texting on her phone and I had work to do. When it was time for me to request transport for her, she said she was sorted,” said Shoba. He claimed he then walked her to the gate and she walked toward a car. “I did not see the driver, but heard Tshego ask him who the car belonged to. After a short argument they drove off. “I even helped the police request footage from where I live and they saw what happened.” Shoba emphasised that he wouldn’t have paid for Tshego’s expenses if he had ill intentions. “I paid for her doctor’s visits and vitamins. I went with her to some of her appointments and if not, paid for transport. I was excited to be a new dad as I have no children of my own. Shoba told the court he was not a flight risk and was willing to give up his pension fund as surety. The NPA’s Phindile Mjonondwane said the state needed time to go over the new evidence. The case was postponed to 22 April.
