LIGHTNING has brought nothing but misery for a 62-year-old madala from the Sogedleni area in Nongoma, northern KZN. This comes after it killed his seven cows, leaving him with only three calves which he said could also die. Simon Buthelezi told Daily Sun in the early hours of Saturday morning, while they were all sleeping, the weather started to change. “It started making scary lightning strikes, but we didn’t pay much attention because we never thought it was causing any harm,” said Simon. He said when he went to his kraal in the morning to let his cows out to graze, he found them lying on the ground. “The kraal and a tree close by were messed up. I concluded the whole mess was done by lightning,” he said. He said the three calves that survived were kept in another kraal which has shelter since they are still small. “That’s how they were spared. If they were kept in the kraal where the rest of the cows were kept they would have also died,” he said. The madala said he fears his calves will die. “I need to buy them milk for a good five months before they’re able to feed themselves on grass. I don’t have that kind of money so I think they, too, will eventually die,” said Simon. He said having cows in his home helped him look after his family. “I’ld sell one or two after a few months and I’d be able to buy my family food, clothes and other basic needs. Now that I’ve lost everything I don’t know what to do next,” said Simon. He said he has a wife, seven kids and two grandchildren. He said no one is employed in his home and some of the kids are still in school. KZN agriculture spokesman Vusi Zuma said: “Unfortunately, this year due to Covid-19 the department didn’t set aside funds to assist victims of natural disasters. But we do sympathise with the victim. We can advise him to visit our local office to see how we can assist in terms of giving him feed for his calves.”
