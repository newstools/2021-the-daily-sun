ITHEMBA Musical Group’s remaining members asked for a special prayer during the funeral service of their slain member, Sfiso “Mkhaya” Dladla. Dladla’s funeral was held at Imbalemhle Community Hall in G Section in Umlazi, south of Durban, on Wednesday 31 March. This comes after he succumbed to his injuries after being shot on 24 March. He had been fighting for his life since 14 March at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi. He was rushed to hospital a short while after he was shot eight times in the home of the alleged thugs that he and other Community Policing Forum members had gone to confront. According to group member, Thabani Mnyandu, Dladla was also a member of the CPF.

Thabani said they need prayer because they don’t understand what is happening to the group. “In 2009, Amen Mkhanyawo was shot and killed when thugs stormed his home in N Section in Umlazi. In 2010, Sfiso Mzulwini was mistakenly shot and killed when a certain thugs was being sought but Mzulwini ended up being the one who was shot and killed. Now Sfiso Dladla is the latest member who has been shot and killed by local thugs,” said Thabani. He said it was scary that all Ithemba members were being killing in the same manner. “It looks like there is a curse hovering over our heads as Ithemba members. Whenever an Ithemba member is dies, it is through the gun. This why we’re asking for prayers,” said Thabani. He said they believed prayer could break this curse.
