SHE received death threats from her boyfriend. So, Ubenathi Tshijila ran home and locked herself inside. But this did not stop her boyfriend from pursuing the 17-year-old. He then allegedly hacked the door with an axe. Fighting to save her life, Ubenathi pushed the fridge, table and kitchen cabinet against the door to stop him from gaining entry. But he still found his way in and dragged her out. Ubenathi from Rondebult, Ekurhuleni, was found dead in the street on Tuesday 13 April. There was an open gash on her forehead. The boyfriend has been arrested for her murder. Ubenathi’s gogo Nowinile Tshijila (69), who raised her, said she was heartbroken by her death. She said that she prayed the boyfriend could tell the truth. “He definitely knows what happened. He had bruises on his hands and blood on his clothes,” she said. Community leader Zola Nongogo said they were concerned about the rising violence against women in the area. “We receive a number of cases of women who are killed and raped by their partners, which is worrying,” said Zola. He said that this past weekend, another woman was also found lying on the street, hacked to death. “Rondebult is becoming a scary place, and we wish the people doing this are found.” A murder case was opened at Elsburg Police Station and the suspect appeared in court last week. He will make his second appearance soon. Ubenathi was buried in Eastern Cape on Sunday, 18 April.
