SEVERAL RESIDENTS of Emdeni and other kasis in Soweto marched against the brutal killing of Jostina Sangweni yesterday. Mkhulu Themba Thwala from the Traditional Healers’ Association said people were touched by mama Jostina’s death. “It’s not only izangoma and the family who are in pain, it’s the whole community. “We’re here to say it ends today and no one should label someone as umthakathi without evidence. People need to learn about mental illness, because one day it will be their family member and I doubt they will be happy if they are killed,” said Thwala. The EFF’s Thoko Zwane said the march was not about any political party, but about sending a message that gender-based violence wouldn’t be tolerated. “We joined hands with the ANC and izangoma to say no to acts of brutality from one human to another. I don’t believe in ubuthakathi. I don’t understand how it works. People need to do their research and listen when a person pleads with them. Don’t people have hearts anymore?” Resident Ntombi Mbhele said the community was angry. “If it were up to us, the suspects’ house would be on the ground but the family begged us not to seek revenge and we will listen. Mama Jostina wasn’t a loud person, so I’m sure she wouldn’t want violence.” Jostina was brutally beaten and burnt in March after she was found in someone’s yard. On Friday, 9 April two suspects were bust for her murder and appeared in Protea Magistrates Court on Monday. They were denied bail. Her funeral will be held at her home in Emdeni on Saturday.
