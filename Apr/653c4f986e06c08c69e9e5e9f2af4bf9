Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has lost the love for the game. This is according to Amakhosi coach Gavin Hunt who believes that the injuries, the loss of form and the recent trauma of losing his sister are the cause. Khune has been going through a difficult time and this led to him losing the captaincy which went to Ramahlwe Mphahlele. He was in goals when Chiefs lost 4-0 to Wydad Athletic Club in the second group stage match of the Caf Champions League played at the neutral venue at Stade Du 04 Aout, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso in February. The experienced shot stopper was singled out and made a mockery when the entire team should have taken the blame. Following the death of his sister, Khune missed two Champions League matches against Petro De Luanda, as well as two league matches against Maritzburg United and Orlando Pirates which came before the international break. However, he was in the stands in the Soweto Derby win and joined the national team camp as Bafana were preparing two crucial African Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan respectively. Khune came on in a win 1-0 over Wydad, penultimate Champions League group stages, at FNB Stadium on Saturday after Daniel Akpeyi was sent off for handling the ball outside his line. “Khune’s had a hell of a time in his life, with what’s happened,” Hunt said. “But he’s one who, I can see he’s coming back mentally. I always felt Itu’s problem – and I’ve said it to him, I don’t hide it – is that I think he fell out of love with the game. You’ve got to love the game. “And sometimes it happens in football, and what happened to him off the field is tragic. “You’ve got to go to training every day and love it. We’ve spoken about it, we speak about it.
