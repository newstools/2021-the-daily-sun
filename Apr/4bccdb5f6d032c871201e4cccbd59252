A VIDEO taken at the Old Apostolic Church in Mdantsane, Eastern Cape, has gone viral. It shows a senior church member pushing and shoving another member at the gate of the church. The member was allegedly late for service. Even though other members who were late ended up going home, one man, who was in the company of a woman and a toddler, refused and started forcing his way in. The scuffle goes on for three minute before the elderly man finally stops wrestling. At the end of the confrontation, the gate was forced off its railing as a result of the scuffle. The elderly member, who refused entry to the couple who came late, can be heard saying: “God loves you. You are blessed, beloved, but you will not get in. You are not going to get inside. I told you to go home.” This happened in a church in Mdantsane NU8 this morning, the brethren were late pic.twitter.com/YjtiJPTtTa  Church member Daniel Mvundla relayed the story to Daily Sun. “It was announced in church that late coming would not be tolerated and the gate would be closed after 11am. The older man was tasked to close the gate at the specified time and to not allow anyone inside. He was just doing what he was instructed to do by the pastor,” Mvundla said. “The younger member was 15 minutes late and he tried to reason that it was because of traffic congestion. But his pleas fell on deaf ears.” Mvundla said the gate was being closed at 11am to allow time for members to be screened for Covid-19. “What happened this Sunday has now caused an internal investigation because some church members support the young man, while others are against the incident. The church is divided on the matter.”
