PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will no longer appear at the Zondo Commission on 22 April. On Wednesday, 14 April, it was announced that his dates have been moved after he requested to have his evidence heard at a later date. He was scheduled to give evidence in his capacity as the president of the ANC on 22 and 23 April and come back on the 28th and 29th in his capacity as president of Mzansi. “That has changed in part because the president made a request in connection with dates of 22 and 23 April because of some commitments that had arisen. “I have acceded to the request to change those dates,” said chairman of the commission Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. He said Ramaphosa would still appear on 28 and 29 April in his capacity as president of the ANC and again on 13 and 14 May in his capacity as president of Mzansi. Ramaphosa had made commitments that he would appear before the commission on the dates announced by Zondo on 24 March. The commission is continuing hearing parliamentary oversight-related evidence from ANC national chairman and former secretary-general Gwede Mantashe.
