We usually learn to do things better from our previous mistakes. So, as parents, we should allow our kids to learn from their mistakes. We shouldn’t be furious at them when they do things wrong because making mistakes is a learning curve. We should politely encourage them not to be afraid to learn new things just because they fear they’ll fail or make mistakes. We should tell them to identify their mistakes and learn from them. - Letter by Andries Roro Kabini, Rockville
