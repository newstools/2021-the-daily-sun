NDINITHANDA nonke emakhaya! Mzansi heard these words for the last time on Tuesday, 30 March when veteran isiXhosa newsreader Noxolo Grootboom read her final news bulletin after 37 years. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mam’Noxolo said she felt she has fully served her purpose. “I don’t know how to explain what I’m feeling, but this has made me rich in every way possible. “There’s nothing I regret in the past 37 years. My heart is fulfilled. I did what I had to do and Mzansi has shown me that I tried my best. The encouragement I’ve received from people, especially youngsters, has shown me that the past 37 years were not wasted,” she said. Mam’Noxolo said her last bulletin on Tuesday was the hardest she had ever done. “I was overcome with guilt the moment I greeted people at the beginning of the bulletin. I felt like a parent abandoning her child. It was so painful, I don’t know how I finished that 30 minutes. It was like betraying isiXhosa.

On top of that, the president moved his address from 7pm to 7.30pm so people could watch me. That was big. He killed me with that one!” She said she would dedicate the first three months of her retirement to her family. “I want to show them how grateful I am for their persistence when I worked crazy shifts. “I missed great moments with my kids. More than anything else, I want to show my husband how grateful I am for his maintaining my dignity as Mrs Grootboom,” she said.
