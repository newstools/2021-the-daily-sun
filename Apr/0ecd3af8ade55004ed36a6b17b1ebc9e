KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has made a huge promise to the club’s management and supporters. The 56-year-old, who has had a rather tough start to life at Naturena, insists he has what it takes to turn the corner. He has admitted that it has been a baptism of fire for him in his debut campaign with the Glamour Boys. But he reckons tough times will not last and he will soon get Amakhosi firing on all cylinders. Hunt‚ who has won four league titles and numerous cup competitions at different clubs‚ has promised more silverware during his tenure at Chiefs. “The club has brought me here to win trophies and they will win trophies with me,” said Hunt. “What we need to do is to look at our squad going forward. We need to get that desire and attitude back. They were so close last year but we need to be challenging for trophies on all fronts and that takes a toll on the squad so we need to look at the squad. “We need people who want to be here and contribute so the signings will be key. But if we stick together and go along the path that I want then we will definitely be successful, it doesn’t always come quickly. Things take time and people are always impatient.” Chiefs’ only hope of silverware this season is the Caf Champions League where they have reached the quarter-finals for the first time.
