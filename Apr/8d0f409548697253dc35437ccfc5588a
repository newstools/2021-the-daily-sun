IN 2004, American singer Usher released a smash-hit featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris titled Lovers and Friends. The song speaks about the conflicting roles played by lovers and friends in a relationship. It speaks about how the lines can be blurred, and this has been a constant debate. Can a heterosexual man and woman be just friends? Well, according to the Scientific American publication, a heterosexual man and woman cannot just be friends. New research suggests that the idea of romance is often lurking just around the corner of friendship, waiting to pounce at the most inopportune moment. In the United States of America, a study was conducted on 88 pairs of undergraduates to determine the validity of the “Just friends” concept. The results suggest large gender differences in how men and women experience opposite-sex friendships. Men were much more attracted to their female friends than the other way around. Men were also more likely to think that their opposite-sex friends were attracted to them. Women, too, were blind to the mind-set of their opposite-sex friends. This is because generally, women were not attracted to their male friends - they assumed this lack of attraction was mutual. As a result, men consistently overestimated the level of attraction felt by their female friends while women consistently underestimated the level of attraction felt by their male friends.
