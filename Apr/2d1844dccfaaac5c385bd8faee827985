INFLUENCER Jackie Mcobothi has spoken out on her alleged abuse. In a lengthy Instagram post, which was accompanied by several photos showing bruises on her face, Jackie fingered her ex-boyfriend as her alleged abuser. In the same post, she also said she’s tired of shielding and protecting someone who had allegedly abused her. Detailing her story, Jackie said: “I’ve been silent for too long and this has been haunting me throughout my life. I’d represent a positive front within my relationship but reality is that I was covering up for the man I called my love, a partner and a friend. “He abused me physically, emotionally, financially and my well-being. He’d abuse me and lay hands on me even after providing for him financially. His behaviour would sometimes be of a monster. He would turn into a person I never knew and of course apologise the next day and yes, I’d forgive him after everything he has done.” Jackie said the abuse affected her to a point where she had to lock herself in her room and cry herself to sleep. “Mentally I know I need help and I’m willing to get help because I know I’m not okay. The difficulties of hiding the scars from my family and friends by wearing clothes that cover the scars and sunglasses, even when the weather is gloomy outside, is just the most difficult part. And to lie and say I fell hit home.” She told Daily Sun she’s relieved after sharing her story and that it gave courage to the exes of her alleged abuser to come forward. Jackie said women should not allow incidents of abuse to happen more than once to them. She said she’s in the process of opening a case. Daily Sun couldn’t reach the alleged abuser.
