HE managed
to get into the car, but once inside he started seeing flames. The dumb
tsotsi couldn’t drive the Renault Duster after threatening the driver out with
a rifle. In the
video, which has gone viral on social media, a black car can be seen stopping
in front of the Duster. A man
carrying a rifle comes out and runs towards the SUV, forcing the driver out. His
accomplice then drives off. As the tsotsi tries to drive the SUV, he’s seen
struggling. Moments
later, armed cops can be seen ordering the tsotsi out of the car and then
arresting him.
