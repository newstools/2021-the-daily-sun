CHIPPA United caretaker coach, Siyabulela Gwambi, will be desperate to make a good impression in his first match in charge. Gwambi has been entrusted with steering the Gqeberha-based outfit into calmer waters after their recent struggles. And he could not have asked for a tougher baptism against defending DStv Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns at Sisa Dukashe Stadium this afternoon (3pm). He took over the reins from axed former coach Dan “Dance” Malesela. The young coach, however, is not intimidated by Downs. Instead, he sees it as a great opportunity. “Everyone is looking forward to the Sundowns game,” said Gwambi. “Sometimes when you play against the log leaders and you happen to be at the bottom, you see yourself beating them. “In doing so, you realise that the points you will get are the same that will get you out of relegation. “It excites and motivates the players, even more, when you play the calibre of opponents that we will be playing against. “We understand we have a huge responsibility on our shoulders but the boys are ready.” Sundowns might be coming from a defeat in the Champions League against Algerian outfit CR Belouizdad but their domestic form has been almost flawless. They head into their Premiership clash with the Chilli Boys looking for a strong response, according to co-coach Rhulani Mokwena. “We face Chippa on the back of a defeat and haven’t felt like this in a long time,” said Mokwena. “The mood is sombre. There’s a feeling of unhappiness. But it’s okay. This is how we will test our mental fortitude. “We have to arrest the situation, feel the pain as it drives us to not want to be in this space again.”
