NEWS coming from Egypt is that Pitso Mosimane has been offered a contract to coach their national team. Mosimane is currently the Al Ahly coach and should he accept the offer then he will coach both Africa's two massively successful football clubs. According to a report from the SoccerScenes Africa & Globe: "Egyptian Football Association is offering Pitso Mosimane a contract to Coach both Al Ahly and Egyptian National team. If Al Ahly agree he will have two jobs in Egypt." Mosimane is currently in the forefront of landing a Bafana Bafana coach, following the sacking of Molefi Ntseki after his failed attempt to qualify for the 2022 Afcon. Now, with Mosimane at the peak of his coaching career and loved all over the continent, it remains to be seen whether Safa will win the Pitso battle or the Egyptian FA will romp victorious. Egypt’s coach Hossam El-Badry is under immense pressure, this is despite having qualified for the 2022 Afcon. But most Egyptians want him out and are not happy with his performance, even though he finished top of their group with 12 points. The team's pattern of play and style is not going down well with Pharaohs fans. El-Badry retaliated on Tuesday by telling Ahramonline that he is a subjected to "unacceptable criticism" from local media as he is facing “unprecedented difficulties” since taking over the team in September 2019. El-Badry broke his silence after the severe criticism he faced following the team's lacklustre display against Kenya 1-1 last Thursday in the fifth round of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. “Criticism is acceptable, but when you are criticised intensely for personal reasons by some people and some of media figures, that is unacceptable. They attack the players and talks about players' personal problems,” El-Badry told a local radio channel.
