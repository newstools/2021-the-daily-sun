THE
35-year-old man didn’t think his day would end in horror when he went for a
ride on his bike. His throat
was slit with a Chinese manja while he was riding on Sunday afternoon on
Southern Avenue in Kolkata, India. The man’s
family members went to three hospitals and he was refused admission due to an
acute shortage of beds as a result of Covid-19. According
to The Times of Indian, the severely injured man was shifted to the Apollo
Gleneagles Hospital at about 9pm where a three-hour surgery was conducted to
repair the wound. “His two
major blood vessels were damaged which took a lot of time to repair. There was
huge blood loss before the patient reached the hospital and presently, he is
recovering well in the hospital. We plan to discharge him in a couple of days,”
said Dr Abhik Ghosh.
