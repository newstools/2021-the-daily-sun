MAMELODI Sundowns barely have time to wallow in their Nedbank Cup misery! Up next on their hellish fixture list is the away DStv Premiership trip to AmaZulu on Wednesday, which will be followed by a home fixture against Kaizer Chiefs on Sunday. It won’t get any easier for the log leaders as they also have another tricky encounter against third-placed Golden Arrows and Orlando Pirates afterwards. Added to that is their Caf Champions League assignments, which could stretch even the largest of squads thin. Masandawana suffered only their third loss in all competitions this season, as they sunk to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the Nedbank semi-finals at the weekend, losing 6-5 on penalties following a goalless draw. But co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi reckons it would have been better if they lost in regulation time and avoided the rigours of extra time and the draining penalty shoot-out. Despite having a squad big enough to field up to two luxury buses, Mngqithi is wary of the toll the fixtures are taking on his team. “We don’t have a choice. We have to pick ourselves up. We have another tough one on Wednesday which requires a lot from us. It’s important that we come back quicker and not slumber because of the result today,” said Mngqithi. “In hindsight, you can say it would be better to lose in 90 minutes than to go all the way to the penalties when we’ve got such a tough match on Wednesday. “But we are a big team and we’ve got the personnel. We were unfortunate that some of our key players had to pull out at the 11th hour against TTM, Denis Onyango and Mosa (Lebusa). But truth be told, we never struggled in that regard. We could not score because TTM made our life very difficult.” But Mngqithi once remarked, Downs have a “responsibility not to lose a lot of matches”. He added: “We are always focusing on making sure we win every match. “We even feel bad when we get a draw or lose a match.”
