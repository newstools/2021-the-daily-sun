SOCIALITE Norma Mngoma is on the road to getting her life back together after a tough couple of months. Norma took to Instagram to talk about her new business Zefara, which she said is her way of starting afresh. She posted a video of people sewing and said her new business produces school uniforms, corporate uniforms and masks. Norma, estranged wife of former Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba, was in fashion school last year but dropped out because of emotional distress. She said she’d always wanted to own a clothing manufacturing company and finally did it. “When life took a turn and knocked me down in the past few months, I discovered myself in my lowest moments,” she said. “I took time to pause and dig deeper into what I wanted in life and where I wanted to go. “I always had a dream to own a clothing manufacturing company, hence I decided to go back to school in 2019 to study fashion design so that I could fully understand the fashion industry. “Life happened last year and I had to drop out of school. I struggled to focus on my school work because I was so emotionally drained, but I never stopped dreaming. “In October I started working on plan B and put my plan A on hold because it needed a clear mind. “By God’s grace it worked out. Today I’m here to introduce my dream: I’m the director of Zefara.” Norma also took to Instagram last week and spoke about what happened when she got arrested last year. She was charged for malicious damage to property and crimen injuria. She said she didn’t know that Malusi was the reason for her arrest and he did not tell her until her bail hearing. She also said she heard about their divorce from a newspaper. However, all charges against her were dropped last month and she’s ready to start afresh and move on.  A post shared by Norma.Mngoma ????
