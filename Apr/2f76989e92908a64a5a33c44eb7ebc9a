LEGENDARY singer Yvonne Chaka Chaka is fuming. This after she found out there is someone who claims that she is dead and is collecting money from people through a GoFundMe account. Yvonne took to social media to warn everyone not to fall for this scam. “Some fool posted my obituary and even asked people to contribute in a GoFundMe account for my burial. How mean can you be,” she wrote. "So to the Devil I am alive and kicking I am going nowhere.thank you all for the love and support. Don’t fund Evil he asked for some go fund." Although in the past the Umqombothi hitmaker has said she’s not afraid of death, she is livid that people could make such claims without any confirmation.
