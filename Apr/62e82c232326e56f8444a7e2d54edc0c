THE SA Football Association have agreed on a deal with Carlos Queiroz to take over as the new Bafana Bafana coach. The Portuguese will be announced tomorrow as soon as the Safa National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting is completed. Without confirming Queiroz as the successful candidate, Safa, however, have confirmed they have concluded talks with the new coach. Queiroz is strongly believed to be the man Safa members have agreed on. In his second stint with Bafana, Queiroz will succeed Molefi Ntseki, who was axed last month.
