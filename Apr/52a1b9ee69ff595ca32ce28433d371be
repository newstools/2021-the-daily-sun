A BURNT body was found in the garden at Bongolethu Primary School in Philippi Browns Farm, Cape Town, on Tuesday. Parents have vowed their children won’t eat vegetables from the garden. They blamed the Department of Education. SGB member Pumeza Qamata said they’d previously asked the department to erect a fence. She said the incident could’ve been avoided if that had been done. “I don’t know how many times we asked the department for a proper fence,” said Qamata. “The school is unsafe. Criminals have access to do their dirty work. “We hope this incident will make the department act fast.” Bambalwa Rhayile said her kid won’t eat vegetables from that garden.

Caretaker Mziwethu Mkhethwa said this was the first time something like this had happened. “The only thing that usually happens is break-ins,” said Mziwethu. “The department needs to act fast before we find bodies in the classrooms.” Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer said: “The body was found in an area at the back of the classrooms. “This is truly saddening and must have been extremely traumatic for anybody who saw it.” She said the district office dispatched a team to offer psychosocial support to pupils. “Pupils were dismissed from school early while police attended to the scene.” As part of the Western Cape safety plan, we install perimeter fencing at 30 schools each year.” She said Bongolethu was included on this priority list for completion in 2023/24. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a murder case had been opened after a burnt body of an unidentified man was found. “Police detectives are following up leads in order to arrest the suspects,” said Rwexana.
