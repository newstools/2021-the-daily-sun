AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy was elated to put pressure back on DStv Premiership leaders Mamelodi Sundowns and Golden Arrows after his side beat TS Galaxy 2-1 at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Saturday. McCarthy was happy to see his side bounce back after drawing 0-0 against Sundowns in their previous match. Following this win, Usuthu moved to 44 points from 24 matches. AmaZulu have now achieved their highest ever points tally in the PSL (44), surpassing that of 2008-09 (42) when they finished eighth. Knowing he faces two big challenges away against two on form sides, Cape Town City on Wednesday and neighbours Golden Arrows this Saturday, the former City coach has highlighted how key this win over Galaxy was to keep the pressure on at the top. “It was a perfect way to bounce back and these three points have put some pressure on Mamelodi Sundowns and Golden Arrows. If we collect points at home it will count in our favour,” said McCarthy. “We want to put the mentality right because we got two difficult games coming up.” Lehlohonolo Majoro was the toast of Usuthu on Saturday scoring both goals to take his league tally to seven, one ahead of Luvuyo Memela. AmaZulu have lost only two league matches at home, winning seven and drawing four of 13 matches. They are left with two home games against Baroka FC and Swallows FC. McCarthy wants to see his side make it difficult for opponents in Durban and was delighted with his team’s attitude. “We started the game really well, we didn’t wait to see what the opposition will bring,” said McCarthy who has lost only once at home since he arrived in December. “I know when we are at home we try and be clinical and be direct. We try to pick a fight with everybody.” Against City on Wednesday, McCarthy will be boosted with Thapelo Xoki back from suspension. However, he will be without Mbongeni Gumede who is suspended.
