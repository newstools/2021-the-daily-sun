HE wanted to get rich quick. The man went to the zama zamas to get gold, but he didn’t have enough cash. The sly zama zamas gave him gold but told him he had to leave his Ford Ranger as a security. He took the gold to the dealer to sell, but it turned out to be fong kong. When he went to demand his car back, he discovered that the zama zamas had disappeared with it. And to make matters worse, the Ford Ranger didn’t belong to him but his brother. The frustrated man went to the Springs Police Station to open the false hijacking case. Captain Johannes Ramphora said the car was circulated and it was found in possession of the zama zamas. “When interrogated, they told the cops that they didn’t hijack the car but it has been given to them as security and they kept until the owner returned with the money owed to them,” said Ramphora. Cops are now looking for the man. The initial statement the man made to the cops was that he was hijacked at gunpoint while waiting for the robot to open for him. He said the street vendors who pretended to be selling phone chargers approached and pointed him with the gun. He jumped out of the car and fled, and they drove off with the Ford Ranger. Captain Ramphora said cops are looking for him. The suspect is facing perjury charges if convicted. “We warn people to stop opening false cases as this is a serious crime. And the state can’t be wasting it’s resources for false cases.”
