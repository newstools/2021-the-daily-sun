AT 15, Lufuno Mavhungu was tragically bullied to death. After a video of the grade 10 pupil from Thohoyandou being beaten by other pupils went viral, we can only imagine that something snapped and broke in that teenager. When you’re a teenager your emotions are fragile. What may seem to be a problem that some can survive easily may be quite difficult to cope for many young women and men. With the advent of the cell-phone and kids snapping open their gadgets to capture every embarrassing and humiliating moment of young people’s lives, kids now grow up with more serious problems than yesteryear. Not all children have the mental strength to deal with the problem of being the laughing stock of the village or kasi. The suicide of many teenagers today is further impacted by bullying and their shaming on social media. Bullying at our schools is a huge problem, but we hardly see any awareness campaigns by relevant authorities to tackle this issue. There are zero programmes in townships to even bother to stop this problem. As a result, videos of kids bullying each other at schools while others whip out their cellphones to record the beatings happen way too often for comfort. It is tragic that today a young girl has been reduced to a social media hashtag and her family is drowning in tears. The stock answer by the Department of Education lacks accountability and real care for young people. When are they going to stop ticking boxes and come up with real solutions? – Editor.
