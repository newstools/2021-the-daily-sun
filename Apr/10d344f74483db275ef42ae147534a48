He has paid ilobolo for his long-time girlfriend, Sinesipho Mbandazayo. “Going on one knee to ask for Sinesipho’s hand in marriage was one of the most nerve-wracking things I have ever done,” the Idols SA season 11 winner told Daily Sun. “But having our families there to witness the moment kept me calm. It was more meaningful than doing it in a  in front of strangers.” He said they met in 2016 and started dating in 2017. “From the very moment we started dating, I knew she was the one for me.

The singer said the lobola negotiation was a beautiful ceremony. “The family was very welcoming. We had to adhere to how they do things because we come from different culture. It was a beautiful union of two cultures,” he said. Karabo said they don’t have the date for the white wedding yet. “I don’t know if anyone is ever-ready for anything in life because everything is a risk. But you know when the risk is worth taking. I have made the most beautiful decision. She is excited. I am glad I could put a smile on her face,” he said. Sinesipho told Daily Sun she was emotional and happy at the same time because her family was welcoming toward Karabo’s family. “It was exactly as I had imagined it. Throughout our talks I never wanted him to propose in public,” she said. “We have been friends for a long time. As a couple, we fight and get along like siblings. “I believe this next chapter of our life will be amazing.”
