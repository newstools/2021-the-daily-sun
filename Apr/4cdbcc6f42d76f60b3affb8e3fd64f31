REVENGE is the last thing on Banyana Banyana’s mind as they host Botswana Zebras in an international friendly match at Bidvest Stadium on Tuesday afternoon (3pm). In the last meeting between these two sides, The Zebras booked their Olympics ticket at the expense of Banyana in September 2019 after a penalty shootout victory at the Orlando Stadium in the qualifiers. Banyana coach Desiree Ellis said they would be looking to improve from that performance, instead of seeking revenge. She said: “It’s never about revenge because you will be going there for the wrong reasons, and you are not setting up for what it is that you want to do. We are going there to play a game, improve on this performance and hope to give others a chance.” "Botswana have been in camp for the last two weeks as they are also preparing for their 2022 Africa Women's Cup of Nations qualifying match that is expected to be played in June. Ellis added: "It will be huge one but once more, we must challenge players to raise their game and make sure that they have not forgotten what happened in the past. Banyana will be missing in this year’s Olympics for their first time since 2012. On Saturday, Banyana thumped Zambia 3-1 in a friendly match at the same venue. Spanish-based Noko Matlou scored a brace while Kgatlana scored the third goal for Banyana in that match. Banyana goalkeeper Kaylin Swart also admitted they suffered heartbreak against Botswana the last time, but they are looking forward to the game. Swart stated: “We are looking forward to the clash (vs. Botswana) – it is another big task for us as we know what Botswana can produce. Yes, it is a friendly match, and I would not say it is a rival game, but we had some heartbreak in the past against them, and we want to do the best we can. “We have to have the same mindset we had on Saturday when we face them and have a good battle because it is not going to be easy, but I think we are up for it.”
