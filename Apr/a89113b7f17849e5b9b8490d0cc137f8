FOOTBALL and menstruation are two things not often mentioned in the same sentence. In fact, the topic on women’s health is still taboo . However, Banyana Banyana star Thembi Kgatlana is determined to change with her campaign “Buy a girl a pack of sanitary towels”. With 144 Women teams in the Sasol League and 14 teams in the Safa National League, Kgatlana’s initiative has never been more relevant than it is now. The campaign will run for a month, starting on 3 May, across Mzansi. Kgatlana has explained that her foundation, the Thembi Kgatlana Foundation, will donate the sanitary towels to schools and to women teams across the country. “We are looking to raise R350 000 in this drive,” said Kgatlana. “People can donate from as little as R50. We are not asking for much. I have committed R20 000 from my pocket towards the campaign.” Kgatlana said more details will be announced next week regarding donation destinations. The 24-year old plays for Spanish Primera Division side SD Eibar. She joined them from SL Benfica in July last year and has performed admirably this season with 10 goals from 20 appearances. She has since been joined at Eibar by Banyana teammate and stalwart Noko Matlou. Today at 15h00 I'll be live with @SimplyCarol8 on my IG @Kgatlanathe1st talking about an upcoming campaign for my foundation and the work we do in South Africa. See you then!
