THE transition in government financial years is delaying March and April payments of the Covid-19 social relief grant. Sassa CEO Totsie Memela said the end of March was the end of the financial year for government and various administrative tasks were required before any payments related to the previous financial year could be made. “All private and public institutions whose processes constitute dependencies have been roped in and are working tirelessly with Sassa to stabilise the situation. “Sassa would like to apologise for this break in the payments and would like to reassure all deserving applicants who have been affected that payments will be made as soon as the administrative processes have been completed.” Memela said they were busy with these end of financial year tasks which have delayed payments. “Sassa received confirmation of the extension of the relief grant on 11 February after all its administration systems had in fact been closed at the end of January, the previously announced closing date for this grant. “Systems were reactivated immediately on receiving confirmation of the funding for the extension and the application channel was once again operational as from 13 February. “A total of 86 363 new applications were received for February alone. Every single one of the more than 10 million applications for this grant are validated on a monthly basis to ensure payments are made to applicants who qualify for the grant. Payments for February were thus made at the end of February and early March.” Memela said applications for March were validated as usual after the payments for February had been completed, but were not extracted for payment before 31 March.
