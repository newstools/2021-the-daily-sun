MORUTI “Baby Face” Mthalane has expressed big respect for British boxer Sunny Edwards whom he will share the ring with on 30 April in London. “I have a lot of respect for him, having gone 15 fights without a loss. He is very good and I am bracing myself for a big fight,” said Mthalane. Edwards will be challenging Mthalane for his international Boxing Federation (IBF) world flyweight title-holder, which the 39-year-old has held for five years. Mthalane, who last fought in 2019, said he is feeling great and ready for any eventuality. “Much as he is still young, but in boxing, I don’t prepare for advantages and disadvantages. I just need to 100% ready and take advantage of any opportunity that I might have.” He said that he is not going to London to hand over his title to a 22-year-old, “but I will fight hard to come back home with it”. “Training has been great. I trained hard last year for the December fight, but it was cancelled. I spent the whole of lockdown training. I’m focussed for my fight. Fans can brace themselves for a good fight and I will not disappoint them all,” added Mthalane. He last fought on 23 December 2019, when he knocked out Akira Yaegashi at the Arena in Yokohama while successfully defending his world flyweight belt at the time. After the long-awaited homecoming Jayson Mama title fight was cancelled by the Boxing South Africa Commission in December last year, Mthalane remains undefeated since his 2008 loss to Nonito Donaire.
