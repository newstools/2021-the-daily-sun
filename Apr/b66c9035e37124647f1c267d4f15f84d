PLANS to bring back home the remains of slain South African rugby player Lindani Myeni are underway. The government of KZN led by Premier Sihle Zikalala is working with the family to repatriate his remains from Hawaii, US. The 29-year-old man originally from Empangeni, northern KZN, was gunned down a week ago allegedly by police in the City of Honolulu. On Wednesday, 21 April, a delegation from the premier’s office led by Director-General Dr Nonhlanhla Mkhize, visited Myeni’s family home. Zikalala said the aim of the visit was to establish the family’s domestic circumstances and details regarding the funeral arrangements. “As the government of KZN, we remain hopeful that justice will prevail and that the killers of Myeni will be brought to book soon,” he said. He said Mkhize will work with the Myeni family to provide the necessary assistance and support at this time. Zikalala also said: “We are in regular contact with the Department of International Relations and Co-operation and the Office of the Consul-General to consolidate efforts towards the repatriation of Myeni’s remains back to his country.” He said on behalf of the government and people of KZN they continue to express their sincere condolences to the Myeni family. Zikalala also applauded the citizens of South Africa for pledging support in various ways to the family.
