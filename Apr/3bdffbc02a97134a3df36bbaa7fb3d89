ABSA has parted ways with its first black CEO Daniel Mminele following an agreement. Mminele has stepped down and will leave the group with effect from 30 April. “The board was very excited about Daniel’s appointment and the positive role he was going to play at Absa. It is a matter of considerable regret that we reached this position. The parting of ways merely reflects divergent professional views and approaches,” said Absa group chairman Wendy Lucas-Bull. She said this was on a “no fault” basis. “The board has conveyed to Mminele its continued high regard for his competence and integrity. The parties believe this course is in the best interests of the company and Mminele. This was a very difficult decision that was not reached lightly,” said Lucas-Bull. Mminele said: “It is, however, important for the chief executive to be in complete alignment with the board on critical issues such as strategy and culture.”
