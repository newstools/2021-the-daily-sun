MPUMALANGA police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma has strongly condemned violent behaviour displayed during an unlawful protest at Masoyi, which started on Monday, 29 March. A bakery truck and a bus were torched, while windows of another bus were damaged by unruly people. The fuming residents were allegedly demanding water. Zuma has since assembled a task team of investigators to probe the lawlessness to bring those responsible to account. “In the early hours of yesterday, police were notified of a protest action that was carried out by some members of the community at Masoyi. The Public Order Policing members were sent to deal with the situation. While in the area, police received information about protesters who barricaded the road at Nkanini in Masoyi, where the bakery truck was reportedly stopped by these individuals who then instructed its driver to alight from the truck. It is said they looted about 12 000 loaves of bread from the truck before burning it,” said Zuma.  Later in the day, Zuma said a bus driver also came under attack at Mahushu, where protestors had barricaded the road with different objects and ordered him to get off the bus then torched it. He said another bus was also not spared as its windows were smashed. However, the drivers were not harmed during these incidents. “When people decide to protest due to challenges they are faced with in their communities, whether as a result of poor service delivery or any other matter, they should know that their actions must be conducted within the ambit of the law. The community must also not allow a situation where some unscrupulous individuals with ulterior criminal motives hijack their course, take advantage of community challenges and use such opportunity to steal and destroy property. Our country is governed by formidable laws and people cannot do as they wish,” said Zuma. Police continue to monitor the situation.
