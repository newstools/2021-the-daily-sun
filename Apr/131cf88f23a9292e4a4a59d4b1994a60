A SUSPECT (37) was arrested after he was found transporting dagga worth R600 000 on Wednesday, 21 April. This comes after an intelligence-driven operation was conducted on Paulpietersburg Road in Vryheid, northern KZN, after cops received information about two cars that were transporting dagga. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a 37-year-old suspect was found driving one of the cars, while the driver of the second car managed to escape. “The cars were spotted travelling on the Paulpietersburg Road and they were intercepted. The driver of the bakkie, aged 37, was placed under arrest after he was found in possession of eight bales of dagga,” said Gwala. Gwala said the driver of the other car abandoned it and fled into a timber plantation. “Upon checking his car, the police found 329 parcels of dagga. The total street value of the recovered dagga is R600 000. The arrested suspect will appear before the Vryheid Magistrates Court for possession of drugs,” said Gwala. A resident (45) said “The sad part is that these suspects sell the dagga to young children, which is wrong. They are making money out of children who don’t know the difference between right and wrong. It’s a good thing that police caught them before they delivered the dagga,” he said.
