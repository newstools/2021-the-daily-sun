WHILE he was doing his schoolwork on 4 December, someone suddenly grabbed him and pointed a knife at him. The thug then took his phone and disappeared with it. The incident happened at a free Wi-Fi hotspot at Thandi Sibeko Secondary School in Duduza. The schoolboy reported the incident and cops started searching for the suspect. After following leads, the suspect was bust. On Friday 16 April, Nigel Magistrates Court sentenced Ben Mndaweni (21) 10 years for robbing the pupil of his cellphone. The accused was found guilty of aggravated robbery. Sergeant Harry Manaka said the pupil was with other children using the Wi-Fi service when Mndaweni pulled out a knife, held him against the wall and took his cellphone. Sergeants Harry Manaka and Busisiwe Mntambo traced and bust Mndaweni later that evening. Detective Sergeant Welile Bless investigated the matter by presenting evidence until Mndaweni was sentenced. “Robberies with weapons are a major concern in Duduza. They occur even in broad daylight and the community cannot afford to live in fear of being attacked and deprived of their belongings by these thugs. That is why a strong warning had to be sent to all those who would want to emulate Mndaweni,” said station commander Lieutenant Colonel Bheki Mhlungu. Mndaweni will spend 10 years in prison and seek to be rehabilitated.
