QUICK police response to crime is a vital part of crime fighting – but more than 2 000 police vehicles are out of service in Gauteng! DA Gauteng shadow MEC for community safety, Michael Shackleton, said on Monday, 12 April that this information was revealed by Police Minister Bheki Cele in his reply in the National Assembly. Shackleton said this was an increase of more than 700 vehicles since November. He said they were calling on Cele and Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko to ensure that the 2 170 police vehicles that are out of service are immediately repaired. Police stations said to be hardest hit include Vereeniging cop shop with 100 unavailable police vehicles, Benoni Police Station at 82, Springs cop shop at 65 and Protea Glen Police Station at 58. It’s understood that there are 5 967 operational police vehicles in the province. Shackleton said Cele stated that his department has sent workers from other garages to the problem garages to address the high number of out of service vehicles. Mathews Mogotlane of Rabasotho section in Tembisa said residents often waited too long for police to respond to calls. “We are told the police van dispatched is in another area attending to another crime. By the time police come to the crime scene, suspects have fled,” he said. Another resident, Matome Manaka said: “We desperately need efficient police protection.” At the moment there are 32 police vehicles out of service in Tembisa and 36 in Tembisa South.
