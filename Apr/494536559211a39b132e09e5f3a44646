MANY issues important to gospel artists were discussed at the Gospel Artists Indaba at The Favours Cathedral Church in Tshwane yesterday. Advocate Moafrika Wa Maila, founder of Pastors Against Church Closure and co-ordinator for Gospel Artist for Change, said the movement started in February because of the way gospel artists were treated. “We want gospel music to be given a high priority,” he said. He said on 13 and 14 May, they would be march to the SABC in Auckland Park, Joburg, to demand that their music gets played according to the Broadcast Act of 1999. Singer Lufuno Buda Mudau said many artists had been affected since the lockdown. “Our music is not played regularly, which leaves us without an income. We want gospel music to be treated like any other genre of music,” he said. Gospel singer and co-ordinator of the movement Justice Sunduza said his movement catered for artists who were ill-treated, exploited and abused. He said some were afraid to raise their voices, so this served as a platform for them. “We want to unite gospel musicians to work together and help each other,” he said. Prophet Vincent Pitseng of Burning Fire International Ministries said some artists didn’t get the Covid-19 relief funds. “As pastors and artists, we need our music to be played,” he said.
