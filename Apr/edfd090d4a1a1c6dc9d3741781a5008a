President Cyril Ramaphosa is back at the Zondo Commission today. Yesterday Ramaphosa acknowledged that some ANC leaders and members were corrupt. He said the extent to which corruption contributed to practices of patronage, factionalism and the manipulation of organisational processes within the ANC is a matter of record. He said the organisation could have done more to prevent the abuse of power and misappropriation of resources that defined the era of state capture. He says he still doesn't know the majority of the donors until today, he adds that he would have never allowed that. #StateCaptureInquiry  He says even after spending so much money on the campaign, but they are still in debts. #StateCaptureInquiry  The President tells the commission that he was far away from the Financers which financed the CR 17 Campaign. #StateCaptureInquiry  Now the #StateCaptureInquiry #StateCaptureCommission is getting some back-bone with #pretorius biting back with #athindsight can't be acceptable to just say 'it happened & won't happen again so let's move on.'
