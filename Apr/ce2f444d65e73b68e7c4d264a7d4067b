HEALTH Minister Zweli Mkhize has announced his department has secured an additional 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which means 30 million doses will be delivered. The minister was briefing the Portfolio Committee on Health in Parliament yesterday. He guaranteed that the number of people to be vaccinated had increased from 10 to 15 million. He said the first batch of over 300 000 vials was expected on 3 May, while the rest would be delivered weekly. Mkhize said the Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson agreements, which both cost US$10 per vaccine, had non-refundable clauses. WATCH: MAGWINYA DOUGH, FEET SHOCK! “The agreements state that down payments that have been made in advance by the department shall not be refundable by the manufacturer to us in any circumstances. “This is another onerous term that we had to settle for,” he said. Mkhize also announced retired Chief Justice Sandile Ngcobo had been appointed to head the scheme, which had to be established as a precondition by Johnson & Johnson. He said he agreed to help with chairing no-fault compensation (NFC). “His experience makes him an ideal candidate to oversee all claims and processes are followed by the NFC fund to uphold fairness, transparency and equity, and protect the constitutional rights of our citizens.”
