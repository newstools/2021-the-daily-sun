THE insight provided by Rulani Mokwena into Orlando Pirates proved key for Mamelodi Sundowns in their Nedbank Cup victory, co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi has acknowledged.  The Brazilians routed the Soweto giants 4-1 at Loftus Stadium on Thursday as they marched on majestically to the Nedbank semi-finals.  Even though the coaching trio works as a unit, Mngqithi singled out his co-coach Mokwena for praise, mainly for the insight he provided on the Bucs team he guided a year ago.  “I think the game panned out the way we anticipated, a lot of good work from coach Rulani in giving us better insight on individual players and their challenges. It showed immensely on the performance,” said Mngqithi.  “Because we knew a little bit more and areas where we can punish them, and credit must be given to him for that. Coach Steve (Komphela) worked very hard to demand the press, which is what we demanded a lot from this game and the players responded. “We should have scored more goals than what we scored, I think if I’m not mistaken I saw maybe three or four possible penalties that we should have had, on transition we created some good moments in the first half. “But overall, I think the boys are coming okay, they're working hard defensively, they are suffocating opponents with their counter-press.”
