Last night was the big premiere of the much-anticipated series Diep City, which stars Mduduzi Mabaso and Dawn Thandeka King, among others. After just one episode Mzansi has already fallen in love with the show, which tells the tale and struggles of four young women trying to make their way in the world. It focuses on disillusioned young women forced into crime while in high school just to make ends meet. Producer Mandla N told Daily Sun people are going to be blown away.
