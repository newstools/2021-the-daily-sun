ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule refused to answer whether he’d step aside after 30 days, as directed by the National Executive Committee. But he vowed to remain a member of the party. During a visit to Soweto where he planted trees yesterday, Magashule said he did not intend forming or joining any other political party. “I will live and die in the ANC. I have been in the struggle and did not join it yesterday. I have remained a loyal member of the ANC,” he said. “I have served the ANC with dignity, respect and discipline. My blood will remain green and gold. I will die in the ANC. “I am not one of those people who say my blood is green and gold and form another party. I will never form another party.” Magashule was given 30 days to consult with former ANC leaders, but President Cyril Ramaphosa emphasised that the decision was not reviewable. He revealed the first leader he would consult with is former treasurer Mathews Phosa, who indicated he would be available on 11 April. His office would also finalise the date and time with former president Jacob Zuma. Magashule said he’d also consult with former deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe and former president Thabo Mbeki. “Let’s wait and see after 30 days. The organisation has decided. “It has taken its decision, in line with the Nasrec resolutions. I support the Nasrec resolution.” Asked whether he would go to court if he is suspended, he said: “You don’t resolve ANC matters through the court of law, you resolve them through politics.” Magashule joked with the media that he was not losing sleep over the decision and was not stressed at all. “Look at me, am I stressed? Can’t you see, I am fit. No headache, disease, whatever. I am fine and am part of the NEC collective,” he said.
