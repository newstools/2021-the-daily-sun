AMAZULU are breathing down the neck of Mamelodi Sundowns in what is shaping into an exciting league title challenge. As Mamelodi Sundowns were held to a goalless draw by Golden Arrows at Loftus Stadium, Usuthu trounced Cape Town City 5-1 in Cape Town last night. Before last weekend’s round of DStv Premiership matches, the Brazilians were flying high and sitting pretty at the top of the table, while Usuthu their nearest rivals were supposedly in crisis mode following an indifferent run of results.  The Brazilians are beginning to realise that parked buses generally do not travel very far as they held by a stubborn Arrows side at home.  Uncertainly is starting to creep into their game, as they start to look clueless in attack. It is not the fact that they could not win, but more about them not creating as many chances.  But the star-studded Downs side should have enough in their arsenal to field a strong any given day. Arrows are still third on 43 points, though Mandla Ncikazi’s men could have upset Sundowns.
