OUPA Mabaso, played by seasoned actor Lehasa Moloi, is back with a bang following the return of Mzansi Magic drama series Rockville. Fans will remember Oupa from five years ago when he was a skhothane who loved girls and a nice time. The kasi boy even fell in love with a girl from a suburb, and turned to deejaying and radio presenting. Lehasa said the energetic Oupa has grown and is now ready to settle down. “He’s no longer doing one-night stands. He’s more mature and ambitious. “I’m not intending to reinvent the character at all. However, the audience will be moved emotionally,” said Lehasa.

My time now will be between film-making and music.” Lehasa, a gym fanatic, plans to take gym into people’s homes through social media. “I’ll soon be helping people to have the right mindset in as far as wellness is concerned. There will exercises, nutrition and weekly coaching. If you know something, share it.” He said he’ll be appearing in a romantic comedy. The Vow will be on Netflix in September. “I’m playing the husband of singer and actress, KB Motsilanyane,” said the star from Welkom, Free State. Lehasa said he’s excited to be back on social media and in the public eye. “I’m ready after a three-year break from the spotlight. “I pulled back in order to have access to my soul and check myself. I want to put Mzansi on the global map.” Lehasa has played television roles such as Zakes Moloi on Gold Diggers and Lebo on Broken Vows.
