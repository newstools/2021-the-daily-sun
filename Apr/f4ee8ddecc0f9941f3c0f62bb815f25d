LATE legendary jazz artist Sipho Gumede will be celebrated on his birthday, 17 April, at The Bat Centre in Durban. Event organiser Nise Malinga said: “His last performance was on 16 April 2004 at The Bat Centre, and he was born in 1952. “For this reason we believe this is not just a coincidence. There’s a special meaning behind it,” said Nise. “We’ve always wanted to honour this legend. He paved the way for many black jazz artists. “There can’t be a better time than now. We wish he was alive to witness this event. But his spirit will be with us.” The event will reflect on the journey Gumede and fellow jazz artists travelled. “The event is about keeping his legacy alive,” said Nise.

We connected on every level. Honouring him in this way is like a dream come true for me, I am truly humbled.”
