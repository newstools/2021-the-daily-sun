FOR more than five years the pastor has allegedly raped young girls – and he’s been released on bail. Parents in Cosmo City, northwest of Joburg, said the pastor raped the girls aged between eight and 15 in his church and at his house. They alleged he’d give them money and threaten to kill their families should they say anything. In February one of the girls told her parents and other girls also came forward. Furious parents opened a case and he was arrested. He appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court on Monday, 19 April. “We were told to wait outside,” said a parent. BANTITI STOLE MY HEART! “It was only the suspect, his wife, his lawyer and the magistrate in the court.” The parents thought they were going to be called in but when they saw him coming out with a big smile on his face, they suspected he’d been given bail. The parents contacted the investigating officer, who was as surprised as they were. “We fear for our children because we don’t know what he’s planning next,” said a parent. “Our children walk to school and he has a car. What if he kidnaps them to destroy the case?” One parent, who’s related to the suspect, said her children used to visit the suspect.
