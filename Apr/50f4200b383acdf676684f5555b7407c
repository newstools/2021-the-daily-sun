FORMER radio presenter, Kwazi “Captain” Magubane was stabbed and killed in a car hijacking on Monday, 5 April. Kwazi’s death was announced by his former employer, the community radio station, Imbokodo FM on their Facebook page. The 36-year-old leaves behind a five-month-old kid and his fiancée, Thabile Zulu. Thabile, who was too distraught to talk, confirmed Kwazi’s death before she passed the phone to his best friend, Nkosi Gumede. Nkosi told Daily Sun Kwazi was travelling with his two friends from KwaMashu to Sydenham. “From what we understand, they were followed by an unknown vehicle from KwaMashu. When they got to Sydenham, his friends got out of the vehicle to relieve themselves. “He was in the car talking on the phone. The suspects attacked him and demanded the keys. But the keys were unfortunately not with him,” he said.
