Zamalek racked up a 4-1 win over Teungueth FC at the Cairo International Stadium on Saturday evening, but it was not enough to secure progression from Group D of the CAF Champions League. The White Knights were ultimately denied a spot in the quarterfinals by Mouloudi Club d’Alger, who managed to sneak a draw away to group winners Esperance de Tunis in a simultaneous match in Rades. The standings ended with Esperance top on 11 points, MCA second on nine points, with Zamalek (eight points) and Teungueth (four) suffering elimination. Zamalek started the game strongly and claimed the lead in the 16th minute, with Mahmoud Hamdi Elwensh getting on the end of a set-up from Mahmoud Shikabala to send an effort beyond goalkeeper Baye Cisse and put the hosts in charge. On 25 minutes the White Knights doubled their advantage, as Ahmed Fettoh picked out Marwan Hamdi and the attacker provided a neat finish, putting clear daylight between the Egyptian heavyweights and their visitors. Things got even better for Zamalek late in the first half, as a further goal each from Elwensh and Hamdi in the 41st and 38th minute respectively saw them enjoy an impressive 4-0 lead at the interval. Teungueth had been battered in the first 45 minutes, but they punched back to score a goal early in the second half when Papa Sakho took advantage of some slack defending from the hosts and steered a shot past goalkeeper Mahmoud Genesh. Zamalek eased off in the second half, knowing that they had done all they could to try and secure qualification: their fate rested in the hands of the result in Rades and when news came through that MCA had secured a draw, the White Knights dream of a sixth Champions League title was at an end.
