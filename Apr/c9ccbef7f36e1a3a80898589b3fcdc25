SINCE childhood, Thabo Jama’s dream was to help those living on the streets. And the 32-year-old from Krugersdorp, on the West Rand, is now making his dream come true through his organisation called Black Triple Eight. He has helped many young people from ekasi with computer skills and donated food to the needy. Thabo told Daily Sun: “My organisation aims to help people and offer them the necessary skills. “I didn’t have everything I wanted while growing up. I vowed to help anyone who walked the same path I did.” Thabo said he has been giving back to the community from his own pocket for over five years. He cooks for 100 homeless people and supplies another 100 struggling households with food parcels every month. He also provides computer and business classes to unemployed youth. “I started a skills-based empowerment programme to help better the lives of young people when I realised that they were destroying their lives through drugs and alcohol. “I help 30 young people with computer lessons and business management skills on Tuesdays and Fridays. Most of my students are unemployed and are from child-headed homes,” he said. Thabo said he held events to raise funds to continue helping others. He has also published two motivational books to give hope to people. Violet Manele (27), who is part of Thabo’s computer programme, said: “I had no idea about computers. I now know how computers work and am confident to apply for jobs such as office administration.” Another student, Mpho Hanong (27), said the course has helped him shape his life. “The course will certainly open doors for me,” he said.
