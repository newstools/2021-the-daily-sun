THERE’S no doubt Benni McCarthy has had a huge impact since joining AmaZulu. The former Cape Town City coach has turned the KwaZulu Natal side into a formidable side since taking over the reins. They have gone from top-eight hopefuls to league title contenders in a short period. And the club have not been shy to show their appreciation and admiration for their head coach. They gifted him a new car not too long ago and they have now followed that up with an unusual visit to his home. The club paid a surprise visit to McCarthy’s mother’s house this week while they are in the Mother City for a clash with their coach’s former team the Citizens. They gifted McCarthy’s mother, Dora, with an Usuthu jersey and cap before asking for blessing heading into the clash with City. Watch the video below: A post shared by AmaZulu FC (@amazulu_fc)
