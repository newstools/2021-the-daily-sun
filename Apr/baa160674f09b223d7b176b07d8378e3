TWO brothers are behind bars for allegedly committing a business robbery. Joburg Central SAPS spokesman captain Xoli Mbele said the two suspects, aged 24 and 26, were bust on Tuesday, 6 April at a Pep store on Albertina Sisulu Road. Mbele said it is alleged the suspects entered the shop pretending to be customers. “One of them pulled out a firearm and his accomplice jumped over the counter and took an undisclosed amount of money from the till,” he said. Mbele said they also allegedly took several cellphones worth R40 000 before they fled the scene. “Victims screamed for help and people and security came to their rescue.” He said a chase ensued and the suspects dropped the bag and some of the community members helped themselves. “The suspects fired one shot and police, who were busy with their crime prevention duties, apprehended both of them,” said Mbele. He said the firearm was recovered, together with live rounds of ammunition and some of the stolen items. “An investigation is underway and the suspects will appear soon in the Joburg Magistrates Court,” said Mbele.
