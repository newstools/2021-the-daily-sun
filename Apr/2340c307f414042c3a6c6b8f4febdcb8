A Mpumalanga farmer and his son have been arrested for allegedly killing two job seekers and injuring another after a scuffle broke out on a farm when a group of men went to seek seasonal work. The father and son are part of a group of four suspects, aged between 25 and 53, who are due to appear before the Piet Retief Magistrateâ€™s Court on Monday, 12 April 2021. They are facing two counts of murder and an additional charge of assault with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm relating to the alleged assault of another man. This incident happened on a farm in Dirkieskop on Friday. Mpumalanga police spokesperson Colonel Donald Mdhluli said the court appearance stems from an incident in which a group of men are said to have gone to the farm owner to seek employment as seasonal workers. Allegedly the farm owner informed the men that they were not welcome on his premises. According to Mdhluli, the job seekers then decided to leave the farm, but later realised that one of them had been left behind. He said they then went back only to find that he was being kept on the farm by the suspects. Scuffle
