 IT could be a private car, or itâ€™s also possible that it is
a dealer car. Whatever the case may be, the individual who was driving the
sports sedan may have got a little bit manic behind the wheel. Much of the damage sustained to the car is around the front. The hood has been badly dented and scratched, part of the
bumper has been torn off, the kidney grille has been smashed, and the
passenger-side headlight has also been destroyed. A post shared by BIMMA WORLD (@bimma_world)  According to Carscoops, severe dents and scratches continue
down the passenger side of the brand new BMW and extend through to the rear
quarter panels. The rear passenger wheel is also covered in grass and dirt
and the tire has been ripped from the rim, indicating that the car went on an unplanned
off-road adventure.
