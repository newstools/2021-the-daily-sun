TENDAI “Beast” Mtawarira has become the latest SA athlete to join American sports management agency headed by Jay Z, Roc Nation. The Rugby World Cup-winning Springbok prop joins Springbok captain Siya Kolisi and his former Bok teammate Cheslin Kolbe as well as Proteas fast bowler Lungi Ngidi‚ who joined in November last year. “I am thrilled and truly honoured to be involved with Roc Nation Sports. The brand is dynamic and forward thinking and that’s exactly what I need in this next chapter of my life,” said Mtawarira in a statement released by the agency. Mtawarira is the most capped front-row player in South African international rugby, having played 117 times for the Boks. He made his debut in 2008 before winning the famous 2009 B&I Lions series. Mtawarira finished his 11-year international career in style by lifting the Webb Ellis Cup as a Rugby World Cup winner in 2019 after a dominant performance in the final. He also hold the record for the most Super Rugby caps for the Sharks (159), who earlier this year also entered a strategic partnership with Roc Nation Sports. The 35-year-old has been keen to find the next stage in his career after retiring from all forms of rugby after the Covid-19 pandemic cut short a stint with Old Glory DC in America’s MLR.
