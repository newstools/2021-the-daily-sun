THE 14-year-old pupil who was caught on video allegedly assaulting Lufuno Mavhunga, who later committed suicide, was released on R1500 bail. The Mbilwi Secondary School pupil who’s facing a charge of assault appeared in the Thohoyandou Children’s Court on Thursday 29 April. Limpopo NPA spokeswoman Mashudu Malabi-Dzangi said a bail of R1500 has been granted bail with a condition that the accused will not interfere with witnesses and not travel outside Limpopo without the knowledge of the investigative officer. “We opposed the bail, looking at the seriousness of the offence even though we are dealing with a child who conflicts with the law,” Malabi-Dzangi said. On Wednesday 28 April, as the investigative officer testified during the bail hearing, it emerged the accused girl might not be safe if she’s released back to her community. The teenage girl was arrested over three weeks ago after being seen in a viral video repeatedly slapping Lufuno. Lufuno was later found unconscious inside a room at her home by her mother after she overdosed on tablets. She was rushed to Siloam Hospital where she was certified dead.
