SHE was tired of being abused by her boyfriend and ended the relationship. But the man didn’t take it well and allegedly tried to strangle her. The 33-year-old woman from Kagiso, west of Joburg, told Daily Sun her ex-boyfriend (40) had always told her she wasn’t going anywhere. “He always told me I’m his and no one else’s. I sometimes thought he was joking, but it sounded serious and intense when he was mad at me,” she said. She said they got into an argument on Sunday, 28 March that was when she decided she was done for good. “I was at his place and don’t remember what we argued about,” she said. “I didn’t think the argument would get me a beating. “He got aggressive and grabbed my arm to stop me from leaving.” The woman said her boyfriend then allegedly assaulted her. “He pushed me onto the bed and choked me,” she said. “I begged him to let me go. I told him I was joking about breaking up, and that’s when he let go of me.” The woman said she later laid a complaint of assault at Kagiso cop shop. Captain Solomon Sibiya said cases of assault and domestic violence were opened. “The suspect was arrested and will appear in court soon,” Sibiya told the People’s Paper.
