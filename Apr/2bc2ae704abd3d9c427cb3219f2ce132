KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt feels his side deserved to win their DStv Premiership encounter against Baroka FC on Thursday. Amakhosi were denied a top-eight spot when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Baroka FC at Peter Mokaba Stadium. Lebohang Manyama had put Amakhosi in the lead, but Evidence Makgopa's late strike canceled his goal to earn them a point. Talking after the match, Hunt said he was disappointed with the results as he believed they could have earned maximum points. "We deserved to win the game. I thought we were a better team. You know if you get that penalty in the first half it helps you know. But we have not been getting (penalties), two, three games in a row," Hunt said. "We haven't been getting those situations, even when it's blatant. It's disappointing, because it gives you a little bit of momentum. We should have killed it off. But over the 90 minutes I thought we were the better side, but it doesn't always work like that," Hunt said after the match. The point leaves Amakhosi in position nine in the log standings with 25 points after 21 matches, while Bakgaga moved to position 11 with 24 points in 22 outings. Chiefs' next match is on Wednesday, where they will host tricky Cape Town City at FNB Stadium (3pm).
