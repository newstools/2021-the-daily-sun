WHEN life gives you lemons, make lemonade. That is what University of Cape Town students made out of
the fire incident that saw them being evacuated from their residence as a
precautionary measure. Students, who are now housed at some of the city’s top
hotels, have been living it up and exhibiting a life of luxury. On Twitter, @gxsiame wrote: “I’m so happy for UCT students
from rural areas that get to experience hotel living.” The students have been sharing pictures of themselves inside
their hotel rooms. And the fire, which fortunately didn’t claim any life, has
been a blessing in disguise for some of them. I see #UCT students are flexing in 5 star hotels pic.twitter.com/qhg7EPvvmq  A Tanzanian man has since been arrested and charged with
arson for his alleged involvement in the fire, which damaged hectares of land
and a history library at UCT. Other social media users said the students were enjoying
their temporary hotel stay way too much. Uct res students are sleeping in hotels tonight ?? pic.twitter.com/QR6cUJpHxA  User @nkosi wrote: “UCT students are going through the most.
You’d swear it was said the fire won’t be put out and they’d stay at the hotels
forever. Abasagowi!” Then @Minora247 added: “God forbid some UCT students enjoy
their hotel stay a little too much and start looking for their inner
arsonists.” Another social media user @Preezlie said: “There’s trust
issues and then there’s UCT students worrying because they might see hotel stay
bills on their fee statements.” Then @_DJCappuccino said: “Evacuated UCT students are housed
in hotels and private homes while at the University of Limpopo we went straight
to Uniting Dutch Reformed Church.”
