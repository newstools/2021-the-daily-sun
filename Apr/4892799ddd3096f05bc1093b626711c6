Orlando Pirates depart on Wednesday on a lengthy and expensive journey to Libya where they will become the first club side to play in the strife-torn north African country since a ban was lifted on international football there. Libya have not been allowed to host any home games for the last seven years while a bloody civil war has raged in the country but last month the ban was lifted. Pirates play Al Ahli Benghazi in their Caf Confederation Cup group match on Sunday as they become the first club to visit the stadium in Benina on the outskirts of Libya’s second city.Last week Libya’s national team hosted Tunisia at the same venue in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.Pirates will travel via Paris, Tunis and Tripoli before reaching their destination and only arrive back in Johannesburg next Wednesday.Tickets for the trip cost roughly R30 000 per passenger, representing an almost R1-million investment in a single game for the club.Pirates have been assured of their safety in Libya where an action-starved capacity crowd is expected to watch the game. -SuperSport
