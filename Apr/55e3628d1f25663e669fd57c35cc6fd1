Illicit liquor valued at R10 million was seized by police during a raid on a Douglas house in the Northern Cape on Friday 9 April. The imported alcohol came through the borders of South Africa illegally, explained police spokesperson Colonel Mashay Gamieldien. A 50-year-old man was arrested and charged with possession of illicit alcohol. He was further charged for attempting to bribe a police official after he allegedly offered the police R170 000 to turn a blind eye. After the cash was counted, it was seized as evidence, said Gamieldien. She said the suspect will soon appear in the Douglas Magistrateâ€™s Court. Gamieldien said the bust followed a weeklong surveillance operation in Southnay Street in Douglas by a collective team comprising of Provincial Organised Crime, Kimberley SAPS Designated police officials, Security Intelligence, and the South African Liquor Board.  According to Gamieldien, the raid was executed at the residence of a male on 09 April 2021 at 09:30.
