BAROKA FC have momentarily subjected Kaizer Chiefs to 10th position on the log when they beat Chippa United 1-0 in their DStv Premiership clash at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday afternoon. The Chilli Boys’ winless run extends to 10 games, which could see their somewhat historic season end in tears of sorrow, if they continue dropping important points like this. The club made history at the weekend when they beat GladAfrica Championship side Pretoria Callies 1-0 in the Nedbank Cup semi-final to reach their first-ever domestic final. They will meet Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the final at the Free State Stadium on 8 May.But that could count for nothing as they are in danger of losing their bread and butter, DStv Premiership status. Goodman Mosele scored yesterday’s solitary goal, just four minutes before the half-time break when Chippa goalkeeper Rashid Watenga made a mistake, unable to clear a back pass. The result now means Bakgaga Ba-Mphahlele completed a double over the Chilli Boys this season, as they defeated them 2-1 in the first round. Baroka also ended a five-match winless run, in their quest to complete the season within the top eight for the first time ever since they were promoted in the 2016-17 season. Siyabulela Gwambi’s Chippa remain deep in the relegation zone, along with Black Leopards, who are rooted at the foot of the table. After 23 matches, Chippa remain in position 15 on the log with 17 points, gathered from three wins and eight draws. They are four points ahead of Leopards, who have 13 points out of 22 matches. Chiefs, who face Cape Town City on Wednesday afternoon, were casualties as they dropped from ninth to 10th position, with 25 points from 21 games.
