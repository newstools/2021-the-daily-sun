ARTISTS have taken their frustration to the doors of the National Arts Council (NAC). The struggling artists, together with the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) picketed outside the NAC’s offices in Newtown, Joburg, because the much-awaited R300 million relief fund has failed to make its way into their pockets. “The NAC management, including its board, have been lying to the industry. They went to the media and said they had spent R75 million and that by 31 March the council would have dispersed 75% of the total amount but that has not happened,” said artist Thami Mbongo. “They are lying to the public and don’t deserve to be in these offices.” Saftu’s spokesman Trevor Shaku said: “There is mismanagement of resources, irregularities in the management of the state enterprises and institutions managed by the state.” He said the council had to make sure it served the artists equally and fairly. RASTA PAINTS NOXOLO GROOTBOOM! “It seems the arts council has committed irregularities in the dispersing of the funds while we are in the midst of Covid-19, which has hit the sector hard,” he said. Author, Brian Ntombela, said to his knowledge, the council has not paid anyone. “The NAC and Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa are trying to exploit the artists. “Some have been forced to sign contracts to only receive 30% of what is due to them,” he said. Mthethwa recently tweeted: “As the minister ultimately responsible, I firstly want to issue an unconditional apology for the task I entrusted with the NAC. “You can rest assured that the much-needed stimulus for the sector will continue to be disbursed and we’ll hold those who over-committed funds accountable.”
