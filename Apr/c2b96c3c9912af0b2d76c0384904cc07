OPERATION O Kae Molao was in full force on Thursday, 22 April. This as Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela led the operation in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. He said there had been an increase in crime in the area, especially housebreaking, motor vehicle theft and robberies. “Among other things, there’s a high level of drug abuse in Hammanskraal. We felt we had to come and enforce the law to strengthen the arm of the station commander and district commissioner,” said Mawela. He said detectives started the operation on Wednesday by raiding houses of wanted suspects, and that more than 900 were arrested. Mawela said one suspect was arrested at a roadblock for being in possession of a firearm without a licence. “There was a vehicle that was discontinued because it was not roadworthy. We also arrested four undocumented foreigners. Home Affairs will check whether their documents are in order and if not, they will be repatriated to their countries of origin.” Mawela said the operations were also being carried out in Joburg, Ekurhuleni, Sedibeng and the West Rand. Furthermore, he said police had received a number of complaints about spikes being on the roads. “This is an old trick used by criminals. But now it’s starting to show its ugly head again, mostly in Tshwane on the N4. They target people where there are no lights,” he said. Mawela said police arrested one suspect for placing spikes on the road, but others managed to escape. He urged residents of Mamelodi, where there had been problems with a local gang, to report all criminal activities. “I’m calling on those who have been approached by people calling themselves Boko Haram to go to the police or call the investigating officer,” he said. Mawela said that two people were arrested for taking over hostels in Mamelodi.
