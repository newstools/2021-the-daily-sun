A Bethelsdorp man has been found guilty of a 2019
"murder spree" in which three people were killed. "The Eastern Cape High Court in Gqeberha sentenced 24-year-old Neavan Demingo to three life sentences for executing a
murder spree during April and May 2019," said regional NPA spokesperson
Anelisa Ngcakani. The court also imposed sentences of five years for
attempted murder, six years for two counts of unlawful possession of ammunition
and 15 years for each of two counts of the unlawful possession of a firearm. The court heard that on 30 April 2019, Demingo and an
unknown accomplice approached Moegamet Zane Abrahams and another unknown man
while they were standing in a Bethelsdorp street. A shooting ensued. When Abrahams fled, the two turned their weapons on
bystanders, Austin Carlo Tembula and Fernando Oswald Ashia, before they fled. Breadwinners A month later, on 18 May 2019, Demingo and two other
suspects approached Jacques Richard Roberts while walking in a street in
Bethelsdorp. "Demingo and one of the two men then drew their
firearms and shot at Roberts. Roberts fled, but Demingo and his accomplice
continued to shoot at him. He died later in hospital as a result of the gunshot
wounds. The motive for these murders is unknown," said Ngcakani. Demingo was arrested on 20 May 2019 at the Bethelsdorp
police station. Acting Judge Ivana Bands acknowledged that Demingo had
been raised in an environment where he was subjected to ongoing gang-related
violence daily. "I pause to mention that the personal
circumstances, whilst regrettable, are not unique, with a vast proportion of
our citizens sharing a similar background, yet not resorting to the conduct of
the accused, which led to the senseless death of three young men," Bands
said. She added that it was clear from the evidence tendered
by advocate Rafick Ahmed that Tembula, Ashia and Roberts were responsible young
men who were breadwinners. SOURCE: NEWS24
