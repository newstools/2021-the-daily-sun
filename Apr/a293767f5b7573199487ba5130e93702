POLICE have launched a manhunt for a gang of unknown suspects who’ve been robbing petrol stations in Mpumalanga. Armed suspects stormed the Engen garage in Hazyview, bombed the ATM, and fled with an undisclosed amount of cash on Wednesday, 7 April. Colonel Donald Mdhluli said two armed men stormed the petrol station, held staff hostage and demanded cash. “The suspects then robbed them of packets of cigarettes as well as an undisclosed amount of cash from the tills. “The suspects ordered staff to lie down and blew up the ATM inside the garage store. “They helped themselves to an undisclosed amount of cash before they fled the scene with the stolen items.” In another incident, armed thugs bombed an ATM at Vahlave Shopping Centre in Rolle Village. “We believe it might be the same group of suspects who’re terrorising businesses and targeting petrol stations and ATMs,” said Mdhluli. “A case of business robbery was opened for investigation and no arrests have yet been made, but a manhunt has been launched and we want to urge anyone with information on the whereabouts of the suspects to contact Captain Eurence Sibuyi on 082 449 0231.
