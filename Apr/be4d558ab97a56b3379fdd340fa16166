Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology Blade Nzimande appealed to students and staff at tertiary institutions to remain vigilant after pockets of Covid-19 infections were reported within the sector. According to a statement by the Department of Higher Education on Saturday, Nzimande attended a briefing with regard to the current outbreaks at various universities and TVET colleges. Nzimande said the reports of new cases at tertiary institutions was extremely worrying. "While Covid-19 has largely been detrimental for the older population groups, the virus is mutating and new variants are showing a higher affinity towards young people, who can serve as carriers and fasten the spread of infection. Unfortunately, that would fire up the third wave," Nzimande said. When Nzimande received the report, the worst-affected institution was the University of Pretoria, where 55 students had tested positive as of 31 March. On Saturday, the university confirmed the number has increased to 115 students to have tested positive since 18 March.
