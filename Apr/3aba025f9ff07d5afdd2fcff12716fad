AFTER a year of lockdown, a musical about the life of King Shaka’s mother Queen Nandi was finally staged. She’s regarded as having opened women’s eyes to cultural oppression. Queen Nandi’s brave life was celebrated through Queen Nandi The Musical during a commemoration of International Women’s Month and Human Rights Month. The play was staged at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban on Sunday. Musical director Edmund Mhlongo told SunBuzz Queen Nandi was a smart, brave woman – one of the most influential Africans. Mhlongo said: “Women can take many things from her difficult life. Queen Nandi was rejected by her family and the family of her baby daddy after her pregnancy before marriage, but she wasn’t discouraged. “She raised her son, Shaka Zulu, to become a respected Zulu king.” ALSO READ | BARACK OBAMA MOURNS HIS GOGO’S DEATH The musical, launched in 2018, toured KZN to teach women about the queen’s inspiring life. Last year the play’s cast were set to perform in New Orleans, New York and in Chicago in the USA. The tour was cancelled due to lockdown. Mhlongo said they were happy to have finally staged the play. “I hope if everything goes well and that Covid-19 cases go down,” said Mhlongo. “We’ll do our US tour again to showcase our rich history overseas.” Mhlongo also plans to stage the play in Eshowe, northern KZN, where Queen Nandi grew up and is buried.
