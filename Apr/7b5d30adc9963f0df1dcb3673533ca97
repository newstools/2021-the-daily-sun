 AN intense law enforcement operation has seen a City Power
official behind bars. The official was arrested on Monday at Rabie Ridge, Midrand for
stealing and connecting electricity illegally to the residents at a nearby
informal settlement. Following the arrest, the government department has since welcomed
the apprehension by City Power Revenue Protection Services, SAPS, JMPD, and
Group forensics. In a statement, City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said illegal
connections are part of the reason the area is experiencing regular outages due
to overload and infrastructure vandalism. “Security and police remained in the area to monitor the place
after the cut-offs of illegal connections. The community tried to reconnect
themselves around 21h00 after the cut-offs, and they clashed with the police
and the deployed security. A shootout also ensued and one community member was
arrested,” he said. City Power loses millions due to illegal connections. The utility
has been working with the police and prosecution authorities on strategies to
ensure arrests with evidence and effected and prosecuted. Head of Security at City Power Sergeant Thela said "City
Power is embarking on a step-change approach to fight illegal connections which
often result in overloading and outages. The approach is underpinned by crime
information-driven operations and prosecutorial process to arrest and lock up
perpetrators of these crimes. This entails various steps which cannot be
disclosed owing to their sensitivity. Our successes will not only be measured
on arrests made but will include several cases successful prosecuted".
