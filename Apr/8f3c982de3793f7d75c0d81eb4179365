IT’S all systems go for the Road Safety Easter Campaign, which kick-started on the N3 Heidelberg Weighbridge yesterday. Led by the Department of Transport, law enforcement agencies were out in numbers stopping and searching vehicles. The latest technology which was provided to traffic officers to work in a real-life situation was also put to the test. This included body cameras, drones and high-speed vehicles. Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) CEO Makhosini Msibi urged road users to be careful on the roads and leaving for their destinations early. WATCH: MAPONAPONA MEETING! Msibi said no car would be left unchecked during the operations. “It’s our target to ensure all vehicles are checked. Ordinarily, we would only check public vehicles the most, but in this operation, we are doing all of them to ensure nothing is left unchecked,” he said. “Most people who drive exotic cars don’t renew their motor vehicle discs. So, we will be looking out for that as well.” RTMC spokesman Simon Zwane said: “We expect higher traffic volumes this year although the long weekend doesn’t coincide with the closing of schools. “We know which corridors will be busy and will deploy traffic officers to ensure visibility at all known hazardous roads from Gauteng to all coastal areas and Limpopo. “Those travelling to Mpumalanga should expect delays on the N4. There is road construction from Middleburg to Machadodorp, so people should leave early,” he said.  Msibi said they would also monitor the N2 highway, which connects the Northern Cape, Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KZN. Bafana Magagula, chief strategic manager, said they were prepared and have improved other things because of Covid-19 regulations. “We are already out. Some are on the N1, N3 and at taxi ranks. “We continue to encourage drivers and taxi owners to rest when they are tired. “There is money next year, there will be money in the near future and there will still be money in the many years to come,” he said.
