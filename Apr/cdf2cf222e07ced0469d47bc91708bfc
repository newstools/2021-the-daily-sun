GEORGE Lebese certainly hasn't lost his style. The former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns star midfielder hasn’t neglected his sponsorship duties with Puma. Lebese mutually terminated his contract with US side Switchbacks as he could not travel overseas due to strict Covid-19 regulations in America. But life hasn’t been treating bad, as he reveals with a series of images captured from the comfort of his crib.  “Puma asked me what does great mean in today’s world. To me it means being a great human being and not just a great athlete,” said Lebese as he offered some motivation. “Before 2020 I was focused on getting faster, stronger and becoming a better player. And that’s all still important to me, but the sport has become an escape for me. My focus as a person is now to be more emphatic, to understand what the communities I belong to are going through, and also what the communities I don’t belong to go through. Changing your perspective isn’t easy but it’s something I try to work on every day like I try to improve my game every day.”
