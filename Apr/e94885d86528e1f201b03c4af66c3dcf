FORMER Mpumalanga Legislature member David Dube has promised to fight rampant corruption in the ANC. He’s one of five candidates contesting for the chairman position left vacant by David Mabuza when he was elected deputy president in December 2017. Dube told Daily Sun people had lost hope in the ANC. He said his campaign had a mini manifesto after he consulted with people on the ground. “It speaks to the needs of the people. Our motto says it can never be for the people without the people. We’ll continuously listen to them,” he said. Dube said even though it would be difficult to fight political gate-keeping in Mpumalanga, he’d do it once elected. “We’ll try to eradicate gate-keeping and factionalism. That’s the most dangerous area that created factions and disunity,” he said. WATCH: MAPONAPONA MEETING! The ANC’s Mpumalanga conference will be held in May. Other candidates are acting chairman Mandla Ndlovu, Nkangala District Municipality speaker Lucky Ndinisa, Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane and Deputy Tourism Minister Fish Mahlalela. Dube holds a PhD in public administration from the University of Fort Hare. He faces four counts of money laundering and one of contravening the Public Administration Management Act. He’s charged with 14 others, including NEC member Bongani Bongo.
