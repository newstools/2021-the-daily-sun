Bullying at schools continues to destroy the future of pupils. A number of kids fall victim to bullying and no one seems to care. Whatever way it happens, itâ€™s an unacceptable behaviour. The education policy in Mzansi emphasises the importance of creating safe schools that encourage respect for human rights. Despite these policies, bullying continues to happen. The recent suicide by Lufuno Mavhungu as a result of bullying is shameful. Parents, teachers and school governing bodies need to stand up to fight bullying at schools. Tougher legislation is needed in South Africa when it comes to bullying. - Letter by Rachel Molema, Theresa Mews
