Eldorado Park gangster Farouk Meyer was laid to rest at Avalon Cemetery this afternoon. The funeral was attended by a large number of residents. Farouk was shot dead on Monday evening while closing his shop. He was in a car with another person in the suburb when gunmen opened fire with a high-caliber assault rifle. Even though it's a sad day for the family, some residents were happy that he's finally rested. A family member who asked not to be named told Daily Sun that the family is sad and they only hope that police will do their job. A resident said as much as he was a gangster, he cared for his community and took part in giving out food hampers to the poor. "No one is perfect, he did what he did and that's between him and his maker. But he was a gentleman to the needy" said the resident. Tashrique Meyer also shared her sadness. "Today we lay you to rest, we lay down not only a father, an uncle, a brother and a friend. But today we lay down a Phenomenal man, a soldier amongst armies, a Beast amongst men, and one of the most amazing, caring, and loving persons I know," she said. "Let them talk, let them smile, let them celebrate but Allah knows best And you are now straight in Jannah, I'll keep making Dua that Allah grants you the highest in Jannah Firenze. The pain is unbearable, you are gone but not forgotten and you will always be in our hearts R.I.P Uncle Farouk I love you dearly and your legacy will continue and your story will never end," added Tashrique "We're all devastated and just want to know who would do such a despicable thing. I hope we find justice," he said. He also said they pray a lot and know that God will avenge them.
