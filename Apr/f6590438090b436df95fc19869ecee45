A group of supporters loyal to ANC secretary-general Ace
Magashule gathered at Luthuli House on Thursday, publicly pledging allegiance
to the beleaguered party leader. The hive
of activity outside the ANC's headquarters come as Magashule is in Nkandla consulting
with former president Jacob Zuma with two weeks left on an ultimatum that he
step aside or face suspension. This
after the party's national executive committee (NEC) gave a deadline of the end
of the month for party leaders who were criminally charged to step aside from
their positions. Magashule is out on R200 000 bail and is facing
corruption-related charges. The
group, which held placards, was calling for other leaders to step aside as
well, including President Cyril Ramaphosa and other members of the NEC. "Almost
everyone in the ANC is implicated or alleged to have done one or two things
which are criminal offences," Thabo Baleni from the ANC Belemond
branch in the Free State told eNCA. He said
if all party leaders were made to step aside, the ANC would collapse. "We
are here to save the ANC." On
Wednesday, the party's national working committee affirmed that provincial
leaders had until the close of business on Thursday to make a list and inform
those affected by the decision. Magashule
is the most senior party leader affected by the so-called step-aside
resolution. Baleni
insisted they were not a factional group masquerading as ANC supporters, saying
they were calling for the unity within the party. "We
are saying to the NEC come with a very sober mind. Save the ANC more than
anything else. Allegations will forever be there. The opposition will try this
and that and the media. What I'm saying is that today I will be able to go to
the police station and implicate any other member. The allegation, therefore,
calls for one to be stepping aside," he added.
