Dear MizzB I’M a 22-year-old woman and I have a cousin who is 25 years old. Lately we have been spending time together and discovered we are attracted to each other romantically and sexually. Is it wrong to date him since he’s just my cousin and not my brother? Dear Sista Family is anyone who is blood-related, whether cousin, uncle, aunt, brother or sister. Most African cultures don’t encourage or support dating someone who is your blood. You need to consult one of your elder relatives and get their perspective on this matter. No one can decide who you can or can’t date but yourself. Keep in mind that your life is your responsibility, and so are the choices you make. All the best!
