But as has often been the case this season, Swallows just didn't give up and pulled level once more with 76 minutes on the clock as Mere thumped the ball past Arubi from close range.The hosts had a chance to win the match in extra-time when S'fiso Hlanti hacked down Joseph Malongoane inside the penalty area, but Vries denied Meshack Maphangule from the spot as penalties duly followed.Arubi saved Mere's attempt before Maphangule made amends from the spot to put pressure on Nyatama. The midfielder struck his shot well, but Arubi did his best to emerge as the hero on the night. TTM now joins Cape Town All Stars who eliminated Cape Town Spurs 5-3 on penalties (3-3 after extra-time) in another thrilling Nedbank Cup last 16 match at Parow Park.
