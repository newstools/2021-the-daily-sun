FOLLOWING a series of brutal murders that happened last year, cops have finally arrested a suspect. A 23-year-old man was bust on Sunday in Tshelimnyama, south of Durban, with a cellphone belonging to one of the men killed in KwaNdengezi. He appeared in the Pinetown Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 2 February. Nine people were killed in one day in KwaNdengezi in September last year. Four men, aged between 17 and 21, were gunned down after being accused of stealing livestock. They were apparently pumped full of lead in full view of residents. Angry community members at the time claimed their victims had stolen their livestock. Later that day six people in a Renault Duster were shot at. One survived. They were stopped by a VW Polo occupied by men with covered faces. The men demanded guns from them before shooting them in their heads. Three men and two women died while one woman survived. Brigadier Jay Naicker said the suspect has been charged with murder, attempted murder and possession of stolen property. “He was remanded in custody until 12 February,” said Naicker. He said detectives expected to make more arrests as the investigation was ongoing.
