NEW Black Leopards coach Lehlohonolo Seema has promised a totally improved Lidoda Duvha side when they face Baroka FC in the DStv Premiership Limpopo derby at Peter Mokaba Stadium on 20 February. Lidoda Duvha have struggled in their league campaign, but the former Bloemfontein Celtic and Chippa United mentor told SunSport that his side will turn around their fortunes and move away from the bottom on the log. So far, Leopards have managed to collect nine points – the same as Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and Maritzburg United, who are above them on goal difference. Seema, who took over the helm from the fired Dylan Kerr a fortnight ago, has welcomed the two week break he had with his lads to prepare for their next league match. “Our 2-1 win against Jomo Cosmos in the Nedbank Cup last-32 last week was what we needed to bring back the boys’ confidence,” said the former Orlando Pirates captain. “We have had enough time to prepare for our next game as we worked on positions we have to improve on. But one thing I can say is that victory against Cosmos was a huge confidence boost to us.” In their league run, Leopards have suffered four straight defeats, losing to Cape Town City, Chippa United, Mamelodi Sundowns and TS Galaxy. In those four matches, Leopards conceded 10 goals. The last time Leopards won a league encounter was in their 2-0 victory against Orlando Pirates at Thohoyandou Stadium on 17 January. But Seema is positive that things will change in their coming games as they cannot afford to drop points if they are to move from the basement of the table while it is still early in the season. Seema is set to welcome back his defender Edwin Gyimah, who missed their clash against Downs and Galaxy due to suspension.
