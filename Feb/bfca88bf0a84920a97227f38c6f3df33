THE Premier Soccer League will hold an executive committee (Exco) meeting this week to discuss the new kick-off times, according to a SunSport source. The Exco meeting is made up of eight people which include the PSL chairman Dr Irvin Khoza, acting CEO Mato Madlala and also involves the PSL stakeholders such as their sponsors plus SuperSport TV and the SABC. The meeting is expected to be held before the end of the week. This meeting is necessitated following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s readjustment of the curfew times under Level 3 lockdown restrictions last month. The new curfew is from 11pm to 5am. Previously, the country’s curfew, under the same Level 3, was from 9pm to 6am which was enforced towards the end of last year due to the second wave of Covid-19. That led to the PSL to change the times of the kick-off for games in the DStv Premiership, Nedbank Cup and also in the GladAfrica Championship to 3pm, 3.30pm and 5pm from its original schedule. However, this is going to readjusted again. The new time scheduling for kick-off times, according to our reliable source, will see matches played at 7pm instead of 5pm. “The time for kick-offs is going to be a little bit later,” said our insider. “Games will now be played later that the current 5pm kick-off time. “But we won’t have games starting at 8pm because that would not give people enough time to get home during the new curfew hours. “But the PSL is sure to opt for a 7pm kick-off time for the later games. “But it’ll all be confirmed this week.” However, it is not clear whether the PSL will schedule three games on some Saturdays as was the case when the original schedule was announced. The revised, rescheduled fixtures are expected to be released sometime next week.
