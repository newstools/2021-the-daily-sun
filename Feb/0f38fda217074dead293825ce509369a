THE first thing they teach you at driving school is to be a responsible driver and follow the rules of the road. Well… not many people do that after getting their driver’s licence, folks even skip red robots while driving. A video of a Nissan Patrol skipping a red robot has surfaced on social media. In the video, the Patrol can be seen speeding towards an intersection and then ignoring a red robot, soon after passing the robots he regretted the decision. The driver lost control of the SUV before it rolled.
