THE mayor of Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality Tshepo Justice Makolomakwa and his senior managers tested positive for Covid-19. This resulted in the institution being closed three times. On Friday, the municipality received a much-awaited porter camp from Development Bank of Southern Africa, where screening and testing of employees and visitors would take place. This, according to the mayor, who had since recovered from the virus, was a beautiful gift that would now reduce the number of people testing positive in his municipality. “We have been struggling without this structure. At least they will be in a safer area when it’s raining,” he said. The municipality also received 262 overalls, 138 blue gowns, 122 heavy duty gloves, 100 cloth masks and 100 face shields from South African Local Government Association (SALGA). SALGA’s North West provincial executive committee chairman Kgotso Khumalo said they chose Ngaka Modiri Molema as it was the most affected municipality in the province because of its rural nature.  “We saw the need after being told that some employees ended up sharing overalls. We wanted to make sure that they never shared again,” he said. Human Settlements MEC Mmoloki Cwaile, who was doing the handover, welcomed the gesture. “The building did not make provision for screening and isolation of employees in response to Covid-19.” He said it was appropriate that SALGA donated protective clothing. “Unions want allowance but we have established that it is also in a context of occupational health and safety that we have these kinds of provisions. We welcome this development,” he said. The new building was expected to ease up overcrowding at the offices.
