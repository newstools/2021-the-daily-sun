MAMELODI Sundowns will travel early to Algeria than they initially planned after their Caf Champions League match against CR Belouizdad was brought forward. Their group B match has been moved from 24 to 23 February but will still take place at the 5 Juillet Stadium, as initially planned. The change has been necessitated by the travelling challenges in Algeria due to the difficulty in getting flights between the North African country and South Africa, as a result of Covid-19. But unlike Kaizer Chiefs, the Brazilians will not play their Caf game at a neutral venue but will be allowed entry into Algiers. Sundowns are top of group B with three points, following their 2-0 win over Al Hilal of Sudan on Saturday. In the other match, Belouizdad played out a goalless draw with TP Mazembe in Lubumbashi.
