Lady Luck wasn’t on the suspects’ side on Tuesday, 9 February. Just when they thought they had succeeded in their evil deeds, cops stopped them in their tracks. According to police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters, a white Audi A4 was reported to be hijacked with a six-year-old in it in Rooihuiskraal, Tshwane. She said officers from the Rapid Response Unit and Joburg Flying Squad intercepted the suspects driving the white Audi. “Two suspects allegedly started shooting at the police and a shoot-out ensued. One suspect was shot and killed while the other suspect jumped out of the car and fled on foot.” Peters said members recovered an unlicensed firearm as well as the car that was reported to be hijacked in Rooihuiskraal. “A search for the suspect that escaped is continuing, while the six-year-old girl was rushed to hospital,” said Peters.
