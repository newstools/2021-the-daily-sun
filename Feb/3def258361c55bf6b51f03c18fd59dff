THE case against two suspects who allegedly killed a taxi boss in Barberton, Mpumalanga last Thursday has been postponed to 23 February for a formal bail application. The suspects, a 34-year-old queue marshal and 55-year-old chairman of the Umjindi Barberton Taxi Association and a correctional services official, appeared in the Barberton Magistrates Court on Thursday on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Last month, accused number one allegedly tasked accused two with killing Andrew Mwali (34) upon a date and time to be arranged. Mwali, who was vying for the position of chairman, was gunned down. According to police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, Mwali parked his Toyota Quantum at the house of a certain motor mechanic. When he alighted, an armed man emerged and allegedly fired a shot aimed at him, then fled the scene. Hlathi said police and paramedics were notified and upon arrival at the scene, Mwali was certified dead. Accused number one was arrested in his hideout place in Mbombela while accused number two was bust at his house in Barberton on Tuesday.
