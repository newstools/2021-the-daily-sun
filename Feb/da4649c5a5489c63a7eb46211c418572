He also said whenever he walks to the DJ booth, he engages with his audience. “I pick up the mood and digest it into the musical journey of my set,” said Thamzo, who encourages his audience to leave their problems outside the club. “I can even notice that person who’s not dancing but later stands up and dances to my playlist.” He started DJing when he was 14. “At 17 I was the finalist of Thetha FM’s Battle of the DJs,” he said. “I couldn’t compete at the finals because I didn’t have transport to take me to the finals. “I’m sure I would have won the competition.” Thamzo said his DJing career was inspired by his brother Luyanda Mzangwe and his mentor, Muzi kaNzimande. “They taught most of us in the kasi,” said Thamzo. “I can now balance the music I play according to the type of audience I have on the dance floor.”
