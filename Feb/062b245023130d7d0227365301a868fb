MISS SA Shudufhadzo Musida (24) is not bothered by the social media backlash she’s been getting recently. The Limpopo-born beauty queen, who’ll represent Mzansi on the Miss World stage, said she didn’t let the backlash define her. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “I don’t really respond to negativity. I’ve grown a thick skin. “I can’t respond every time people say things about me on social media. “ I have lots of projects under way, and that’s my focus.” She’s started working with mental health institutions. “I’ve been communicating with mental health institutions since last year,” she said.

At times they’re beneficial to my projects.” She doesn’t like to think about what she could have achieved if there was no Covid-19. “I’m Miss SA during an important period in our country, and it has been a learning curve.”
