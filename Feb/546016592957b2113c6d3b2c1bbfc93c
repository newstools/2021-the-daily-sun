OFFICIALS who enabled corruption at Prasa must pay back the money. This was the view of Zondo Commission Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, who believed taxpayers’ money could have been saved. He said Prasa should call all officials involved in the locomotives tender to explain themselves and sue those who gave unsatisfactory explanations. “The way this contract was handled looks like the interests of Prasa were subsidiary to something else’s. It is very worrying,” said Zondo. In 2013, the state-owned entity awarded a R2,65 billion contract to Swifambo Rail to procure locomotives for it. Zondo said something had to be done to get the money back as people were paid well to look after the interests of the entity, but failed to do so. “This is a lot of taxpayer money,” he said. Witness Ryan Sacks told the commission that Prasa executive Bridgette Gasa raised serious concerns about Swifambo in an email on 6 November 2012 to Prasa CEO Lucky Montana. He said despite these concerns, Montana allowed the negotiations to continue and the contract between Prasa and Swifambo was concluded thereafter. Sacks said Swifambo outsourced the work to German rail company Vossloh, which was paid R290 million with no legal relationship in place. He said according to analysis, a lot of confusing things happened in the contract as it appeared that Vossloh was paying rent for Swifambo offices before the Prasa contract. “At face value it sounds odd,” said Sacks. He said Prasa would have paid R120 million less on the contract price if the deal was done directly with the manufacturer. Evidence leader Advocate Vas Soni said it looked as if Prasa didn’t care. “To put it bluntly, it’s probably a fair summation by the counsel,” said Sacks.
