Rising star Nemzi has set tongues wagging with his new song SBWL, featuring Glits Arri. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said: “SBWL is a fun and energetic song that was inspired by social media posts by young men sharing their hurtful experiences. “It’s about a young man who is still working on his dreams. “He happens to fall in love with a lady who, at first, understood the situation but at a later stage got tired as she wanted the luxurious life. She always posts online that her man can’t afford her upkeep,” he said. The 24-year-old musician, whose real name is Menzi Mwale, said working on the song was an unforgettable experience. “I have worked with Glits Arri. It’s a collaboration that was long overdue. “When you finally do something you’ve always wanted to do, it always feels like a million dollar victory,” said Nemzi.

This will also be our way of testing and studying what people actually like so I can release something that’s relatable.” He said people should expect a fire project. “People should expect music that’s real and that addresses real-life issues. “That’s a path I’ve been preparing to venture into for many years in the music journey and I think with SBWL, we have started the process,” he said.
