A consignment of mandrax tablets, with an estimated value of R132 000, has been intercepted by the Hawks en route to Cape Town. Hawks
 spokesperson Zinzi Hani said, together with the K9 unit and Crime 
Intelligence and Provincial Organised Crime, they intercepted a bakkie 
near Victoria Heights in George. They had received information that the bakkie was transporting drugs to the Mother City from Port Elizabeth. "Upon
 searching the vehicle, the joint team, led by Hawks members, discovered
 drugs worth R132 000 hidden in a compartment behind the seat," said 
Hani. The driver of the vehicle, aged 46, was arrested and 
charged with dealing drugs, and is expected to appear in the George 
Magistrate's Court on Monday. News24
