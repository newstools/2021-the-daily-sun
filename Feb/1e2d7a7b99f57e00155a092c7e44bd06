TWO suspects were bust after being found with a stolen car in Leondale in Ekurhuleni on. They were bust by Ekurhuleni Metro cops’ specialised task team and SWAT/Intervention unit officers. Metro cops spokesman, Kobedi Mokheseng, said patrolling officers were stopped and approached by concerned residents. Mokheseng said the residents informed the officers about a suspicious house on Blesbok Street being visited by dodgy people. He said they told them about a dark- coloured German-make SUV with Mpumalanga number plates that was seen entering the yard at high speed. “Without any hesitation, members responded at 11.30am,” Mokheseng told Daily Sun. “Two occupants of a house, who’re 36 and 42 years old, were arrested after officers uncovered a 90% stripped blue BMW X1 SUV. “It had been reported hijacked from the owner in the Katlehong area at Mnisi section earlier on.” The two suspects face charges of possession of a hijacked motor vehicle. They men are expected to appear in the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court soon.
