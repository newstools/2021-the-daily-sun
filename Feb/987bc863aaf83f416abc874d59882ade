KAIZER Chiefs have finally got their wish as Caf acceded to their request to postpone their Caf Champions League fixture to 28 February. Amakhosi will finally meet Wydad Athletic at Al Salam Stadium in Cairo on 28 February, and not this coming weekend. The confirmation by Caf should come as a relief to Amakhosi, who could not travel to Morocco due to the strict Covid-19 protocols last week. They then proposed that the game be played at a later stage, as this will enable them to honour all the Champions League game on 23 February and the second one against Horoya on 5 March. The letter from Caf reads: “Kindly note that FRMF (Morocco FA) sent to Caf the approval of the Egyptian FA to host the match in Egypt. Noting the time challenge, it was not possible to organise the match between 16 and 19 February. After negotiating with all parties, a final decision was reached to play the match on the 28th of February in Egypt. “The Egyptian FA is kindly requested to confirm the stadium hosting the match as well as the kick-off time.” Amakhosi will play two league matches - against AmaZulu tonight and SuperSport United on Saturday - before they switch focus to the Caf competition.
