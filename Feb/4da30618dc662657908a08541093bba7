A FIRE at Carletonville Hospital has destroyed medical equipment and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The fire broke out on Thursday at an old building within the hospital that was used as a storage. Hospital CEO Sonwabo Lindani said there was a significant damage to the items stored, including some equipment for AngloGold Ashanti Hospital. Lindani said: “We are happy that no staff or patient casualties resulted from the fire. We have since replenished our PPE stock from our provincial warehouses.” He added that an investigation was currently underway. In a statement released by DA MPL Jack Bloom, the party was alarmed that the total value of PPE and medical equipment destroyed in the fire was worth about R20 million. “An independent investigation is needed to determine whether this fire was due to negligence or sabotage,” said Bloom.
