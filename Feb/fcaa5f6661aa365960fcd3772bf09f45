ACTION SA’s Herman Mashaba has urged parties to work together to remove the ANC from power. In a virtual message on Tuesday 9 February, he said: “We can’t afford more rhetoric that doesn’t present a plan that sees our country making progress. “I speak to the majority of South Africans, to say what you need to hear but won’t hear during Sona.” He was referring to the upcoming state of the nation address by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday, 11 February. “Despite the negativity, corruption and challenges, we must build an inclusive, more prosperous SA. Hope is not lost. “We must believe our country can be fixed. We must come together to start the hard work of getting SA working.” He wrote an open letter recently to opposition parties proposing a coalition excluding the EFF. “Hate-spewing socialists are not ever going to be part of the solution.” He said handling of the pandemic showed the ANC wasn’t capable. He said it was obsessing over alcohol and cigarettes, yet other countries were organising vaccines. He said it should have hired more medical workers, raised hospital bed capacity, and bought oxygen tanks and ventilators. “While on lockdown businesses closed and over 2,8 million jobs were lost. Government failed to honour these sacrifices. “Our people continue to suffer and cadres continue looting and getting rich.”
