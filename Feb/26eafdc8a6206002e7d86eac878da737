A GANG of four is still at large after robbing a bus driver of cash and commuters of their personal belongings in Mpumalanga on Friday, 12 February. Buscor company spokesman Vuyani Ndlovu told Daily Sun that the incident happened in Khomba in Nyongani near Hazyview, Mpumalanga, at 4am. While the driver was picking up commuters, criminals also boarded the bus. “The driver was caught unaware that the people he picked up at the bus stop were not ordinary commuters. Our passengers lost their belongings, and are traumatised by the incident. We are currently working with the police to identify the culprits,” said Ndlovu. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said as the commuters boarded the bus, a blue Toyota Tazz came and parked in front of the bus. “Four people alighted from the Tazz and rushed to board the bus. The driver thought they were also commuters who were late. But when tickets were requested, one of them produced a firearm, pointed at the driver and demanding cash, his wallet and a cellphone. The other three also produced firearms and pointed at commuters demanding their personal belongings,” Hlathi said. “The driver says the Tazz then moved from the front to the back of the bus. Its driver came out and demanded the second cellphone that the bus driver was hiding under the seat. The suspects fled the scene with the items, and are still at large. We request the community to assist us in the investigation of the case,” said Hlathi.
