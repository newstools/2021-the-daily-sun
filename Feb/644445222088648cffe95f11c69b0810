KAIZER Chiefs will be happy playing their away Caf Champions League Group C in neutral Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso against Wydad Athletic instead of in Morocco. Amakhosi were denied visas to enter Morocco last week by the Moroccan authorities due to the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa. This left the Confederation of Africa Football (Caf) in a tight spot trying to find a solution to the impasse. Now with the Burkina Faso FA coming to rescue the messy situation, Amakhosi will “visit” Wydad at Stade Du 4 Aout in that city on Sunday. However, it is a venue that has more good than bad memories for the Soweto giants. This venue in Ouagadougou is familiar to Chiefs veteran goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, club captain Ramahlwe Mphahlele and defender Erick Mathoho. The trio were part of Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba’s side that drew 1-1 with Burkina Faso in the first match of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers on 8 October 2016. Despite the draw, it was a milestone occasion for Khune. He earned his 80th cap for Bafana on that day, equalling Bafana leading scorer Benni McCarthy’s caps. In the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) tournament hosted in Burkina Faso, Bafana also played in that 40 000 seater stadium. They beat DR Congo 2-1 in the semi-final when McCarthy scored twice after the game had gone into extra time. However, aiming to defend their Afcon trophy they won two years earlier in 1996 in Mzansi against Egypt in the final, the Pharaohs proved too strong for Bafana. They beat Bafana 2-0 at the same venue. In the meantime, Chiefs opened their Group C account with a 0-0 draw against Guinea side Horoya at FNB Stadium on Tuesday.
