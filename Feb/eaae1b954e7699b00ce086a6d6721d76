PITSO Mosimane has continued writing his name in the history books. On Thursday night Mosimane lead his side Al Ahly to a historic 1-0 win over Fifa Club World Cup hosts Al-Duhail at Qatar's Education Stadium on Thursday. The victory saw the African Champions League winners booking their spot in the competition's semi-finals where they will face German giants and Champions League winners Bayern Munich on Monday. El Shahat's solitary goal proved the difference as the Egyptian's went into the break holding a narrow advantage. Mosimane remains unbeaten since stepping into the Al Ahly hot seat, having now won 19 of his 23 matches in charge and drawing the other four. With the win Mosimane created history as he becomes the first South African coach to guide a team to a victory in the Club World Cup and to book a spot in the competition's last four. Ahly qualified for the tournament by virtue of winning last seasonâ€™s CAF Champions League, while Al-Duhail represent the host country after winning the Qatar Stars League title. The Egyptians giants are taking part in their sixth Club World Cup, with their best finish coming in 2006, when they secured third place. The Red Devils will attempt to become the first African team to win the tournament, with only TP Mazembe (in 2010) and Raja Club Athletic (in 2013) reaching the finals. Meanwhile, Mosimane is taking part in his second Club World Cup after representing Africa at the tournament with Mamelodi Sundowns in 2016.
