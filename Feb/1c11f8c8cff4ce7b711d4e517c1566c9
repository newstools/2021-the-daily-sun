THERE is always a first time in everything we do in life and Bloemfontein Celtic goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane talks to us about his first experience on different issues. My first time in plane: It was in 2004 when I received a call-up in the Under-17 national team to play in Gambia. The had a great time on the plane and I was excited instead of being scared. I thought a flight was only used to get out of the country and never thought that we could also catch them to move around locally. My first boots: I can’t remember them properly, but I think it was a Nike boots that my mom bought for me when I was eight years old. I had them for a long time while I was attending primary school.My first vacation: I grew up in Polokwane, but my father used to work in Kempton Park, therefore we  took a family trip to Gold Reef City in Johannesburg. I always wanted to enjoy the rides and we had a fantastic day filled with laughter. My first job: I have never worked a different job in my life except for playing soccer. I sharpened my goalkeeping skills at the School of Excellence. My first contract: I was 18 year-old when Mamelodi Sundowns offered me a professional contract. It was a dream come true and a feeling that my football career was now a reality. My first gloves: I was in primary school when my mom bought me goalkeeper gloves. She was very supportive and I will always be grateful. My first kiss: I don’t want to share my first kiss with the public, that’s personal.
