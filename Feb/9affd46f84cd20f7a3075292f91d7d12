AL Ahly head coach Pitso Mosimane says the pressure on Bayern Munich ahead of their Fifa Club World Cup semi-final blockbuster on Monday (8pm). Ahly will face the European champions after booking a spot in the competition's last four with a 1-0 win over tournament hosts Al-Duhail on Thursday night. Talking after the victory Mosimane said that the German giants were massive favourites and that they were expected to win the tournament. “Bayern has got pressure, they must beat us, we don’t have pressure, so we are going to have fun,” said Mosimane. "Against Bayern Munich we should have fun I think, we have nothing to lose but everything to gain. "It's a very difficult match to go and win, against a big team who are champions who have won the Cup, the league and they've lifted the Champions League. He continued: "Imagine we win that match our lives would change. "Okay we did the same in Africa, we won the treble but they're Bayern. They've got pressure because they're expected to beat us where we don't have pressure."
