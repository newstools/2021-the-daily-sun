ZINHLE MABENA told Daily Sun she can’t begin to describe the trauma of spending a night in a holding cell. The case against her has been thrown out and she describes it as a sweet victory – but the best is yet to come. “I AM FREE AND GOING HOME TO REJOIN MY CHILDREN,” SHE SAID. On Wednesday morning, actress Zinhle Mabena (29) appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court in Tshwane on charges of attempting to murder her husband, Robert Ngwenya, and his bodyguard. But the prosecutor threw the case out and said her arrest was unlawful. Zinhle told Daily Sun she’d never seen the inside of a prison cell. “This was traumatic to say the least,” she said. Talking about the case, she said: “The prosecution have seen through the shenanigans peddled against me and have thrown the case out of court.” She said the victory was sweet and significant and she was going home to her children.  The Isibaya star thanked her family and friends. “I thank my family, close friends and legal team for their support and faith in my innocence, despite the despicable lies that are being spread about me,” she said. In a statement issued by her lawyer, Joshua Lazarus of Shapiro and Ledwaba Incorporated, Lazarus confirmed she was unlawfully taken into custody yesterday. “But she’s now a free woman after the NPA declined to place the matter on the roll because of the preposterous nature of the allegations against our client,” said Lazarus. He confirmed nothing plausible was provided to the authorities to link the client to any crime, including murder or attempted murder or any conspiracy. “The mischievous allegations ironically come from her husband, who she’s recently filed a divorce against, and against whom our client has obtained an interim protection order,” said Lazarus. At the time of going to print, Robert Ngwenya had not responded to the SunTeam’s calls or texts.
