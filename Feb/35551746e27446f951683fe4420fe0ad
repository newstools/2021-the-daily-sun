THE man who was accused of killing the mother of his four children will spend the rest of his life in jail. Lucky Mhlanga (34) from Piet Retief in Mpumalanga pleaded guilty to all charges levelled against him, admitting his guilt plea for violation of a protection order and murder when he appeared before the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court sitting at Breyten on Thursday, 11 February. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the victim, Zinhle Nkabinde (28), who was a domestic, did not report for work on the fateful day. Her employer then contacted her family to enquire of her whereabouts. But, they also did not know where she was. They then reported her as missing at the Piet Retief Police Station. The police, together with her family and some community members, began a search party on 10 February 2020, but with no success. The search continued, and her body was found in the bush at a farm near Mahamba on 15 February. Police investigations fingered Mhlanga as the main suspect, and he was arrested on 26 February. Hlathi further said the court heard how Mhlanga repeatedly physically abused Nkabinde to a point where she applied for a protection order. Despite the efforts she took to protect herself, he continued to make her life miserable to a point where on 26 December 2019, he physically assaulted her at a farm. She reported the matter to the police and he was arrested for violation of the protection order. “Mhlanga pleaded guilty on the murder charge and for violating a protection order. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with an additional five years. He was also found to be unfit to possess a firearm. Both sentences will run concurrently,” Hlathi said. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant general Mondli Zuma applauded the sterling work done by the investigation team, prosecution and judiciary in ensuring that Mhlanga received well-deserved sentences.
