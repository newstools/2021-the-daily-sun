MAMELODI Sundowns may have used Jwaneng Galaxy as a punching bag in their Caf Champions League opener. But now the real battle begins for the Brazilians when they open their group stage campaign with a tricky home fixture against Al Hilal at Loftus tomorrow (6pm). Unseeded in the draw last month, Downs found themselves in Group B where they are paired with powerhouses TP Mazembe, Al Hilal and CR Belouizdad. Al Hilal and Algeria’s Belouizdad may appear to be the easier of the group. But far from it. Hilal have improved in recent years in Caf competitions, having reached the semi-final and twice made it to the group stage in the last five years. They are no pushovers, as Rulani Mokwena alluded, and they could prove to be more than a banana skin for Masandawana in their quest for the knockout stage. One would think Mokwena, the Downs co-coach, is talking about a local PSL team when he dissects Al Hilal’s game plan, with some great insight into the opposition and how he thought they would play. “Al Hilal are not a closed book to us. We even watched their 1-0 Caf qualifier clash against Asante Kotoko. They also played a three-team tournament with TP Mazembe and Simba,” said Mokwena. “Unfortunately, they had some of their players in the squad for the Chan (African Nations Championship) tournament and were not part of the three-team tournament. We’ve profiled some of their players in the Chan. They’ve played eight games and are unbeaten with six wins and two draws. They are also a free-scoring team, averaging 2.6 goals per match and one point behind Al Merrikh in the Sudanese league.” So how are Sundowns going to counter the threat? “We’ve done our homework on them and have to translate that to match day,” said Mokwena. Sundowns have made the group stages in the last five editions and in the likes of Hlompho Kekana, Tebogo Langerman, Andile Jali and Denis Onyango have the necessary experience.
