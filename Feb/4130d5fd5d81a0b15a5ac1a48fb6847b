FOR the first time in the democratic history of this country, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini will not be part of the State of the Province Address this year. According to the royal household’s spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu, the king will not attend this two-day event on doctor’s order. “The king will not attend this event this year. This will happen for the first time in the history of democracy,” said Zulu. He said there’s nothing the king would have done because he had to follow the doctor’s order. “Even though he feels much better now, if the doctor’s instruction says he needs to rest, there is nothing the king can do except to respect the instruction,” said Zulu. KZN Legislature Speaker, Nontembeko Boyce, said they have been preparing for the address by His Majesty as well as the State of the Province address. “On Tuesday, 23 February, we received a formal letter from the royal household informing us that on medical advice, His Majesty will not be able to address the House,” said Boyce. She said they value the crucial role played by His Majesty. “As the legislature, we work extremely well with His Majesty and recognise that the guidance and counsel he provides to the legislature and government is invaluable. We take this opportunity to wish the monarch a speedy recovery,” said Boyce.
