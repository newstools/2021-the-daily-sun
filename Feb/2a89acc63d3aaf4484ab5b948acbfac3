NGIZWE “Zulu Charmer” Mchunu has shocked many people by saying he hoped his enemy Tshatha Ngobe returned to work. The former Ukhozi FM DJ and presenter of SABC1’s Roots announced on his radio station Ngizwe Online FM and his Facebook page that he was praying for Tshatha to return to Ukhozi. Ngizwe said it wasn’t right that Ukhozi fired both him and Tshatha, who specialised in traditional music. Ngizwe was fired by the station four years ago and Tshatha was suspended earlier last month. Tshatha got into trouble for writing on Facebook that Ukhozi FM robbed Shwi Nomtekhala of the song of the year award in 2005 and gave it to Malaika. Ngizwe has attacked Tshatha, his former best friend, a number of times over the years. He told Daily Sun they were no longer enemies. “If we are both axed by Ukhozi FM, who will stand for our traditional music? Even though we hate each other, the truth is that we can’t afford to both be gone from the station,” he said. Tshatha’s future at the station was still unclear and his fans were worried. Ngizwe and Tshatha used to present the show Sigiya Ngengoma together but were separated after they started fighting. Ngizwe was fired four years ago and started accusing Tshatha of not being a natural radio talent and impersonating former Ukhozi DJ Linda “Mr Magic” Sibiya. Tshatha returned to Sigiya Ngengoma in 2019. Tshatha had not responded to the phone calls, texts and WhatsApp messages at the time of going to print.
