THE mechanic was well-known for fixing cars. Many people arrived in the early hours when they needed their cars fixed because they knew how busy he was. On Wednesday, he woke up to do his daily task of fixing the cars in his yard. But things went terribly wrong. The 44-year-old mechanic, Antony Dimba fromKwaMancinza, north of Durban, was gunned down in his yard. It’s alleged Antony, who was known as Tony, was with a man who often came to help him fix the cars when two armed men opened fire. Tony died at the scene while the man who works with him was injured and rushed to hospital. Daily Sun went to Tony’s house but there was nobody there. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, told Daily Sun he was at his house when he saw two men firing shots at Tony. “The men fired shots and escaped on foot. I heard they got into a car on the main road but I’m not sure,” said the neighbour. Another neighbour said: “Tony was a close friend of the man Siya Ndlovu, who was gunned down with his baby mama and children a week ago at B section. “Maybe they’re being targeted for some reason that we don’t know.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said a murder was reported to Ntuzuma police. “The victim sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the body and was certified dead at the scene,” said Gwala. Charges of murder and attempted murder were opened at Ntuzuma Police Station for investigation.
