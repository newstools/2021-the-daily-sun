Commuters who use trains between Umlazi and KwaMnyandu train stations in KZN have been left stranded since Wednesday, 3 February. This comes after a feud started between Prasa and taxi bosses. According to Prasa spokeswoman, Carol Mokoaleli, the feud began a few days after they sent their fleet to transport commuters between Umlazi and KwaMnyandu. “The taxi bosses said they were not going to allow Prasa to use both the railway line as well as the road,” said Mokoeleli. She said the taxi bosses wanted the rail agency to allow them to transport train commuters whenever a need arose. “Prasa and taxi bosses previously had meetings about the matter, but no final agreement was reached. That’s why we ended up using our own fleet between Umlazi and KwaMnyandu train stations after a cable was stolen,” she said. Mokoaleli said they were doing this in an attempt to accommodate commuters who bought weekly train tickets. “They’re now stranded because we don’t have any other alternative way to transport them. Luckily, we met them immediately and explained the situation is beyond our control,” she said. Santaco KZN chairman, Boy Zondi, said they were not going to allow Prasa to take over their roads. “I’m sure they wouldn’t like us driving on their railway. The meetings that were previously started need to continue so that an agreement can be reached.” Commuter Zinhle Phungula said: “It’s inconvenient because when we pay for a weekly tickets, we think we are sorted for the rest of the week. But now we have to spend extra money to get to work.”
