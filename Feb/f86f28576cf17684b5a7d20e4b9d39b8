A FATHER has been arrested for the rape of the mother of his children. Police told Daily Sun that the victim was coming from Mpumalanga, bringing the children back to Joburg as schools were opening. She allegedly found him with another woman and there was an argument. Police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele said the other woman left their place of residence and the two slept in the same house. “While sleeping, the suspect allegedly forced himself on the victim without her consent,” he said. He confirmed that police arrested a 29-year-old man at his workplace on Monday, 15 February. “An investigation is underway and the suspect will appear soon in the Joburg Magistrates Court,” said Mbele. Joburg Central station commander Brigadier Irvin Perumal issued a stern warning to men saying if a woman says, no she means no, and that must be respected. “Even if she is your wife, sleeping with her without her consent is rape and police will not hesitate to effect an arrest,” said Perumal.
