SOME people refer to them as jugs, twins or babies. Whatever you call them, it is safe to assume that breasts are arguably the most apparent body feature on a woman. You will see this when a woman wears her sensual cleavage to bring her babies out to play. According to scientists, 47% of men first glance at a woman’s breasts, thus making them a sight to behold. Another sight to behold is Annie Hawkins-Turner, who is originally from Atlanta, Georgia. She boasts the world’s largest natural breasts, measuring in at 102ZZZ-cup and weighing 38kg each. They are described as each heavier than the average four-year-old child. The 57-year-old fetish model has held the Guinness World Record for her eye-catching voluptuous cleavage since 1999. Annie began developing breasts at the age of five, and by the time she was nine, they were a size 36D. She was diagnosed with gigantomastia, a condition that involves slow, progressive growth of breast tissue. In 2016, she marked 25 years of being a “boob-preneur” by launching a global model search for other women with super-sized real natural breasts.
