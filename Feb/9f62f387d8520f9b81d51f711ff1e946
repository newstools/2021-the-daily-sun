Once again we’re inundated with end-of-times predictions by prophets of doom. If we listen to them we’ll be led astray and not come up with solutions in our communities. The Creator, in His mightiness and loving kindness, formed the universe and everything in it for our benefit. Our delegated authority as the pinnacle of creation is to continue administering the earth well on His behalf. “Of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor son, but only the father.” Let’s not give room for unscrupulous self-made prophets to cash in on idle speculation. Of course, there will be signs of the times such as diseases not known before Covid-19. Nonetheless His agents, in the form of epidemiologists, scientists and doctors, will wrestle with the pandemic and come up with an effective cure. Ours is to obey them. Edenvale
