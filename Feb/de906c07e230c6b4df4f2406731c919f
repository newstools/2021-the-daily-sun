EASTERN Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane has axed health MEC Sindiswa Gomba for her alleged involvement in the Nelson Mandela funeral scandal. In a virtual media briefing on Thursday, 18 February at Bisho Massacre Memorial in Bisho, Mabuyane said: “I decided to release MEC Gomba from her duties as MEC of health. The decision to release her is to give her time to attend the case against her without any distraction.” Gomba, along with her 14 co-accused, are facing fraud and money laundering charges. It is alleged Gomba, who was a councillor in the Buffalo City at time, tried to defraud the municipality of millions of rands earmarked for the transportation of mourners to the various venues where memorial services were to be held for Mandela in December 2013. Co-operative Governance MEC Xolile Nqatha will step in as acting Health MEC. Mabuyane also announced that former provincial health boss, Dr Thobile Mbengashe faces a disciplinary inquiry in relation to the procurement of the controversial R10m scooters.
