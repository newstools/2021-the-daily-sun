I’VE often heard people talk about a thin line between right and wrong. Some people have said they walk on a tight rope because they enjoy living on the edge. Now if you’re good at reading between these thin lines, you will see that I’m driving towards a certain point about thin lines, which can also be seen in an underwear called the G-string. While some might debate if one is really wearing underwear in a G-string, fashion experts agree there are many benefits to wearing this sexy number: 1. Comfort While for some this might be debatable, those who do wear it insist on tiny, skimpy G-strings only as they prefer the feeling of comfort. 2. Great accessary From causal jeans to dressy trousers and little black dresses or pencil skirts, this underwear blends in perfectly like a chameleon in the wild. 3. Great for models Models on the catwalk who wear the tiniest G-strings during fashion shows prefer them as they deem them sexy and comfortable.
