NORTH West has aims to vaccinate 2,7 million of its 4 million people for Covid-19. Traditional practitioners and frontline health workers are said to be the first on the list of people who’ll receive doses. This was said by North West Premier Job Mokgoro during a media briefing in Mahikeng on Monday, 1 February. He said 34 frontline health workers were already in the queue for the vaccine. In total, the province has identified 21 vaccination sites. Mokgoro said these were all hospitals, which included two specialised hospitals and 16 district hospitals. He said they’d also prioritise vulnerable communities including people aged 65 years and older, and the elderly who live in old-age homes as well as their staff, prisoners and people who’re institutionalised. “I can confirm that we’ve completed vaccination allocation and ensured readiness of the vaccination sites,” he said. Health MEC Madoda Sambatha urged residents to make the conscious decision to get vaccinated. “That will help us reduce and manage numbers,” he said. All vaccinated people will be on a national register and be provided with a vaccination card.
