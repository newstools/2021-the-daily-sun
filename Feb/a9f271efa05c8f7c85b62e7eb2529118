THEY thought they were partnering in a new business and invested R24 000. But little did they know it was a scam. Nomvula Zwane (53) from Pretoria North was scammed in November while a white man stayed at her guest house. “A close friend asked me to accommodate the man and his two kids. I did because I trusted my friend,” she said. The man then proposed a business idea to her a few weeks later. “He sounded like he knew business, and I decided to invest. I gave him R10 000 to buy material for the business. I also borrowed him my bakkie and bought him a new cellphone,” she said. Nomvula said after the family left the guest house, they found their room dirty. “Some things were missing and I realised they ran away.” The man left with her bakkie, money, cellphone, TV and bedding. Nomvula then received a call from Adriette (47) and Werner Jordaan (54) , who said the man also ran away with their money. “They came to my place and we realised he scammed us the same way.” She said she wanted her car and money back. “He should be arrested.” Adriette and Werner said the man sounded genuine. “We met him at our home tutoring business where his kids attended. He told us about his business idea and we gave him R12 000 to partner with him,” they said. They said he used his kids to lure people. “The kids are in danger and need to be taken away from him. “We contacted the mother and she said the man had been scamming people,” said Adriette. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of car theft was opened at Pretoria cop shop and police were investigating.
