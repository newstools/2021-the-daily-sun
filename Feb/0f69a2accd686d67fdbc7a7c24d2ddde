FORD Motor Company will invest R15,8 billion in its South African manufacturing operations. This was to be the biggest investment in Ford’s 97-year history in the country. It also represented one of the largest investments in the South African automotive industry, which boosted Ford’s production capability and created new jobs. Ford announced the investment at a media briefing with its senior executives and President Cyril Ramaphosa. “This investment will further modernise our South African operations, helping them to play an even more important role in the turnaround and growth of our global automotive operations as well as our strategic alliance with Volkswagen,” said president of Ford’s international markets group, Dianne Craig. “Ranger is one of our highest volume, most successful global vehicles. This investment will equip our team with the tools and facilities to deliver the best Ford Ranger ever, in higher numbers and with superior quality,” said Craig. With this investment, Ford’s Silverton Assembly Plant was expected to generate revenue exceeding 1,1% of SA’s gross domestic product. The annual installed capacity at the Silverton plant would increase to 200 000 cars from 168 000, supporting the production of the all-new Ford Ranger bakkie for the domestic market, and exported to over 100 global markets. The plant would also manufacture Volkswagen Amarok bakkie as part of the Ford-VW strategic alliance.
