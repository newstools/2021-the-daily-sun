SOUTH African motorists are in for a huge petrol price hike next month. According to the Automobile Association (AA), bullish international oil prices are setting the stage for yet another hefty hike in fuel prices. Commenting on unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund, the association said the current picture shows month-end increases of up to 56 cents a litre for petrol, 47 cents for diesel, and 41 cents for illuminating paraffin. “Oil prices advanced at a leisurely pace during January, but the increase has quickened since then. International product prices shot up by around 8% in the first two weeks of February,” the AA added. “If oil continues on this trajectory, South Africa’s fuel prices might edge back into record territory in the medium term. Fuel users also remain vulnerable to economic shocks which might weaken the rand.”
