KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has described his side's shock defeat to minnows Richards Bay FC as "embarrassing." Chiefs were dumped out of the Nedbank Cup by the GladAfrica Championship side following a 2-1 loss at FNB Stadium on Sunday. The Natal Rich Boyz are just the latest lower league to shock the mighty Amakhosi in this competition. TS Galaxy and Baroka FC are some of the other teams who have done the same in the past. Hunt, who is enduring a tough first season in charge of the Glamour Boys, was bitterly dissapointed. "The first word that comes to mind is embarrassing," Hunt told SuperSport TV. "On a personal level I don't think I've ever lost to a first division side in my 26, 27 years as a coach."So it's embarrassing from that perspective, but they got a lifeline and we had so many opportunities and you've got to score when you play these teams like Richards Bay."You've got to score first and they got the upper hand but I still thought we should have had enough."We committed two bad errors at the back but in saying that you've got to take a good long look and you can't be delusional about these things.There's a lot but I don't want to say too much."I warned them the entire week building up to this game against any complacency and we had numerous chances in the first-half, but we just didn't make the final ball count."Even when we went down to ten men we still had numerous chances and you've got to do better.""If you give a few players a chance to play and they end up proving me right in why they haven't been playing that's why we were forced into making early changes."But then the ones we brought on have also got to do better."
