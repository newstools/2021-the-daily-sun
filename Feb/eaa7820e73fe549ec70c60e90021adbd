THE family of gogo Jester Nyathi is struggling to accept she’s gone but is grateful to have had her for 106 years. But the family is struggling to pay for her funeral and has appealed to Good Samaritans for help. Gogo Jester from Plaza View in Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, died in hospital on Sunday, 7 February. The family got help last March after Daily Sun published a story about how the gogo had to be pushed to the toilet in a wheelbarrow. The story touched former soccer player Gerald “Mgababa” Raphahlela and businessman Jonathan Marshal, who came to her rescue. At the time, Mgababa told the People’s Paper: “I immediately knew I had to do something, despite being in Limpopo while she was in Mpumalanga.” Gogo Jester was overjoyed when the SunTeam delivered two new wheelchairs donated by the men. At the time, she said her dream was to meet President Cyril Ramaphosa before she died. Her son, Thulani Mathebula, said the family was planning a huge celebration for the gogo’s birthday this year, but it was not to be. “Due to illness, she died in hospital and we’re pleading with Good Samaritans to help us with food for mourners. “Anyone who is willing to help can contact Mpho Mathebula on 072 390 2462,” he said.
