POLICE in Mpumalanga have sent a warning to the public to refrain from crossing flooded rivers or dams. The warning came after the body of Ndzalo Sibuyi (eight) was found floating in Simeleni River in Mashonamini trust near Mkhuhlu on Thursday morning. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the discovery occurred after police received a report that a boy went missing after trying to cross the river from Calcutta to visit his aunt at Mkhuhlu unit F. He never arrived, which left the parents worried. “On arrival at the scene, police found the victim in the river. The firefighter assisted to retrieve the boy’s body. He was unconscious, and the paramedic certified him dead. An inquest case was opened,” he said. “Police are worried by these incidents because since the beginning of summer, a number of children, between the ages of eight and 12, have drowned in different parts of Calcutta. We appeal to the public to avoid getting into flooded rivers and dams,” Hlathi added. “Parents are also urged to look after their children, more so now that they are rotating to go to schools due to the lockdown. We are experiencing heavy rain and more is still expected,” said Hlathi.
