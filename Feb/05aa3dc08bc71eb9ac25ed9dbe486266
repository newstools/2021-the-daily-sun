THE alleged mastermind behind Tshegofatso Pule’s murder is facing the law. Court proceedings were under way on the morning of Monday, 22 February and the suspect was appearing for the first time in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court. Muzikayise Malephane implicated him, saying he was an accomplice and put a hit out on the pregnant Tshegofatso. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters confirmed to Daily Sun the 32-year-old boyfriend was arrested on Thursday evening. Malephane confessed he’d been promised R70 000 to kill Tshegofatso, allegedly by the boyfriend, who didn’t want his wife to find out about Tshegofatso’s pregnancy.
