FOUR people, including three children, have died in a car crash on the N1 near Touws River in the Karoo, Western Cape early morning of Thursday, 11 February. A man and a woman who survived the crash were rushed to Worcester Hospital for treatment. Western Cape traffic spokesman Jandre Bakker said the car drove into a stationary truck that had broken down. “The crash occurred on the N1 close to Touws River. Preliminary reports suggest that a vehicle drove into the back of a stationary heavy motor vehicle that had broken down. Four fatalities have been reported, three of which are children under the age of five. Deanna Bessick, spokeswoman for the Western Cape Department of Health’s Emergency Medical Services, said they were told that a light motor vehicle drove into a stationary truck that broke down last night, 5km from Touws River in the direction of Laingsburg, near Sandhills train station in Worcester. “A call for assistance came through at 4.34am on Thursday, 11 February.
