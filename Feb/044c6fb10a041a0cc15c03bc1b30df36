TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) are on the verge of appointing Dylan Kerr to take over the vacant coaching job. The Englishman is expected to replace Joel Masutha who was sacked on Friday following a string of poor results. Although, Masutha had guided the Venda side to a hard fought 1-0 win over highly rated SuperSport United in the Last 32 round of Nedbank Cup last Thursday, TTM new boss Abram Sello had already made up his mind about bringing in a new mentor. Kerr was spotted taking TTM players through their paces at Louis Trichardt high school over the weekend. However, Kerr told Sunsport that he has yet to seal the deal with Sello. He revealed that his main concern was that the club was not financially stable. He said: “I am told that their financial situation is okay, that was my big problem. We only just started talking (about contract) and we will see what happens before the end of this week.” Kerr was in charge of TTM rivals Black Leopards where he was shown the door in January due to poor results.
