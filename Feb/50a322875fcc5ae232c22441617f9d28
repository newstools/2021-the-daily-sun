FORMER transport portfolio committee chairwoman, Dikeledi Magadzi, has admitted her committee didn’t do enough to curb corruption at Prasa. She told the Zondo Commission on Monday, 8 February one of the reasons they didn’t do oversight well was because they had to toe the party line. Magadzi said there was a proposal by a DA member in 2016 to establish an ad hoc committee to investigate allegations of state capture at Prasa and other entities by the Guptas, but the ANC voted against that. “When a party says this is the route you take, you can’t deviate from a route the party indicated you must follow.” She said they were met with challenges where they tried to get information about what was happening at Prasa. Prasa board chairman, Popo Molefe, apparently didn’t want to co-operate with the committee and accused them of interference. “He’d say we were overstepping with his fiduciary duties,” she said. Magadzi said only the chairman attended whenever they wanted to meet with the Prasa board. “The chairperson of that committee would not come even when we were dealing with issues of audit and risk. It would be the board chairman,” she said. She said Prasa kept spending money wastefully despite being warned. “To the dismay of the committee, many a times the issues that would be raised by the auditor-general or oversight committee would be repeated over and over again,” Magadzi told the commission. Commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said it was shocking that Prasa lost billions because of irregular expenditure. Irregular expenditure rose from R100 million in 2014 to R24 billion in 2019! “When I saw these figures they shocked me,” said Zondo. “This gives the impression that management at Prasa were saying we don’t care about what they say about irregular expenditure.”
