THE ugly war over a stolen song has led to maskandi star Khangelani “DSD” Mhlongo receiving death threats and going into hiding. Up-and-coming musician Jikeleza Khumalo recently accused DSD of stealing his song Kophelela Emkhukhwini, that he released in 2019. Jikeleza said when his song was featured on DSD’s album My Putsununu in December, he called him and he admitted to stealing it by mistake. He said they were supposed to meet in Joburg, where they both lived, at the beginning of last month but he never arrived. Jikeleza told Daily Sun that he didn’t want to go through the court because DSD was his role model and they both came from Nkandla, northern KZN. “I thought we could solve our problem at the meeting but he didn’t pitch as promised. We could have sorted it out easily. He is hiding at his rural home after running away,” he said. “Following the failed meeting, my manager Sibekezelo Mthembu called him, and that was where the ugly war of words started as DSD didn’t respect us.” Jikeleza said they were forced to take the matter to court. DSD, who is also the leader of award-winning group Osaziwayo, admitted to the SunTeam that he knew about the matter and was at home in Nkandla. “I was phoned by someone who insulted and embarrassed me by saying I don’t have money. He also made death threats,” he said. “I am at home cultivating and I will go to Joburg when I’m done. I’m not running away or scared. I’m just busy with my home.”
