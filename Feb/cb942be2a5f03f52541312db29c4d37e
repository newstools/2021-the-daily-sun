ITUMELENG Khune is back in the Kaizer Chiefs starting
line-up for their DStv Premiership duel against AmaZulu on Wednesday. The former number goalie returns to the poles after 10
matches, having last played in their 2-1 loss to SuperSport United on 15
December. Khune’s absence has drawn mixed reaction from the fans,
with some placing the blame squarely on his doorstep for poor results. But he has continued to knuckle down as he worked his way
back into the starting line-up. Chiefs are ninth on the log with 18 points while Usuthu
in seventh spot with 22 points. Full line-ups: Chiefs XI: Itumeleng Khune, Siyabonga Ngezana,
