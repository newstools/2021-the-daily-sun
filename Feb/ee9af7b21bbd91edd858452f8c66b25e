NOLWANDO Jack lost everything in a shack fire while visiting her boyfriend’s house. The 30-year-old from Siyahlala squatter camp in Philippi Browns Farm, Cape Town, told Daily Sun the fire started at about 4am on Friday morning, 5 February. “I went to visit my boyfriend on Thursday afternoon but I had to rush back on Friday morning after receiving a call from my neighbour saying my shack had burnt down,” she said. Nolwando said visiting her boyfriend saved her life because she could have died if she had stayed home. “When I sleep, I usually lock the door and it takes time to open. I’m glad I went to sleep at my boyfriend’s house,” she told the People’s Paper. Nolwando said the fire started at a neighbour’s shack and killed a 17-year-old boy. “I’m hurt about what happened, but at least I have been given another chance to live. “I lost everything but I can still replace my things, unlike the family that lost their son,” she said. The cause of the fire was unknown. Nolwando said she lost her kids’ stationery and school uniform. “I had already bought school stuff for my daughter. I don’t know where I’m going to get them again because I am not working,” she said. Nolwando pleaded for help to buy her daughter a new uniform. “I don’t know what my daughter will wear when the school opens. I also lost everything,” she said. “She will be doing grade 8 this year. I bought her the uniform and stationary early because I wanted her to look like other kids.” A 39-year-old resident said sleeping out saved Nolwando’s life. “After this, no one will complain if someone is going out because it could be saving lives,” said the resident.
