CHIEF Thandisizwe Diko, the husband of embattled presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko has died. Diko passed on yesterday night at the hospital. It is unclear what may have led to the untimely death of the amaBhaca King. While his wife Khusela didn’t post anything on the passing, messages of condolences flooded the Twitter streets. Zintle Diko: "Farewell Zulu, Khalimeshe, Nofisa." Keabetswe Manyobe: "Amabhaca King Madzikane II Thandisizwe Diko left us. Deepest condolences to the family and friends of the Dikos." Ms Ntfulini: "It is sad that Khuselwa Diko’s husband Thandisizwe Diko has passed away. My sincere condolences. In recent months, Diko has been embroiled in a PPE tender scandal which led to his wife being suspended at work. It’s alleged that Diko secured a lucrative R125 million tender, by way of political influence associated with his relationship to the presidential spokesperson to supply personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Gauteng department of health. It’s further alleged that, in addition to the glaring red flags of nepotism, Thandisizwe Diko inflated prices in an attempt to maximise profits. This is a developing story. Khusela Diko is going through a lot but she must pay for her husband, we want PPE money to save other families. pic.twitter.com/tif9kMPCaD  AmaBhaca Chief #ThandisizweDiko ll has passed away.
