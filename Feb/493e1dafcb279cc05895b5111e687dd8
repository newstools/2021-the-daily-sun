GOGO Jemina Maloi’s family have been struggling to get a death certificate since 27 April 2019. Nomasonto (45) and Johannes Mahlangu (48), the 74-year-old gogo’s children, haven’t been able to convince the Home Affairs office in Secunda to issue the certificate. The family from Greylingstad, outside Balfour in Mpumalanga, had to bury their mum three weeks later without one. The officials told them it won’t be possible as gogo Jemina shared an ID with someone who, according to their system, was still alive and that a three-month investigation was under way. “We can’t find closure. The officials at Secunda Home Affairs dragged us from pillar to post but refused to issue the certificate,” said Nomasonto. At the Home Affairs office in Tshwane, officials referred us back to the same office in Secunda. “We felt disappointed and hurt. Insurance companies refused to pay out money on her funeral policy because they insist on a death certificate we don’t have,” said Nomasonto. “Some of the insurance companies even cancelled the policies, suspecting us of trying to commit fraud.” Home Affairs manager Ndalisa Jele said they’d engaged with management at Secunda Home Affairs to give the necessary assistance to the family.
