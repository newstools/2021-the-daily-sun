LIFE is hard for Philda Mketu and her boyfriend Solomon Mqhokrwana, but they keep their love blazing. Philda (57) from Philippi in Cape Town told Daily Sun she and Solomon (52) are unemployed and survive by collecting empty plastic bottles on the street to sell to recycling companies. “With all these problems we face, we don’t allow anything to get between us,” she said. “Solomon is younger than me, but I respect him because he’s the man of the house and provides. “With the little money he gets, we’re still able to buy some bread.” The two used to drink together at a local shebeen, but took their relationship to the next level. “We used to be friends but then became lovers. It has now been more than 10 years,” she said. Philda said she’s too old to marry Solomon and just wants to keep their relationship as is. Solomon, who used to push a wheel bin around the kasi to collect bottles, decided to make a trolley. “It’s a little bigger and it carries more bottles. It’s also easy to push around. Now I get more money because I deliver more bottles,” he said. On a good day he makes R50 from plastic bottles, but slightly more if he finds cables. “Cables from microwaves and other electrical gadgets pay a little more, but I rarely find them. “If I’m lucky and get those, I can make around R80 per day.” The two don’t have children together, but Solomon lives with Philda and her kids. “I wake up early in the morning to search for bottles from one bin to another,” he said. Philda said she sometimes goes with Solomon to help push his wooden trolley.
