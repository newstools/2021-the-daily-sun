UMLAZI township, south of Durban, has turned into a filthy kasi with flies seen all over the place. According to terrified residents, eThekwini municipality employees rendering the service of collecting refuse have not shown up since the beginning of the week. Nokuthula Jokweni, resident and street vendor at Zwelethu Train Station, said the problem was beginning to affect their business. “I sell fast foods right next to where residents throw their refuse. Before we had this problem, selling next to the spot where people throw their refuse was not a problem because it was being collected. But now that it isn’t, I am beginning to have a problem because maggots crawl into my container,” said Jokweni. Another vendor Sanele Dimane, whose fruit stall was also situated next to the pile of refuse, said flies flew from the refuse to rest on his fruits. “This causes my fruits to rot quickly and moreover, people are avoiding buying because they fear that these fruits might harm them,” said Dimane. These vendors said the municipality needed to something about the problem because it was affecting their businesses, which were their only hope to put food on the table. Municipality spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said the city wished to apologise to residents of Umlazi for the non-collection of refuse. “The service was interrupted due to threats posed to our city employees rendering the service by an unknown business forum grouping. We urge residents to keep their refuse bags in their properties until notice of resumption of services is communicated,” said Mayisela. He said the municipality was working around the clock to get a solution. “The municipality regrets any inconvenience caused.”
