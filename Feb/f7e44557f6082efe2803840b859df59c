Motorists in the North West have been urged to
avoid the N18 between Vryburg and Taung after it flooded on Thursday. The flooding was as a result of torrential rains in
the province. "Tygerkloof and Brussels on the N18 are
reported to be flooded. Members of the Disaster Management team in the Dr Ruth
Segomotsi Mompati District have been dispatched to all affected areas to
provide the necessary assistance," said North West Cooperative Governance
and Traditional Affairs spokesperson Dineo Mohlakoana. Mohlakoana said the province was expecting more
rain in the coming days and urged residents to co-operate with law enforcement. "Motorists and pedestrians should avoid
crossing flooded streams and rivers. Motorists are also requested to use
alternative routes or cancel their trips until it is safe to travel." News24
