Leadership comes with responsibility. If you are not well-equipped and responsible, no success will be achieved. Corruption and leadership will never be intertwined. Mzansi leaders have failed us from the beginning. The ANC sold us to whites and has been gambling with our lives since 1994. Citizens are dying due to Covid-19, yet our leaders buy vaccines that are due to expire in a few months. BENEFITS OF WEARING A G-STRING! What kind of carelessness is this? South Africa is paying the price, and it is the citizens who will suffer the consequences of neglect from their leaders. There’s no proper leadership in SA. This country is being misled. How do you buy vaccines that are ineffective, and only discover their expiry date when they have already arrived in the country? How much has been paid for all the vaccines to be transported to South Africa? WATCH: SOCCER PLAYERS FLASH THEIR 4-5s! It’s time to remove careless leaders from higher positions as this does not reflect the image of the country in a reputable manner, but allows other countries to play us for fools. The country needs someone with good leadership qualities, not sell-outs who only lead to benefit their pockets. We will live to pay the price. God will punish us until all the corrupt leaders are removed from their positions. Our leaders are incompetent and know they can get away without accounting for their blunders. In any decently run democracy, the health minister or the president would be on the chopping block, but not in Mzansi. Clearly the battle to defeat this virus is all in our hands.
