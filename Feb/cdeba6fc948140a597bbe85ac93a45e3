WHEN commuters use taxis they never think they’ll get robbed. But they find themselves forced to disclose their bank PIN numbers at knife or gunpoint. The thugs then clean out their bank accounts before throwing the injured victims out of the taxi. Ekurhuleni Metro cops have warned people to be vigilant. Spokesman Kobeli Mokheseng said they’d been receiving calls from alleged victims who were robbed in moving taxis, in and around Ekurhuleni. “A woman in her late 20s claimed she took a taxi next to the Reef Shopping Mall on 23 January, going to Germiston CBD,” said Mokheseng. “A white Toyota Quantum with five male occupants including the driver stopped. “Four passengers took out dangerous weapons while the taxi was in motion, and assaulted her. “She was robbed of her jewellery, cellphone, R450 and a bank card. Thugs accessed R1 000 from her banking app, which was immediately withdrawn before dropping her off next to the cemetery in Primrose, injured and confused.” Mokheseng said eventually a Good Samaritan found and took her to the nearest police station. “She was then rushed to the nearest hospital,” he said. The woman later learnt the criminals had accessed her second bank account and went on a shopping spree of almost R10 000. Mokheseng said this was suspected to be a syndicate. In a separate incident, a man in his 30s on 5 February boarded a taxi on Sontonga Road next to Caltex petrol station in Katlehong. He was destined for Germiston. Thugs in a white Toyota Quantum used the same modus operandi. Mokheseng said police and Metro cops are investigating.
