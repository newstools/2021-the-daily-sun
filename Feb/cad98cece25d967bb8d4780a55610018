THE confusion surrounding the funeral of slain former bantamweight boxing champion ended yesterday when he was buried. Fans of former South African champion Phindile “Slow Poison” Gaika (62) of KwaZakele kasi in Port Elizabeth were frustrated and didn’t know when he will be buried. His funeral was supposed to be held last Friday, but the service was postponed because the family didn’t have enough money to bury him. The former champ died on 25 January after he was attacked and shot eight times at his home by two unknown hitmen. He was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery yesterday. His funeral was held at his home and the speakers described him as a good man. Eastern Cape province Boxing South Africa chairman, Nceba Dladla told the mourners: “Phindile died when we are reviving boxing in the metro through the boxing veterans.” His friend former Transvaal flyweight champ, Pilly Duiker said: “We first met when we were both 13 years old and we boxed our way up. “Phindile was the first amateur boxer to win a national title and he also won the South African title at professional level,” he said Phindile’s first-born son, Lubabalo, said: “We received money late due to Covid-19 pandemic. “My father was a good man and he loved his grandchildren. He is survived by nine children and 16 grandchildren and we will miss him.” Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swarts said: “Cops are investing the case.” But she refused to comment further.
