BAFANA BAFANA star Percy Tau knows just how important Brighton and Hove Albion’s game against Crystal Palace is this evening (10pm SA Time). The Seagulls welcome rivals Crystal Palace to the Amex knowing that a victory would see them overtake the Eagles in the table. Palace have won three of their last six away league games against Brighton. But Tau and his teammates are looking to put a stop to that run. Tau, who could feature in his first derby since joining the English club, was sent a strong message. “I’ve heard about it, even at the hotel I was told ‘we need to win that games’,” said Tau in an interview by his club. “I have never heard them speak to me before but then against Crystal Palace they told me the message was clear, we need to win that game. “I heard it’s quite a big game for us, it’s a derby. But I think the team will be prepared for that game."
