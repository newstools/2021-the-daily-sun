Cape Town Spurs have appointed Ian Taylora as head coach. Taylor replaces former coach Vladislav Heric, who mutually agreed to end his working relationship with the Urban Warriors last month. Taylor recently returned to Ikamva following three years in China. Taylor rose through the coaching ranks at Ikamva before working as assistant and eventually caretaker coach of the club’s first team. The former Spurs player also enjoyed two spells as head coach of Cape Town All Stars before joining Cape Town City as an assistant coach to Eric Tinkler and later Benni McCarthy. The 44-year-old will be assisted by Cape football legend Nathan Paulse. “The main objective is to get the structure and organisation right in the team – trying to get the balance right, and at the same time, trying to get the results,” said Taylor on his club's website. “We’re taking it one game at a time and trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves. It’s a matter of playing out of our organisational structures basically – and working on elements of conditioning and scoring, which we’re lacking.”. Paulse added: “Look, I think there’s a lot of hard work that lies ahead of us, but I think we’re on a good track. At this point we can’t look too far ahead, we need to micromanage this season and take it game by game with thorough analysis and weekly targets that we need to set in terms of our environment, culture and harmony in the squad that will lift the quality of our performance. “It’s obvious that the players haven’t had a good pre-season, and obviously with Covid-19 there are a lot more obstacles but it’s a balancing act of how we can lift the quality towards each game. But we’re enjoying the process and I’m sure the players are embracing it from what we have seen. From there we can only go towards each game and work hard towards getting those three points.”
