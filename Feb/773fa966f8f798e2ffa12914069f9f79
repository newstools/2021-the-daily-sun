MEC for Public Transport and Roads Infrastructure Jacob Mamabolo welcomed the arrest of suspects linked to taxi violence in Atteridgeville in Tshwane. Mamabolo said on Thursday, a task team arrested four suspects linked to the killing of three taxi operators and recovered two illegal firearms, ammunition and stolen cellphones. He added that on Wednesday, an intelligence-driven investigation by the task team led to the arrest of members of a security company from KwaZulu-Natal and recovered assault rifles. “It is suspected that the company is linked to taxi-related violence that was expected to erupt in Ennerdale,” he said. Mamabolo has issued a stern warning to those who pay hitmen and stoke the fires of violence that the law was closing in. “We are working very hard with law-enforcement agencies to ensure that no stone is left unturned in uncovering the plots, and arresting those who are responsible. The law will prevail,” he said.
