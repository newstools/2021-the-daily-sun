WHEN he saw his 28-year-old girlfriend busy on her cellphone on Friday last week, he accused her of texting her ex-boyfriend. When he demanded to see her phone and she refused, the man allegedly stabbed her twice in the upper body with a screwdriver, killing her! Captain Bernard Matimulane of Ivory Park Police Station in Joburg said a 32-year-old suspect was bust for murder after the incident at the home he shared with his girlfriend. “After the incident, the suspect tried to flee but community patrollers caught him and handed him over to the police,” he said. Ivory Park station commander, Brigadier David Mbongeni Ngcobo, said he was shocked to hear of the murder but thanked the community patrollers for their quick response and for ensuring the suspect didn’t escape before the police arrived. The suspect is expected to appear in the Tembisa Magistrates Court soon on a charge of murder. Ngcobo appealed to anyone in an abusive relationship to seek help as early as possible. “I’m saddened to hear the deceased was in an abusive environment for some time and none of the people close to her thought of calling us for an intervention,” he said. Ngcobo said GBV is a massive problem and communities need to be the eyes and ears of the police to help stamp it out. A neighbour said: “There are so many things one can do on a phone. “It doesn’t mean if you’re busy on a phone you’re texting a man. Clearly you can see how unreasonable this man was.” Another neighbour said: “Men should understand that a phone is a personal, and they must not attack women for chatting on their phones.”
