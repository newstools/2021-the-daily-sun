OF THE first batch of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines that arrived in the country on Monday, Limpopo will receive about 44 000 units and 39 facilities which deal with Covid-19 patients will receive the doses. Healthcare workers who deal directly with Covid-19 patients will be first in line to be vaccinated. Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba said she is also ready to be vaccinated and encouraged everyone to follow suit. “Primary prevention of Covid-19 is not limited to behavioural changes. “I’d like to encourage everyone to join in this step towards stopping the spread of the virus by being vaccinated.” Ramathuba urged people not to be misled by false information. She said there was no microchip or tracking device of any kind in the vaccine. “Don’t be left out when the mass vaccination takes place,” she said. “Let’s vaccinate and help save lives because our health remains our responsibility.” The South African Medical Association Trade Union in Limpopo said the majority of its member doctors are willing to take the vaccine and those that don’t want to take it will not be forced to do so. Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha said people must trust the vaccine without any doubt. “The province is ready to roll out the coronavirus vaccine programme to curb the spread of the pandemic. “We urge everyone to be part of this critical measure in the fight against this virus,” he said.
