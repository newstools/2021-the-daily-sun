LESEDI FM current affairs news anchor Dimakatso Ratselane is fighting for her life in hospital. This is after she was involved in a quarrel with her husband, who allegedly then stabbed and left her for dead. The incident allegedly happened on Tuesday while they were on their way to fetch their children. Free State police have since opened a case of attempted murder. Police spokesperson Motantsi Makhele told EWN that when Ratselane was found, she was covered in blood, indicating that she had suffered multiple stab wounds, and she couldnâ€™t speak. He added that they had allegedly quarrelled while on the way to fetch their children. They ended up in an informal settlement popularly known as Dinaweng. Makhele said Ratselane was found by community members and friends in a critical condition around midnight. He said she was taken to hospital but her husband, who is a suspect, was still at large. Police have appealed to anyone who might know the whereabouts of the suspect to call Crime Stop or provide information via the MySAPS app.
