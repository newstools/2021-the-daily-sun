GOLDEN Arrows coach Mandla Ncikazi has run out of superlatives to describe the brilliance of his young team. Ncikazi said he was proud of his boys after another confident performance to dispatch Stellenbosch 3-1 in a DStv Premiership match at Danie Craven Stadium on Friday. Abafana Bes’Thende’s win has seen them move to third on the table with 28 points after they completed the first round of the season. After 15 league games, this is their best ever return of points at the halfway mark. “The effort they are putting is incredible,” said Ncikazi. “It’s good that the club is scoring, it’s good that we are within our objectives. I just want to see this team continue the way they are working and let’s see where it takes us. But I’m really proud to lead this team.” Ncikazi was happy to see Michael Gumede, who only scored one league goal last season after joining Arrows from Richards Bay, was among the scorers after going through some “personal issues”. “I’m happy for Michael. He has gone through a lot in his life and personal stuff,” said Ncikazi“ There’s an understanding between him and Knox Mutizwa. They are sharing the top spot and it is good for the team to have two strikers working hand in hand like that.”
