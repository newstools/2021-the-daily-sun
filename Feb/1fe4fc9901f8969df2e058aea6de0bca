UMALUSI has
approved the release of the 2020 national examination results. This was
announced at a media briefing in Tshwane on Monday 15 February. The quality
assurance council’s CEO Mafu Rakometsi said after a long and difficult academic
career, quality assurance and management of the exams were successful. He said the
2020 academic year would go down in history as the most difficult since Mzansi
became democratic. “Due to the
Covid-19 lockdown regulations, assessment bodies were forced to postpone
mid-year exams to the November end-of-year examinations,” he said. Rakometsi
said this increased the number of pupils writing national exams and as a
result, the class of 2020 became the largest ever to sit for the November
national exams. “The
quality of question papers is a very important
aspect of the integrity and credibility of the examination. It is, therefore,
pleasing to see a marked improvement in the overall quality of question papers that
were submitted by some of the assessment bodies,” he said. However, he
said the council was deeply disappointed that mathematics paper 2 and physical
sciences paper two were leaked. “Once
again, Umalusi appeals to all stakeholders involved in the examination process
no to engage in such acts of dishonesty,” he said. “Umalusi
takes a dim view of paper leakages as they have the potential to compromise the
integrity and credibility of the entire examination. “It is also
worth noting that there are serious consequences for those who are found guilty
of such criminal activities, regardless of whether they are pupils or
officials.” Rakometsi
also conveyed his condolences, on behalf of Umalusi, to teachers, pupils,
principals and support staff at schools, colleges and ABET centres, as well as
officials, who lost friends, relatives and colleagues to Covid-19.
