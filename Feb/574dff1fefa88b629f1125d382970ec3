IT will take some serious effort to stop the Mamelodi Sundowns juggernaut... it seems. The Tshwane giants successfully carried their impressive domestic form into the Caf Champions League once again. They eased past Algeria’s CR Belouizdad 5-1 in their second CAF Champions League Group B match at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium on Sunday. Themba Zwane scored a brace while Peter Shalulile, Lebohang Maboe and Kermit Erasmus all bagged a goal each to hand Downs a convincing win over Belouizdad. They stretched their amazing run to 11 matches without defeat in all competitions. They are now in a strong position in their group, perched at the top with two wins from as many matches. Downs have a perfect record in this competition after they beat Sudanese side Al Hilal in their first group match in Tshwane a few weeks ago. Their opponents on the day, Belouizdad, have picked up only one point so far from their clash against TP Mazembe in Kinshasha. They were no match for rampant Downs, who sent out a strong message to the rest of their rivals in the competition. Downs showed no signs of being an away team as they romped to an early lead through Zwane’s penalty. The third-minute red card for Belouizdad’s Chouaib Keddad as a result of his foul that led to the penalty only made the task that much easier for Downs. Amir Sayoud’s equalizer on the stroke of half-time was eventually nothing more than a consolation goal. Downs turned on the style in the second half as Shalulile headed them in front before Zwane completed his brace. Maboe then scored the fourth goal before Erasmus added some gloss to the scoreline and put the final nail in Belouizdad’s coffin. Sundowns next face Mazembe at the Stade TP Mazembe on Saturday (3 pm) looking to continue their fine form.
