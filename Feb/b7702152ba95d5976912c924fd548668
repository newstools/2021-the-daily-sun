ABC Motsepe League teams are eagerly awaiting the start of new season, having last played competitive matches before March last year. This was due to the outbreak of Covid-19 that led to the amateur football being momentarily stopped. The South African Football Association (Safa) finally received the green light from government to resume all amateur football. The good news was welcomed by all the clubs affiliated to the Motsepe League in nine provinces. Ablex United boss Alex Abureni is delighted that his boys will finally do what they love most, playing football to achieve their goal of gaining promotion to the GladAfrica Championship. Abureni bought the status of Polokwane United in 2019-20 season following a stint in the SAB League. Ablex will resume their campaign with a Limpopo derby against rivals Monaca FC on 7 March. Said Abureni: “I was disappointed when amateur football was suspended due to the pandemic. There was nothing we could do than to stay at home to avoid putting our lives in danger. My boys have been working hard at training to ensure we start the season on a positive note. “Our aim is to gain promotion at the end of season and stay in the Championship for three years then gain promotion to the big league in our fourth season.” Ablex have signed former Free State Stars striker Thapelo Mkhatshwa, winger Daclen Ngwetjana from Championship side Uthongathi and Mawelewele Takalani from Vaal University to help them reach their target. Explained Abureni: “The three players will add value to the team because they played at the higher level. “They’ll also guide the 14 youngsters that we have in the team. Our target is to collect 18 points in the first round to stay in the race for promotion. We beat Monaco twice and I have no doubt we can do it again to motivate the team going forward.”
