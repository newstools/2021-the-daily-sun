FOR two years thugs have been breaking into her shack. And they always make off with a few items. But this time Nompumelelo Mphuge was shattered when thugs took off with her son’s school uniform. Thugs broke into her shack on Friday while she was visiting her mother. She returned to find her shack ransacked and her son’s new school uniform gone. “Schools are opening on Monday (today). Where will I get money to buy another school uniform?” she said. The 21-year-old from Spooktown in Bekkersdal said she’d packed the uniform, stationery, lunch box and books in a school bag. “I don’t work and bought everything with grant money I saved,” she said. Nompumelelo spent more than R600 on the uniform, stationery, lunch box, school shoes and stationery. She suspects the person who broke into her shack knows her. ALSO READ: SABC

BACK TO IMPRESS! “Thugs own this place. Some of us don’t report cases anymore,” said resident Menzi Ngubane (34). “We know they’ll be out in the streets the following day. It’s a waste of time.” Sergeant Linkie Lefakane advised Nompumelelo to open a case so the police could investigate.
