BLACK Leopards coach Lehlohonolo Seema has warned his players to expect a tough clash when they face on-form AmaZulu in the Nedbank Cup last-16 at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Despite being second bottom on the DStv Premiership log, Leopards come into this clash full of confidence following their 2-1 win against Golden Arrows in a league encounter at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Tuesday. But Seema admitted that Usuthu, who have been in a good form since the Bafana Bafana legend Benni McCarthy took over the helm, are a stronger side than Arrows. Usuthu have not lost a game in their last consecutive eight matches. The last time the Durban-based side tasted defeat was in their 1-0 defeat against Kaizer Chiefs on 13 January. “AmaZulu are a difficult team to beat,” said the former Orlando Pirates captain. “You can see that they are a changed team since McCarthy took over last December. So we are expecting a tough game and we need to be at our best and avoid making mistakes if we are to beat AmaZulu. “But the good thing is that the confidence is back from the boys after our win against Arrows, which is what we needed. “I am positive that if we play our game and work harder, we will advance to the next stage of this competition.” Seema will be relying on his two strikers Mohammed Anas and Rodney Ramagalela to help Lidoda Duvha advance to the quarter-finals of the Ke Yona Cup. The good news for the former Bloemfontein Celtic and Chippa United coach is that his Ghanaian striker, Anas seems to have found his scoring boots again after he netted a brace against Arrows. However, Leopards defence need to be tight to stop AmaZulu stars Luvuyo Memela, Lehlohonolo Majoro and Augustine Mulenga from scoring. The on-form Memela has netted six goals for AmaZulu this season, while Majoro has scored five. The last meeting between the two sides saw Usuthu win 2-0, with Memela scoring a brace.
