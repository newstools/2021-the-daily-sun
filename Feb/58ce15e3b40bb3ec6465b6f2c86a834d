HE has already scored NINE goals in all competitions since he joined Mamelodi Sundowns from Highlands Park. And Peter Shalulile was a prolific striker even at Highlands Park, ask then coach Owen Da Gama who referred to him as the best striker in the country, ever. But Shalulile is more driven by pressure when his team is on a tight corner. Against Stellenbosch FC, which the defeated 3-2 on Wednesday in a tightly contested Nedbank Cup last-32, Shalulile scored two goals. And he explains what drove him: “We grinded out the results. It was not easy, my teammates kept on pushing me and the technical staff. I give credit to them because they kept on believing in me and for that, I had to push an extra mile." He told SuperSportTV: "We are a team that dominates the ball on the pitch, we did what we had to do, keep on playing and make sure that they give us the pockets. And we managed to get them and scored the goals.” The Namibian finished the past campaign as a joint top goal-scorer with Orlando Pirates' Gabadinho Mhango - with 16 goals each. And in the new 2020-21 DStv Premiership, the Namibian has continued with his goal-scoring spree.
