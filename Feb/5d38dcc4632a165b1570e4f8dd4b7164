A FAMILY from Umlazi, south of Durban believes someone wants to finish them off. This comes after they found a knife, coins, egg shells and muthi buried in their daughter’s grave. The knife was tucked on the left side of the grave, with the sharp part facing down. The coins were placed behind the cross, the egg shells were placed at the bottom, while the muthi was placed in a blue plastic bag on top of the grave. The grave belonged to a woman who died in 2009. She was buried at Zwelethu Cemetery in Umlazi. Her mum said she complained of isibhobo (a sharp pain below the ribs) before she died.  “The pain was so sharp she couldn’t breathe. She was dead within two days. I couldn’t even take her to hospital.” As if that was not enough, the mum has since lost six kids, two grandkids and her husband, who all complained of isibhobo. “We heard strange noises before my husband’s death, which sounded like a wild bird, but we couldn’t see it. He then had a seizure and was unconscious for two to three days,” she said. “I lost one of my daughters in April and she left behind two kids. One of my grandkids complained of isibhobo and is now in hospital.” The woman and her daughter consulted inyanga. The daughter said: “He told us someone’s bewitched our family. He told us the sharp pain came from a knife buried in my sister’s grave. He also told us someone used a coin to sacrifice our souls to evil spirits.” She said they asked him to send back the evil spirit to the sender. He said he’d heal the family and send the evil back to the sender.
