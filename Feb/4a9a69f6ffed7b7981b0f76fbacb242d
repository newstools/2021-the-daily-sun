The battle between DJs Fresh and Euphonik, and their rape accuser, is far from over. This after Euphonik recently tweeted a screenshot of her apologising, saying the alleged rape was all a lie. “Themba, I am sorry for what I did to you and DJ Fresh,” the text read. “The people who made me do this are turning their backs away from me because the lawyers want to push this further. The truth will come out, but it was a lie and I don’t know what to do because I’m scared of getting arrested. Journalists are calling me every day. Please forgive me.” ALSO READ | TOP UZALO ACTOR LOSES HIS VOICE Responding to the text, Euphonik tweeted: “On a serious note, before things really get out of hand, can this girl’s family and friends help her before she hurts anyone else or herself? Unfortunately, my sister, what you said and did damaged us way too much to expect any level of help from me.” The alleged victim then replied, tweeting that she had not sent the message. “Why would I send someone a message with my number? Euphonik, you want to play dirty? Bring it on! Kudala ndithule ndikuyekile [I’ve been quiet for too long], and andikoyoki [I’m not scared of you].” On a serious note. Before things really get out of hand. Can this girl's family and friends help her before she hurts anyone else or herself? Unfortunately, my sister you’ve said, done and damaged way too much to expect any level of help from me. pic.twitter.com/EJ8suGYmHd — Euphonik™?
