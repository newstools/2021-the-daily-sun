THE axing of former health MEC Sindiswa Gomba by Premier Oscar Mabuyane should be welcomed and praised. Gomba is facing serious charges of fraud and money laundering relating to Nelson Mandela’s funeral. When are we going to see these corrupt politicians serving jail time? I will only be happy if they go to jail. There’s a difference between an arrest and being sentenced to jail. We’ve seen many politicians being arrested, but never go to jail. Instead, the implicated leaders get positions somewhere under the guidance of the ruling party. Firing corrupt officials only from their positions isn’t enough. Wherever they go they’re given other top positions, so they can continue with corruption again. That’s why corruption will never end in Mzansi and in the ruling party.
