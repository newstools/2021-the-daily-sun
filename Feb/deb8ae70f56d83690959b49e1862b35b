Three
suspects have been sentenced to 16 years imprisonment for kidnapping and
dealing in drugs. The three,
including a former police officer, were found guilty in the Bloemfontein
Regional Court. Moleboheng
Precious Mohasoa, 29, a former police official attached to the Protection and
Security Services; Innocent Paki Kompi, 31; and Napo Moses Mohasoa, 33, were
sentenced to 16 years in prison on Monday. "Their
conviction emanates from the incident which took place in November 2016, where
the trio coerced a victim to assist them in manufacturing drugs. The victim,
who was a chemistry student at the University of Free State, later reported the
matter to the police after he escaped from the house where he had been kept
against his will," said Hawks Captain Christopher Singo. The Hawks
carried out a search and seizure operation at the premises where the victim was
kept. The
suspects were arrested at the premises and drugs were found concealed in a
safe. The
suspects were sentenced to 15 years on a count of kidnapping, with an
additional year for the drug dealing charge. SOURCE: NEWS24
