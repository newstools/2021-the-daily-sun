A 31-YEAR-OLD man has been sentenced to four life terms and a further 125 years for a string of rapes. Serial rapist Siyabulela Mkayo, from Alexandria in the Eastern Cape, was sentenced by the Grahamstown High Court on Monday after being convicted for raping eight women, assault and robbery. His victims were aged between 16 and 47, and his reign of terror started in 2012 at Ndzayi kasi in Alexandria and ended in 2018. Police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni said: “Mkayo’s first victim was walking alone at night when he followed her armed with a knife. He assaulted her from behind, punched and slapped her. He took her cellphone and cash. The assault continued as he dragged her to a nearby bush and raped her. “His spree of terror continued using the same modus operandi. He was ultimately arrested when he raped and assaulted his last victim, an 18-year-old teenager. He was linked through DNA evidence to seven of the rapes. He was arrested and remained in custody until he was sentenced,” he added. The trial began last Monday and this week, Judge Gerald Bloem sentenced him for eight counts of rape, five of robbery with aggravating circumstances as well as two counts of common robbery. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga praised Detective Warrant Officer Mlulami Mafani for his meticulous use of technology and investigation aids that resulted in the arrest, conviction and welcome sentence. She said: “The appropriate use of DNA evidence not only led to the outcome, but also helped solve other cold cases of rape that were committed by the perpetrator in Alexandria.”
