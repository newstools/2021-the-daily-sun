Dear MizzB My partner had an affair two years ago and I found out about it. He promised to break up with the lady and I forgave him. I just found out he’s been providing for this lady financially all along. Does this mean he loves her? Dear Sista Keeping a promise to your partner is one of the acts that show you care about their feelings. Various reasons can make your partner keep this arrangement going. Jumping to conclusions can mislead and give you the wrong impression. So, it’s best to talk to him and allow him a chance to explain his side of the story before taking any drastic step. It’s tricky to associate money with love as he could still provide for her without being in love with her. It’s been said that actions speak louder than words, and only he can be able to clarify what’s going on. All the best!
