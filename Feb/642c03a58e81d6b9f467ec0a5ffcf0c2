ARTIST Sizani Baloyi uses his amazing skills and talent to tell a story of his humble beginnings through his beautiful lino prints. Sizani (27) from Snake Park, Soweto, said he developed the love of art at an early age. “As a youngster in grade 3 I already loved animation and my destination as an artist was sealed,” he said. “I taught myself this craft depicting life in informal settlements. I want to restore the dignity of those living there.” Sizani uses scooping tools, ink, fabriano paper and printed pressings to do his art work on a clear white paper background. “I hope to be successful and rise from humble beginnings and achieve the goals in my life,” he said. “I hope my work will make people think, evoke their emotions and to create debate about inequalities of the past. I try to highlight the plight of those who stay in the informal settlement.” He studied art at Artist Proof Studio in Newtown to sharpen his skills. His work can be found displayed at Fourways Art Eye Gallery in Joburg.
