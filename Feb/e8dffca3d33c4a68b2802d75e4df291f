A 59-year-old South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) official has been arrested for fraud in Volksrust, Mpumalanga. The suspect, who was arrested on Friday, 26 February by the Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation Unit, is expected to appear before the Nelspruit Magistrates Court on Monday. The suspect allegedly submitted a fraudulent matric certificate, that was one of the requirements for employment, in 2006. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the Sassa office was vetted, and the qualifications were tested by the Department of Education. It was then discovered that her matric certificate was fraudulent. “The suspect prejudiced government over R4 million in salary between 2006 and 2020,” she said.
