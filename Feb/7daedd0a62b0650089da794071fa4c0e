MANY izangoma usually consult clients from their indumba. But sangoma Fresh Molambo is easy to find and is always ready to help clients. He is known as the drive through sangoma as he operates from a busy road in Winterveld, north of Tshwane, where he sells imbiza and helps couples with their problems.  The 57-year-old said he’s been a sangoma for 35 years, and working from the road was a good idea. He struggled to get clients when he worked from home, so he tried to sell imbiza from the roadside and the response was positive. He said his customers included cops, taxi and truck drivers, teachers and other motorists. “I don’t only sell imbiza, but I talk to those who want to consult,” he said. Sangoma Fresh said he sold his imbiza in two-litre bottles and said his muthi has helped many people. READ: SLAY QUEEN SANGOMA! “This isn’t only for men. Even women can drink it and it makes magic in the bedroom,” he said. “It also helps men who have a problem with erection and low libido. Women struggling to fall pregnant can also drink it.” One of sangoma Fresh’s customers, Brian Nkabi (56), said: “My wife was cheating on me because I wasn’t that active in bed. “A friend of mine told me about this imbiza and the roadside sangoma. Ever since I knew about it, I’ve never been the same,” he said. Another customer, Cecilia Rankuna (30) had thought she was barren. “I thought I couldn’t have kids, but didn’t want to give up. I tried this muthi and I now have three kids.”
