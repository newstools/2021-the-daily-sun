AMAZULU striker Lehlohonolo Majoro says they will not allow Black Leopards to stain their good run. The two sides will clash in the Nedbank Cup last-16 at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Majoro, who won this competition with Kaizer Chiefs and with Orlando Pirates in 2013 and 2014 respectively wants to see his side continuing where they left it off against Lidoda Duvha. Under Benni McCarthy, Usuthu have won five of their six games in all competitions. They reached this stage of the competition after dumping out their Durban rivals Golden Arrows on penalties. In the last-32, Majoro scored in the referee’s optional time to take the game to extra time. “I believe each and every player needs this momentum going,” said Majoro who has scored six goals in 14 appearances this season. “You can see there’s a good mood in the team since we are on the winning streak. We want to keep that mood and continue to win many games as possible. “Judging by the way we train, judging by the way the guys commit themselves when they come here at training session, I believe that we will go a long way.” Meanwhile, coach Benni McCarthy has though acknowledged a “spark” in Leopards side since Kosta Papic was appointed as the technical advisor. McCarthy said Leopards’ resurgence of form doesn’t bother him because the Nedbank Cup is the difference “beast” altogether. “You can see it is players who are playing under a new management and it was a good win for them,” said McCarthy. “But I think Nedbank Cup is a different beast. We just want to go out there and be organised and be disciplined and give the best that we can possibly get.”
