SPOKESMAN, confidante and strong supporter of former eThekwini Municipality mayor Zandile Gumede has died after a short illness. Mzomuhle Dube (46) was rushed to the King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban on Thursday morning after complaining of fatigue. But he died in the evening shortly after being admitted to a ward for critical patients. ANC councillor Ntando Khuzwayo told Daily Sun that Dube was a known ANC activist as he spent his youth in the fight for the liberation of our people. He added that he was one of the comrades who survived the apartheid-sponsored violence that resulted in the bloodbath between the IFP and ANC. “After he survived several attempts on his life, comrade Dube left with his family to establish a new home in the Umkhobosa area outside Esikhaleni.” Khuzwayo described Dube as a kind, wise figure in the ANC. “We are facing very tough times in the party, and he was a leading figure for many of us. He showed great wisdom and was always smiling. He never lost his temper; he was always the voice of reason, and never afraid of expressing his feelings. He was always respectful,” said Khuzwayo, adding that Gumede was deeply saddened by his death. “She is distraught. Dube’s death has hit her hard. She sent us to the family to convey her message of support and condolences,” he said. Dube’s death follows one of another Gumede supporter Sduduzo Magwaza, who was gunned down at his Cornubia home in January. Magwaza and Dube did not only support Gumede during her court case, but their relationship dated back to when she was wrestling for position of eThekwini ANC regional chairperson against James Nxumalo. Details of the funeral will be made public in due course.
