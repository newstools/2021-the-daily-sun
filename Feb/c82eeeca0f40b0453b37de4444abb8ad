SINIKIWE Maombedze (29) and Sam Mawire (34) are living proof that love conquers all. The couple, who’re living with the same disabilities, brought love to their community when they got married last year. Soon they were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. But the couple from Lusaka in Mamelodi, Tshwane, who can neither speak nor hear, have been trying to find easier ways to raise their baby. They said although their aunt, Gladys Chakadenga (63), is living with them, they felt they need to learn how to take care of their baby themselves. Speaking to Daily Sun through the aunt, Sinikiwe said their baby Stella has brought so much joy to their lives but they can’t help worrying how they’ll take care of her. “Our child can hear, but how will we be able to teach her to talk when we can’t?” said Sinikiwe. She said through songs they signal to Stella and she responds.  “My aunt has been living with us since 2019, but she has her own family. She’ll soon have to go home and we really need to be independent,” she said. Sam was excited to be a father and believed the child will teach them a lot. He said the only difficult thing he was facing as a father was the struggle of providing for his family. “I’m not working or receiving a grant. I need to get a job so I can raise my child properly. I don’t want to see her suffer because I can’t provide for her,” he said. Gladys said the new parents shouldn’t worry about their child because she’s not going anywhere anytime soon. She said since the baby arrived the parents had been doing a good job and she knows they’ll continue doing that. “We hope they keep making babies so their family grows,” she said.
