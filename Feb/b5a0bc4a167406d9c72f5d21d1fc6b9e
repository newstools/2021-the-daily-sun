DEMOCRATIC Alliance leader John Steenhuisen said the State
of the  Nation Address (SONA) by
President Cyril Ramaphosa has failed to 
inspire confidence to Mzansi. He said some of the things that Ramaphosa said during the
address are impossible. “He used beautiful words and soothing tones to offer
empty promises and impractical plans. He is not steering the ship to calmer
waters. It is not even clear he is at the helm. Three crises are  crippling South Africa: the Covid crisis, the
economic crisis, and our crisis of democracy” said Steenhuisen. The DA said Mzansi expected to hear solutions that are
plaguing the  country but the President
failed to deliver. “Tonight, we needed to hear about real progress on real
solutions to  our real challenges. We
needed to hear the practical steps that are 
being taken to roll out vaccines, get our economy growing, and
restore  the political accountability
that is essential in a democracy,” added 
Steenhuisen. The DA leader said Ramaphosa promised to deal with
corruption the year that he got in power but nothing was done. He said no high
profile  politician has been convicted
since Ramaphosa took office despite the 
fact that he was going to deal with corruption. “And in fact, many of the worst offenders such as David
Mahlobo and  Gwede Mantashe are still in
his cabinet,” added. United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa took
to Twitter to express his feeling about Ramaphosa’s speech. “Promises as usual. What happened to other promises of the
last two years such as Mzimvubu  Dam
Project? He spoke as if it is normal yet tomorrow his govt Covid regulations
will speak against his promises especially job creation &  economic growth” said Holomisa. #SONA2021 Promises as usual. What happened to other promises of the last two years such as Mzimvubu Dam Project? He spoke as if it is normal yet tomorrow his govt Covid regulations will speak against his promises esp job creation & economic growth.
