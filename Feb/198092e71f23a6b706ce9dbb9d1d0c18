A SECOND person opened a sexual assault case against a supervisor from a security company contracted by the University of Fort Hare. This emerged when the supervisor appeared in the East London Magistrates Court yesterday for a bail application in another rape case. He’s accused of raping a colleague on 2 July last year as a form of punishment. The investigating officer, Nopasika Mbuli, told the court the accused also had a pending sexual offence case at the Mdantsane Magistrates Court. It also emerged there was no DNA evidence linking him to the crime. Giving evidence, Mbuli said the victim was on duty when a student asked her to pick up a laptop in her room. She did, but her supervisor was not happy, threatened to dock her salary and said she might be fired. “She asked for forgiveness. The complainant said the accused asked her to open one of the rooms and asked her if she was on contraceptives,” she said. Mbuli said the sexual intercourse was to pay for handing over the laptop. “He asked her to undress and sleep with him if she doesn’t want to be fired.” She did it as she was afraid of getting fired. Mbuli said the supervisor slept with her the following day as well. “He said he will decide when the punishment is over,” she said. Mbuli said she opposed bail because of the seriousness of the case and the suspect might interfere with witnesses. But the accused’s legal representative, Ntsikelelo Manyisane, said he was not a flight risk. Manyisane asked Mbuli why it took about five months for the victim to report the matter. Mbuli said she was afraid of losing her job. The case was postponed to Friday.
