ACCORDING to street lingo, “bigger is better”. The quantifying of things has become synonymous to how we view and value things in life. Anything that is big is deemed to be important and special. Take the human belly, AKA umkhaba, for instance. While it is unhealthy to have one, according to recent trends, more women love a man with a huge belly. Researchers at Erciyes University in Kayseri, Turkey, have just completed a year-long study that looked at the correlation between body mass index and male sexual performance. Their findings revealed that overweight men with bellies lasted five minutes longer than their thinner brethren. Researchers also revealed that men with higher BMI (umkhaba) lasted an average of 7,3 minutes in bed while the slimmer groups suffered from premature ejaculation and barely lasted for two minutes. According to scientists, more belly fat means a man has more estradiol, a female sex hormone that helps to inhibit orgasm. Simply put, the SUV offers a longer joyful ride.
