PITSO Mosimane will be hoping to bounce back quickly from his first ever defeat at the helm of Egyptian giants Al Ahly. Mosimane saw his 23 match unbeaten record as The Red Eagles’ coach come to an end following a 2-0 loss to European champions Bayern Munich in the Fifa Club World semi-final on Monday. Robert Lewandowski netted twice for the Bundesliga outfit as Mosimane tasted his first defeat since joining Al Ahly from Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns. Mosimane was not too disheartened by the defeat, however, as he believes his side gave the Bavarian giants a run for their money. But he will be looking to turn the page as soon as possible and get back on the winning trail. They face Brazilian outfit Palmeiras in the third place playoff tomorrow (5pm) at Education City Stadium in Ar-Rayyan, Qatar. “It’s my first time since I’ve been at Al Ahly in about five months that I’ve now suffered my first defeat,” said Mosimane after the match. “It’s my first defeat in five months so you’ve got to understand how I feel and I hate losing. “It was a very difficult game for us. They are a very good team and you can understand why they’re the number one team in the world. “I don’t think we were that bad and we were defensively organised. We just lacked a little bit of the quality that they have to create or score goals.” Mosimane will now hope to finish the tournament on a high with victory over Copa Libertadores champions Palmeiras, which would see Ahly claim the bronze medal. The African Club of the Century have previously finished third in this competition in 2006 and Mosimane will be determined to repeat that feat. “We will have to improve on many aspects,” added Mosimane. “Football at World Cup level will always show you that you still have a lot of work to do. We are now looking forward to achieving third place against Palmeiras. “We will work hard and fight to achieve that.”
