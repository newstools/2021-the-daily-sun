KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt described the shock Nedbank Cup loss to Richards Bay embarrassing and the worst of his 27-year coaching career. But history reveals other astonishing defeats suffered at the hands of minnows, the 2019 Nedbank Cup loss to TS Galaxy top of the pile. KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA picks four of the worst in recent memory. 1. University of Pretoria were a second-tier side when they reached the 2009 Nedbank Cup final. They caused one of the biggest upsets en route to the final when they edged mighty Amakhosi 4-3 in the last 16 round. 2. Baroka were an unknown entity until they claimed major scalps, including that of Chiefs in the 2011 cup edition. The then second division side beat Amakhosi 2-1 in the quarterfinals. 3. As far as humiliating cup defeats go, the 1-0 loss in the final of the 2019 Nedbank Cup at the hands of then first division outfit TS Galaxy ranks higher in the list. 4. The cup specialists are still reeling from the 2-1 suffered at the hands of Richards Bay on Sunday. The early last 16 round exit following a string of poor results by Amakhosi, who can't rise above mediocrity.
