HE was busy with his plumbing job while his five-roomed house was being ransacked on Thursday, 11 February. But Elliot Moyo’s home wasn’t broken into by thugs, but allegedly by cops. He said he was relieved when he found out it was the police, but his relief was short-lived when he realised his money and other belongings were missing. The 46-year-old from Durban Deep in Roodepoort, Joburg, said he had more than R7 000 in his house when the cops allegedly vandalised it. He said cops told him they were looking for zama zamas. “But this doesn’t answer who took my money when they searched my house.  “I don’t know why police would think zama zamas would live in my house and why they broke in without calling me,” he said. Elliot said he also lost plumbing tools and his two doors were damaged. He said a tin with R1 000 worth of coins and the spare key of his Nissan Almera were missing. “But cops said they didn’t see the missing money, tools or car keys,” he said. “I’m angry with the cops as the woman who lives with me said they ordered her not to call me. I found a garden fork in my room, which I suspect they used to break in.” Elliot said he’s been to the Roodepoort cop shop twice to report the missing money and tools, but was allegedly sent from pillar to post. Danai Dokwane (62), who lives with Elliot, alleged the cops broke the door when they went into the house. “They took the tools and didn’t allow me to go outside to call Elliot,” she said. Gauteng police spokesman Kay Makhubele said he has sent the case number to the relevant cop shop and will respond as soon as they revert back to him.
