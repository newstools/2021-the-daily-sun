Outside his home, there is an army of MK personnel, stationed there to protect him from being arrested for defying the Constitutional Court. In a video doing the rounds on various social media platforms, Myeni can be heard saying that with her family, they decided to make food donations to Zuma as he continued to host people at his home. “As a pensioner with no shares in many mining companies, that we know very well from the sufferings of the Zuma Foundation, I said let me come and give the little that we can afford with my family to say: ‘please continue during your pension years that God has given you to enjoy with your people’.”
