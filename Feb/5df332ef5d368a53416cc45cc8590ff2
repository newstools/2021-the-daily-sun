A group of men believed to be from a gang stormed one of the luxury car dealers in Cape Town and allegedly demanded two of the cars. But when the staff refused, all hell broke loose as they went on a damaging spree causing expensive damage to the luxury cars at The Toy Shop in Woodbridge Island, Milnerton in Cape Town.  In a video that surfaced on social media, the men are seen damaging the cars, breaking the window of some of the expensive cars money can buy. Some of those that were damaged include supercars such as Mclaren, Austin Martin, Ferrari, Jaguar, Lotus and the Porsche Cayenne SUV. It is also alleged that the gang members, who apparently disembarked from two filled-to-capacity minibus taxis also vandalised the premises and assaulted some of the staff members before they fled the scene. The cost of the damage made at the luxury dealer is still unknown at the moments. 2 taxis pulled up at The Toy Shop (luxury car shop) A few guys got out and demanded they give them 2 cars. Needless to say they told them to fuck off. 40 guys got out and fucked up every car in the showroom. Also beat up some of the staff. Crazy fucking times in Cape Town. pic.twitter.com/amDs2r6BKy More information to follow.
