The department encouraged pupils to visit their website to check their results and also go to their schools to get their statement of results.

Registration can be done at either the school or district office in the province (all instructions appear on the reverse side of the statement of results),” the department said. The closing date for applications for manual and online applications is 10 March 2021. The fees for remarking is R120 per subject and its R290 for rechecking a subject.
