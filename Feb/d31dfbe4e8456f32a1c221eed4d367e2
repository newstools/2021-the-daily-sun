FORMER Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) assistant coach Lucky “King Muchichwa” Nelukau says he still can’t believe he is no longer part of Vhadau VhaDamani after the new owner, Abraham Sello, fired him. Nelukau has been part of Tshakhuma since 2015 when they were still campaigning in the ABC Motsepe League. But Sello, who bought TTM for R50 million from Masala Mulaudzi two weeks ago, released Nelukau and coach Joel Masutha as he is bringing in his own management and technical team. And former Baroka coach Dylan Kerr is set to replace Masutha. The Englishman is expected to lead the team in their DStv Premiership clash against Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium this afternoon (5pm). “You know we founded this club in 2015 and I have been part of it since,” said Nelukau. “Even when Mulaudzi came I was still part of it. I have been with this club (Tshakhuma) from the amateur league, GladAfrica Championship and Premiership. This team was like a second home to me. I still cannot believe I am no longer with them. It’s tough to take it but in life, you have to move on. When one door closes, another opens. “I love Tshakhuma so much and I was hoping to be part of the team when we started to achieve things. I am sad, but this is football and I understand.” Last season when Tshakhuma was still in the Championship, Nelukau was appointed interim coach after the club sacked Vladislav Heric when Vhadau VhaDamani was in the middle of the table. He helped the Venda-based outfit qualify for the promotional play-offs. Asked about his next move, Nelukau, who is well known in Venda football circles, told SunSport: “I am still relaxing at home with my family. But one thing for sure is that I will be back in football soon.”
