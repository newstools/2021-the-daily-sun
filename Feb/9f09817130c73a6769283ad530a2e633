TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) head coach Joel Masutha believes their big win against SuperSport United could be a turning point for them. TTM claimed a 1-0 win over SuperSport United in the Nedbank Cup last-32 match at the Thohoyandou Stadium in Limpopo on Thursday evening. The victory saw Vhadau Vha Damani advance to the last 16 of the South African FA Cup, while a much-fancied Matsatsantsa side bowed out in the first round of the tournament for the second season in a row. Former SuperSport player, Thabo Mnyamane scored the only goal of the match that separated the two sides. This was TTM’s second win in all competitions since the beginning of the season. And now they are aiming at building in it going forward according to their coach Joel Masutha. “Very tough game against formidable opponents cup specialist SuperSport United,” Masutha said. “It’s never easy when you play them they have already beaten us twice, we just said today it has to be our game. “The players brought their A-game, they put in a good shift. This will bring about self-belief, confidence. They need to believe start that we are like any other teams we can win games. This win will bring self-belief, it is the start of many wins to come because we have to move, climb the log.” The Venda outfit will now have a week before their next game where they visit Maritzburg United in a relegation dogfight at Harry Gwala Stadium in a DStv Premiership match next Friday (5pm). They will be hoping for a second league win which will move them away from position 15 which they are currently occupying in the log.After 15 games, TTM have managed to gather only nine points, same as Black Leopards who are languishing at the bottom of the table and Maritzburg United who are in position 14. The three teams are only separated by positive goal difference.
