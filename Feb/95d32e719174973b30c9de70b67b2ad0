A South
African Airways (SAA) flight, scheduled to transport the country's next
consignment of Covid-19 vaccines, departed on Wednesday night. The A340
aircraft is expected to return on Saturday, said Louise Brugman, a spokesperson
for Matuson & Associates, which is overseeing the embattled airline's
business rescue. "SAA
has been approached by the government to assist with the transportation of
vaccines," she added. On Tuesday,
Health Minister Zweli Mkhize announced in Parliament that 80 000 doses of the
Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine were expected to arrive in the country
on Saturday. These will be added to the first consignment of 80 000 doses of
the same vaccine, which arrived on 16 February. An SAA
plane, which was supposed to fetch the vaccines for SA in Brussels, Belgium,
was prevented from departing because it was not compliant with civil aviation
regulations at the time, according to Fin24. The J&J
vaccine, used in the Sisonke Programme, provides 57% protection against
moderate to severe disease, 85% protection against severe disease and 100%
protection against death, based on evidence from clinical trials that included
South African participants. However,
new research has indicated that the protection rate may be higher. As of
Wednesday, the total number of healthcare workers vaccinated under the Sisonke
Programme was 41 809. SOURCE:
