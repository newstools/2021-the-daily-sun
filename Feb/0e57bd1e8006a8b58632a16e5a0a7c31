 FOR the seventh straight game, Percy Tau watched from the bench as Brighton Albion & Hove stuttered to get out of the relegation zone in the English Premiership on Saturday.  Brighton missed two penalties as they went down 1-0 to West Brom, a result which triggered a backlash from thousands of kilometres away in Mzansi.  Throngs of Tau’s South African fans are not happy that their superstar is growing butt-blisters sitting on the bench and they have voiced their displeasure in the best way they know how… vent on social media.  “To whom it may concern: You will never win until you field Percy Tau,” tweeted @Monye  He was alone in the condemnation with @NtateSam tweeting: “Kindly note Percy Tau has never missed a penalty in his life”  “No Percy Tau + no win. Simple as that,” said @CFCChris3 #BHACRYPercy Tau went frm playing in da Champions league to actually playing for Tshakhuma Tshama Brighton Albion pic.twitter.com/MaZGqL5cll To whom it may concern: You will never win until you field Percy Tau pic.twitter.com/6VBKlnZ3kD  No Percy tau, no win for Brighton pic.twitter.com/8KhJFE0WfX Percy Tau left Anderlecht FC where he was truly appreciated and got some game time then moved to Brighton Hove a club that's smelling relegation and still struggling to get atleast 6 points.
