NOT so long ago, Ngizwe Mchunu insulted maskandi artists on Facebook. It appears the former Ukhozi FM and Roots presenter is at it again. This time, he insulted top gospel artists Thinah Zungu, Jumbo Nyangiwe, Dumi Mkokstad, Ayanda Ntanzi and Malusi Mbokazi. Taking to Facebook on Monday, 22 February, he told the artists they were tomatoes and would not reach the late Sfiso Ncwane’s level in gospel music. “Thinah and Jumbo are not musicians; they’re just ushers and tomatoes. The only male gospel musician was Sfiso. He defeated them while he was alive, and still does when he is no more,” he said. READ: COPS HUNT ZINHLE'S HUSBAND! Ngizwe told Daily Sun people should know that he’s a straight talker. “Sfiso is the only gospel singer who won SAMA Song of the Year. These tomato artists are far from his throne. Dumi only became popular when he got married, not for his music. Ayanda and Malusi don’t have good voices to sing gospel,” he said. Ngizwe said Thinah was not fit to sing gospel. “I will ask people to search for the new best artist to be crowned as gospel music king,” he said. Last year, Ngizwe insulted his former colleague Tshatha Ngobe, saying he knew nothing about radio and maskandi. Thinah told Daily Sun he heard what Ngizwe said. “I didn’t like it when he called my double-storey house a four room on top of another. He must not mention my house. Ngizwe, let us please respect each other,” he pleaded. ALSO READ: LASIZWE'S RELATIONSHIP ENDS IN TEARS! Jumbo urged Ngizwe not to start a fight. “Do I really look like a tomato? I don’t know what I did to Ngizwe,” he said. Dumi confirmed he saw Ngizwe’s comments, but declined to comment. Malusi said he was shocked. “But I’m happy that when he mentioned top gospel artists, he mentioned me even though I only have one hit song. This shows my hit is timeless.”
