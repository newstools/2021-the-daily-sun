SUPERSPORT United maintained their five-game unbeaten record against Kaizer Chiefs with a 1-1 league draw at FNB Stadium on Saturday. On the other hand, Chiefs avoided a fourth successive defeat, even though they would have left the Calabash feeling they dropped two points. Goals from Reeve Frosler and Bradley Grobler ensured the two sides share the spoils in the DStv Premiership fixture. Frosler thundered in the opener in the first half with a sweet strike outside the box. But Grobler netted his 13 goals of the season when he sent Itumeleng Khune the wrong way with a cool finish from the penalty spot midway through the second half.
