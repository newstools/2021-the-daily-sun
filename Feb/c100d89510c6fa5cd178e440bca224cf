WHEN they painted their bodies with muthi, they thought they’d be invincible – but they were wrong. The muthi, carried in a bucket in the car, didn’t protect them at all as three of them died in a shoot-out with cops yesterday, in Josiah Gumede Road in Pinetown, KZN. Another suspect and a cop were wounded while two suspects fled the scene on foot. According to a police source, a security guard saw a group of six men moisturising themselves with liquid from a white bucket. “The guard wasn’t sure what they were doing but cops stormed the area and the suspects panicked and raced off,” said the source. He said the suspects were shooting at the police who returned fire. He said the suspects lost control of their car and crashed into a garage on the same road. KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said cops from the provincial K9 Unit were following up on intelligence about a white Ford Ranger that was involved in a spate of armed robberies in the greater Durban area. “They spotted the car and attempted to pull it over, but the suspects tried to flee while shooting at the police,” said Naicker. He said six suspects got out of the car and shot at the police and officers from a security company. “Two suspects managed to flee the scene and a manhunt is still continuing.” He said four firearms were seized from the crime scene and confirmed that police found traditional medicine in the car as well as a two-way radio and other items used to commit robberies. “Police in Pinetown are investigating cases of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition as well as an inquest. “Detectives are convinced that this gang will be linked to a number of recent robberies in the greater Durban area,” Naicker said. Acting provincial commissioner, Major-General Thulani Gonya, said the thugs believed the muthi made them untouchable. “This highlights the dedication of police to bring criminals to book. We wish the injured officer a speedy recovery,” he said.
