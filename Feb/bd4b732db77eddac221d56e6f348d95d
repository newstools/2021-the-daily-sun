THE uMkhonto weSizwe military veterans top leadership is expected to visit former president Jacob Zuma’s homestead in Nkandla, northern KZN, on Thursday, 11 February. Coincidentally, former late president Nelson Mandela was set free on 11 February 1990. The veterans’ president, Kebby Maphatsoe, said the visit was set long before EFF leader Julius Malema made his public request to visit “uBaba”. “Our visit was set during our National Executive Council sitting at the beginning of January,” he said. “We just didn’t see the need to make a public announcement.” He said several issues would be discussed with Zuma. “Among the issues is that we want to reassure Zuma we’re fully behind him as he’s being constantly attacked by the Zondo Commission,” he said. He said they were going to support him until the bitter end. They’d realised the commission had taken the decision to paint him as guilty. “They want to paint him as the face of corruption,” said Maphatsoe. Zuma had always been a law-abiding citizen, but the continuous attacks had pushed him into behaving in the manner he now behaved. “If Zuma is being ill-treated by the South African justice system, where is he supposed to go?” he asked. “That’s why he ended up saying, ‘Let it be. I’m not afraid of jail’,” said Maphatsoe. He said people needed to know Zuma had a strong support base. “And we don’t know how they’re going to react if he’s being constantly attacked, as if he’s never fought for this country. We, too, will not stop supporting him and standing behind him,” he said.
