SHAKES Ngema of kwaito duo Shakes no Singil has finally found a music genre that suits him. He has been doing kwaito with his younger brother Singil since 2013, but he’s spreading his wings and has gone solo. Shakes released an Afro pop debut single song titled Siyakhuleka. It aims to fight gender-based violence. He said he realised that even men faced abuse but didn’t have a platform to address it as women do. “Gender-based violence is bad for all people and my song is also a prayer to God to help us win against it.” ALSO READ: IDOLS SA HOST GOES BACK TO SCHOOL! Shakes from Empangeni, KZN, told SunBuzz he’s found a producer who understands his voice. “Many producers used to say my voice is good for kwaito and limited me from doing other genres. I knew my voice is versatile and I wanted to do Afro pop because I love it. “It allows me to convey the serious message well. Last year I met producer Sibongiseni ‘Siba Music’ Langa, who is good at what he does. “I started working with him this year and everything went well. We managed to record three songs in three days,” he said. Shakes is now working on his album. He said from now he’ll only sing kwaito with his brother. Last year they released their single, Khona Into Engbambile, featuring Danger of Big Nuz.
