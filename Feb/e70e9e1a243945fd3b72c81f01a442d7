RESIDENTS were left in shock after a burnt body was found with handcuffs on. Scrap collectors in the Eastbury area of Phoenix, north of Durban, made the discovery on Wednesday. It wasn’t clear when the body was burnt and no one had any idea who could be responsible. A resident who lives close to the scene said she was at home when she saw a group of people standing next to a bushy area. “I was shocked when I heard the news because we never heard anyone crying out for help. We didn’t even see anything burning,” said the resident. ALSO READ: ZINHLE MABENA’S HUSBAND, ROBERT NGWENYA SPEAKS!

Whoever burnt the body probably thought no one would find it,” said the resident. ALSO READ: PICS: MASHONISA MOERED!
