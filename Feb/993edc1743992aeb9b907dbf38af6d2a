DON’T increase personal taxes – rather reduce them as well as public spending. This was some advice offered to Finance Minister Tito Mboweni ahead of his budget address to Parliament on Wednesday, 24 February. Mboweni is facing a hard task after the economic battering due to Covid-19 and lockdown. With the country having lost billions, Mboweni has warned his department could move to a zero-based budget, meaning every cent spent by other departments would have to be justified. The DA warned that the country’s debt was too high, a point raised by Mboweni himself when he tabled his medium-term budget.

DA shadow finance minister Geordin Hill-Lewis accused Mboweni of speaking like a spectator. “Growth is the only way to pull SA out of the fiscal crisis it faces, without having to effect deep and painful spending cuts across the state. Absent faster economic growth, government will be forced to choose which services can remain and which will have to be cut,” he said.
