RESIDENTS of Kraaifontein in Cape Town, Western Cape, said they had heard enough gunshots and shootings on their streets this week. This after an alleged 27s gang boss William “Red” Steven was murdered at his residence on Tuesday, 2 February. “I don’t feel comfortable to go to the shops because a shoot-out can start from anywhere. Our kasi has been like a war zone this week,” said resident Thembelani Mbuqe (47) from Scottsville. Another resident Rashida Parker (30) said she feared kids would be caught in the crossfire. “They have been shooting on the streets this week and our kids are not safe. They may find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time because of gang wars. Those affiliated to the murdered boss will retaliate, and the wars will be bloody,” she said. Steven and two other gang members Mark Lifman and Jerome “Donkie” Booysen were recently bust. They appeared in court in December in connection with the murder of Brian Wainstein. The MEC of Community Safety Albert Fritz called for calm.  “I call for calm in Kraaifontein, and particularly Scottsville. Upon hearing of Steven’s death, my department immediately contacted the SAPS provincial joints committee to understand their response to maintain calm in the area. We cannot allow our communities to become places of instability or violence,” said Fritz. He urged the public to help cops with information regarding the murder. Earlier this week, police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said: “The circumstances surrounding the death of a 56-year-old man are being investigated after he was shot and killed at his residence in Rembrandt Street, Kraaifontein. Three unknown suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested.” He urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111. During his visit in Cape Town, Minister of Police Bheki Cele said cops would monitor the situation in Kraaifontein, adding that the army would be brought in, if needed.
