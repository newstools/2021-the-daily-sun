THE Hawks in Limpopo today arrested a woman following a failed alleged plot to kill her ex-husband. The 35-year-old ex-wife from Thohoyandou, Limpopo, allegedly hired a hitman for R10 000 to execute her ex over child maintenance dispute. Limpopo Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said when they received a tip-off about the plot, they kept an observation until the suspect went to withdraw the money to pay the hitman. They then arrested her. “The suspect allegedly started talking to the hitman last November, and they reached a deal when she promised to pay R10 000 to execute her ex-husband,” Maluleke said. The suspect is expected to appear before the Thohoyandou Magistrates Court on Friday, 25 February for conspiracy to commit murder.
