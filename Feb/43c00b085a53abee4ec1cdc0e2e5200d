WHEN Mandla Mobi was knocked down by a bakkie belonging to a known mashonisa on Saturday, 13 February, his family was convinced he was hit on purpose. On Monday, 15 February after Mandla was buried, residents of Mhinga Village, outside Giyani in Limpopo, cornered the mashonisa, who allegedly told them Mandla was killed as part of a ritual killing. A resident told Daily Sun: “The people went on a rampage and attacked the mashonisa. They beat him to a pulp along with his driver. The angry residents went as far as setting his car and house alight, and also damaged his chicken coops.”  Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a businessman and his employee were admitted to hospital. He said cases of public violence, attempted murder, malicious damage to property, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and arson were opened. “The suspects involved are still unknown and there have been no arrests. A manhunt has been launched and a dedicated team of detectives are requesting anyone with information that could lead to arrests to come forward,” said Ngoepe. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba said disrespect of the law will not be condoned. He urged the public not to commit crimes and not to take the law into their own hands. Ledwaba said all criminal activities should be reported to the police. “Those who are still perpetrating these types of incidents will be dealt with harshly,” he said.
