A 
Pretoria couple who raped their two minor children and forced them to 
perform sexual acts on each other has been sentenced to life in prison. The
 couple – a 39-year-old man and 33-year-old woman who cannot be named to
 protect the identities of the victims – were found guilty of rape, 
compelled rape, sexual assault, sexual grooming, flashing, child neglect
 and possession of drugs. On Friday, the Pretoria North Regional 
Court sentenced each of the accused to two life imprisonment terms and 
an additional 22 years behind bars.    "The
 CPF took them to the police station, where they told the police about 
where their home was. Upon arrival, the police found drugs and the 
couple was arrested for child neglect and possession of drugs." Charges of rape and other sexual offences were added later after the two minors revealed what had happened to them. The parents had pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Prosecutor
 Hanlie du Preez said the couple did not deserve to be parents and it 
was sad that children weren't protected by their parents and weren't 
safe in their own homes.   Du Preez said the minimum prescribed sentences for the offences had to be imposed.
