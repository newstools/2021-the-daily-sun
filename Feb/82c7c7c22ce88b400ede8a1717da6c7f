PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has called out opposition parties for name-calling and mudslinging instead of coming up with workable solutions as the country battled Covid-19. He was responding to the Sona debate after days of MPs coming hard at him for what they described as an address that lacked vision. They accused him of being a weak leader. In his response yesterday, Ramaphosa said all too often politicians found themselves distracted by intrigues of the day and overcome by pressures of the moment to a point they failed to see the potential of the nation. “I’ve spoken this afternoon on some of this country’s strengths and capabilities: how we’ve nurtured them, and how we continue to develop them because all too often we overlook them,” he said. Ramaphosa said in their debates several MPs noted the nation had to pull together with greater urgency and at great scale to address challenges. He said that was why his address focused on progress and promises. He reminded MPs their job was to engage, not insult one another. “We share the same fears and anxieties about our future. We share the same hopes and desires. I spoke about the qualities we share and common purpose that binds us together. ALSO READ: PICS:
