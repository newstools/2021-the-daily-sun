A 27-year-old Limpopo woman has been arrested for the murder of her boyfriend. The couple that lives on a farm in the Ebenezer area outside Tzaneen had a heated argument on Saturday morning. Police spokesman, Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the couple were inside the room on the farm when they started to have an argument and unexpectedly, the suspect allegedly produced a sharp object and stabbed him. "Afterwards, the victim managed to go out of the room and screamed for help when he fell on the ground and succumbed to his injuries." "The local community heard someone screaming and came out of their houses and found the deceased lying in a pool of blood. Subsequently, the suspect was overpowered by one of the community members and the instrument used for the murder was also confiscated," Ngoepe said. Ngoepe condemned the incident with the strongest terms and advised residents, mostly couples, to consult their local professionals in case of any social-related problem rather than resorting to violence. The woman was immediately arrested after the Medical Emergency team certified the victim dead at the scene. She will appear in the Tzaneen Magistrate Court on Monday for murder, while the police investigations are still underway.
