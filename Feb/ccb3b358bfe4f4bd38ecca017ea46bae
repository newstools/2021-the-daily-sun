Mamelodi Sundowns joint coach Steve Komphela has admitted that striker Peter Shalulile’s celebration does worry them. The star forward recently showcased another one of his unique celebrations after scoring against Baroka FC. The former Highlands Park marksman tossed his body over a perimeter board in a manner that sent a bit of concern to some supporter. Downs fans are worried that the Namibian could injure himself as he celebrates a goal one day and this would not be ideal. They took to Twitter to plead with the Downs coaches to speak to Shalulile and ask him to tone down his celebration. Komphela admitted that they have had a conversation with the striker regarding his celebration. “We do talk to him, he’ll tell you “ I’m a tyre, I just roll,” replied Komphela. “On a more serious note, he’s very careful and conscious about it. He just gives you a contagious laugh and promise not to. “What a human being, what a soul!” We are blessed to have him.”
