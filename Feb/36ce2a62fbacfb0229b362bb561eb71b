FAMILY members of two people who drowned in the Tugela River last week Friday have not lost hope of finding their bodies. This comes despite a warning from search and rescue members that they spotted crocodiles at the spot in uMlalazi, northern KZN. Madala Hlomisimpi Magwaza (52) and his grandson Lwandle (8) drowned after going to the river with other residents to clear it. Lwandle’s mum and Hlomsimpi’s daughter, Slindile, told Daily Sun: “The river had trees that made it difficult for residents to cross the overflowing bridge, so residents decided it was a good idea to remove the trees.” She said Lwandle tagged along because he followed his grandfather everywhere he went.  “From what I heard, Lwandle was trying to get water in a bucket when he started experiencing difficulties,” she said. “My dad tried to help him but drowned as well. “As painful and scary as it is, we’re still hopeful they will be found.” Councillor Nkosikhona Nkala said it was the second drowning incident in just a week. “Another man drowned about a week ago,” said Nkala. “His body has not been recovered yet.” KwaZulu-Natal cop spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. “It was reported that while residents were removing rubbish left by flood water on the bridge, the young boy fell into the river and drowned,” she said. “His grandfather dived into the river to rescue him but got into trouble and drowned. “A search was conducted, which was hampered by flood water and crocodiles. The search will continue.”
