A FORMER pupil from Kgaola High School in Kgautswane Village, outside Burgersfort in Limpopo, recently donated sanitary towels to grade 12 pupils. Osilas Mosoma (45), who’s now a qualified teacher, said he motivated pupils not to drop out of school. “I’m restoring their dignity, confidence and self-esteem,” he said. “I want these kids to defy all odds. “Education remains a societal responsibility and it takes the entire community to raise a child, hence my contribution and visit to the school. “Pupils must desist from substance consumption, sexual relations and loitering in the streets.” Pupils in lower grades also received sanitary pads and stationery. Representative Council of Learners member Sibongiseni Mosoma toldDaily Sun: “We’re humbled by Mosoma’s visit. “On behalf the pupils, I’d like to say we appreciate the contribution.”
