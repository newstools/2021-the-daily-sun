COPS bust a scrapyard owner found in possession of stolen copper sheets worth R4 million, which were scattered at his premises. Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate said the arrest followed a raid conducted at the scrapyard in De Deur in the Vaal late Saturday afternoon, 13 February. He said a middle-aged man was arrested. “Police conducted an intelligence-driven operation at Emma & Sons Scrap Metal Dealer and Recycling behind a shopping complex in De Deur. This was after receiving information of the copper plates that were acquired during an armed robbery at Boksburg earlier this month.” He said on arrival, some men who were found busy at the scrapyard fled, but they managed to arrest one person. “Police found sheets scattered all over the yard. When questioned, the man could not explain or give satisfactory explanations on how the copper plates ended up in the yard.” Upon further police investigations, it was detected that the copper sheets were acquired through a business robbery in Boksburg. “The copper was identified by the owner, and it is estimated at R4 million.” Sedibeng District Commissioner Major General Zodwa Ettie Molefe congratulated and appreciated the effective and efficient sector policing as well as good cops and community partnership in fighting crime. The arrested suspect will appear at the Vereeniging Magistrates Court soon. Tshilate said the suspect was facing charges of possession of stolen properties, and he may be linked to the robbery in Boksburg.
