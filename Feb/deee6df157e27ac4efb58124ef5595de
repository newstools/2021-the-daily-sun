After President Cyril Ramaphosa eased restrictions on the selling of booze, many South Africans rushed to the bottle stores to buy their much loved beverages. So, the following question then dawned on me: what kind of alcohol do South Africans consume and love the most? According to recent statistics, we are among the world’s leading countries in terms of alcohol consumption. In Africa alone, we are in the top five of alcohol consumed per litre. So, what do we love drinking? According to Business Tech magazine, South Africa is a beer-drinking nation taking up 56% of all alcohol consumed. This is followed by wine and spirits with an equal 18% share. The other 8% is shared between ciders and other forms of alcohol. According to Proudly South Africa, beer and boerewors go hand in hand. So it’s not surprising that beer is considered to be South Africa’s unofficial national drink, especially during the sporting season. While we have popular local beers produced by South African Breweries, smaller local and more niche breweries are becoming more popular.
