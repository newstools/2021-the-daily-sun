SUPERSPORT United midfielder Sipho Mbule is working towards achieving his long term dream of playing in the Spanish La Liga one day. Mbule’s consistency has been key for Matsatsantsa a Pitori in a bid to make history by becoming the first team to lift the inaugural DStv Premiership. Said Mbule: “It’s every player’s wish to play overseas. I would like to play in Spain because they play nice football that suits my style. “I also want to play for Bafana Bafana at the highest level like the World Cup.” Mbule has worked hard to convince coach Kaitano Tembo to include him regularly in his starting line-up, but the soft spoken player insists that his best is yet to come. He went on: “I am getting used to the game now and it gets better with game time. The more I do things on the pitch improves other aspects of my game. “But my best has yet to come because there’s room for improvement.” The Bethlehem-born player reckons his side has enough depth to sustain pressure when it gets tough towards the end of the Premiership season. “We don’t have a lot of experienced players like other teams, but we have youngsters who can come in at any given day and do the job. If we play the way we do, take one game at a time and focus on ourselves instead of worrying about what other teams, we can compete (for the title). The 22-year-old player said they are working on rectifying mistakes that saw them drop two crucial points in their 1-1 draw against Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs over the weekend.
