IN January, Mpumalanga premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane was caught on camera not wearing a mask at the funeral of late minister Jackson Mthembu. Fast forward to a month later, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule is appearing in court and one of his many supporters, who came in their numbers, can be seen disembarking from a bus. READ: HOSPITAL BROKE MY 4-5! A woman wearing a white cap and an ANC T-shirt, without a mask, is about to be interviewed on camera. But the reporter tells her that he won’t go ahead with the interview because she is not wearing a mask. In the eNCA video, she can be heard saying she’s from Mpumalanga instead of going back to the bus to take her mask. In the background, she is seen taking another supporter’s mask and wearing it. The World Health Organisation advises that cloth masks be washed, and the disposable ones be thrown away after use. Furthermore, clean your hands before wearing your mask as well as before and after taking it off, and after touching it at any time. Make sure that it covers both your nose and mouth. When you remove it, store it in a clean plastic bag and wash it daily if it’s fabric or dispose of it in a bin if it’s a surgical one. Don’t use masks with valves. #AceMagashule this lady just took someone's mask. ?? This Country.Bloemfontein. pic.twitter.com/qmOn25YBHg
