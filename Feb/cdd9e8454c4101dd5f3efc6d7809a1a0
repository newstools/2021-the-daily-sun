MZANSI wants Savanna drinkers to take it easy. People fear that alcohol might be banned again because of things they do when they drink their favourite beverage. Some make masks, bras, shoes, hats using the packaging of Savanna. Even though they’re doing it out of fun, some people think it’s crazy and should stop. “I’m sure Savanna has a special ingredient because the pictures circulating on social media are very weird. How can an old person do such things,” said Letswalo Morena. He also suggested that they dilute it to avoid misbehaving when they start getting drunk. Lebogang Tsatsi said Savanna drinkers need to be monitored when drinking. She said she’s tired of the booze ban because of reckless behaviour. “I just wish their friends would stop them from doing anything stupid while drinking. This is unacceptable,” said Lebogang. Sylvia Mahlangu said Savanna drinkers need to talk to their ancestors before they start drinking. She believes that their ancestors will help them maintain their “cool” when they start getting drunk.

Ancestors need booze too and Savanna drinkers work overtime to risk the ban of alcohol,” said Sylvia. Daily Sun spoke to some Savanna drinkers who said they’re just having fun and that people should leave them alone. “I don’t understand why people love attacking us so much. It’s not like we’re going around robbing or killing people. We’re just having fun,” said Buhle Ngwenya. Nonhlanhla Skhosana said she won’t stop having fun with the Savanna packaging. “People used to wear plastics in their childhood while playing. They were happy and no one told them to stop. Let us have fun without any criticism, please,” said Nonhlanhla.
