YOU are incompetent, incapacitated and the most unreliable human being. This is what EFF leader Julius Malema told President Cyril Ramaphosa during the State of the Nation Address virtual debate today. Malema said when Ramaphosa was elected ANC president, many people, including the EFF, had hoped he would bring some degree of stability in the country. “It has been three years since you took office and we can all say you have not achieved anything that is worth mentioning,” he said. “It’s now evident that the Guptas have been replaced by a very powerful white capitalist capture of the Ruperts, Oppenheimers, Steven Kosheff, the Mennels and all other white people who played a central role in buying the conference of the ruling party in 2017. We want to state categorically that any leader of our country who owes loyalty to settlers and white state capturers is defining himself as an enemy of the people. We will isolate and ultimately defeat all puppets of the white capitalist establishment.” Malema said people’s living conditions were getting worse and while the pandemic made the situation worse, it was still not to blame for Ramaphosa’s general incompetence. DA leader John Steenhuisen said Ramaphosa’s address to the nation in the midst of the pandemic did not inspire confidence. “If we’re to have any chance of digging ourselves out of the deep hole we’re in, we’re going to have to be truthful about the scale of our problems, the mistakes that contributed to putting us in this position and the steps we now need to take to rectify them,” said Steenhuisen. He said in the three years that Ramaphosa has been at the helm, he made the same promises during his addresses and yet the same burning issues were still apparently his top priorities.
