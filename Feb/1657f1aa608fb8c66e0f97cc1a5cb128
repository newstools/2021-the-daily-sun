THE Eastern Cape ANC issued a statement condemning corruption yesterday. Premier Oscar Mabuyane led a virtual special provincial meeting following Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba’s recent arrest by the Hawks. She was charged with fraud and corruption in connection with former president Nelson Mandela’s funeral. ANC spokesman in the Eastern Cape, Gift Ngqondi, said: “The premier outlined the findings and recommendations by the Special Investigation Unit on PPE procurement allegations. “Having consulted all affected individuals, the premier made assurances the matter would be finalised this week.” However, the news meant nothing to residents of KwaZakhele in Port Elizabeth, whose rubbish hasn’t been collected for more than a month. Solomzi Nkosi (53) said: “We’re troubled by the uncollected rubbish on Khalipha Street. “This was caused by an independent contractor, who came to work here in January but failed to take away the rubbish. It stinks.” Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “We’ll investigate the matter and then send a team.”
