A MAN is fighting for his life in hospital after a security guard shot him. The suspect is behind bars for attempted murder. Johannesburg Central spokesman captain Xoli Mbele told Daily Sun that police arrested a 46-year-old security guard for attempted murder at Ellies Industry in Selby. Mbele said the suspect allegedly shot a 36-year-old male supervisor once in his arm with his licensed firearm. “He fired three shots, and the victim was taken to hospital,” said Mbele. Fortunately, police arrested him before he could get away. He said the motive for the shooting was not yet known. “The firearm used in the commission of a crime was confiscated to check if it hadn’t been used to commit other crimes,” said Mbele. He added that an investigation was underway, and that the suspect would appear in court soon.
