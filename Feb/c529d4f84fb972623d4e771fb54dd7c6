FORMER KZN MEC for Agriculture and former ANC KZN Provincial Executive Council member Meshack Radebe is going to be buried on Saturday, 13 February. Radebe’s funeral service will be held in Manqonqo, outside Pietermaritzburg. He died at his home after an illness last Saturday. Radebe was a close ally of former president Jacob Zuma. The week of his death saw messages of condolences from different political parties pouring in. KZN premier Sihle Zikalala said the country had lost an icon and struggle stalwart, describing him as a political peacekeeper and people’s person. He said Radebe played a critical role in stabilising relations between the ANC and IFP in the province. “Comrade Meshack was known for working hard and establishing peace in various areas in KZN, especially around Hammarsdale during the difficult time of violence. We are convinced that all of those who have learnt from his leadership will emulate him and ensure that his legacy lives on.”
