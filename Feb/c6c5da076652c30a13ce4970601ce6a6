SOUTH African Under-23 coach David Notoane is considering calling Bafana Bafana star Percy Tau as one of his three overage players for the delayed Olympic Games in Japan in August. National teams are allowed to call up three overage players for the Games. Last time former Under-23 coach Owen Da Gama included Kaizer Chiefs duo of Erick Mathoho and Itumeleng Khune for the Rio Olympics in 2016. However, Khune’s inclusion didn’t go down well with the fans as the Amakhosi keeper took the place of then Ajax Cape Town goalie Jody February, who played a sterling role in the Caf Youth Championship in Senegal in 2015 helping the team to qualify for the Olympics. February was denied an opportunity to play at the Olympics as Khune featured in all three group stage matches (0-0 against the hosts Brazil, a 1-0 loss to Denmark and a 1-1 draw against Iraq). The SA U-23 side failed to qualify for the knockout stage. Tau is the star attraction when it comes to Mzansi football after he was recalled by English Premier League side Brighton and Hove Albion last month following a loan spell with Belgium giants, Anderlecht. However, Notoane said he will seek the advice from Bafana head coach Molefi Ntseki to find out how busy his Bafana are before he makes a decision. Bafana are set to have a busy year. They will complete in the delayed Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers on 25 March against Ghana at FNB Stadium before finishing their qualifying campaign against Sudan three days later in Khartoum. After the Afcon qualifiers, the 2022 World Cup qualifiers kick off in June. Bafana will play on 1-15 June, 30-31 August, 1-7 September and 4-12 October. With the Olympics starting in August, it means chances look slim for Notoane to get Tau and two other Bafana players to bolster his SA U-23 squad. “It will depend on what happens with Bafana,” added Notoane. “I’ll have to get the recommendation from coach Ntseki. But definitely, we’ll need some Bafana players to help us.”
