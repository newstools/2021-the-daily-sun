POLICE are investigating an inquest case after a woman (47) died in a bus at Main road in front of Wynberg Centre in Cape Town. Golden Arrow spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said an ambulance was called after a woman collapsed, but unfortunately died. Passenger Lulamile Cebiso said she was witnessing something like this for the first time. “I was waiting for my friend when I heard people saying a woman inside a bus was unconscious. I never thought she would die,” said Cebiso. She said people were sick and stressed because of Covid-19. “Don’t judge people just because they woke up and went to work. They are sick and stressed, and need help,” added Cebiso. A passenger, who asked not to be named, said the driver was quick to call the ambulance. “We cannot blame Golden Arrow for this. By the time the ambulance arrived, the woman was sadly dead,” said the passenger. Another passenger Thulani Malambile said ever since the Covid-19 pandemic, strange things had been happening. “That woman didn’t show any symptoms of being sick. A lot has happened since this deadly virus arrived; we are depressed because there is no money. I feel for her family. Imagine getting a call that your mother died while sitting inside a bus, and she is not coming back home. We need prayers; we need God to forgive us for whatever we have done,” said Malambile. Captain FC van Wyk said Wynberg police were investigating an inquest case after a woman died in a bus. “She boarded the Golden Arrow bus in Cape Town to Wynberg. When she arrived, she collapsed and died,” said Van Wyk. A post mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death.
