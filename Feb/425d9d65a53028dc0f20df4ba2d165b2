THE Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has recovered billions of rands of embezzled funds after being strengthened by the establishment of a special tribunal. This was revealed by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola during the Sona debate. After opposition MPs attacked President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address, Lamola pointed out that R1,5 billion had been recouped from BP South Africa alone. He said auditor-general reports could now be referred to law enforcement agencies for criminal investigations. Lamola said civil service reforms were also underway and plans to professionalise the civil service had been published for comment. ISIBAYA ACTRESS ARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER! Lamola revealed that the National Advisory Council announced by Ramaphosa during his address would be operational within two years to ensure a multi-disciplinary agency was put together. He said the Fusion Centre, created to co-ordinate issues related to Covid-19 corruption, was bearing fruit. “There is work that is being done. The Financial Intelligence Centre has blocked R145,6 million and 72 bank accounts. “The Asset Forfeiture Unit has preserved R192 million through the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. The Special Investigating Unit has, to date, enrolled cases in the special tribunal to the value of R365 million and saved R124 million involving supply chain irregularities,” said the minister. Lamola said it was a lie when opposition MPs said no action was taken against those found to have committed irregularities during the disaster period.
