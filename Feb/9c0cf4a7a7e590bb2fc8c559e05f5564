PATROLLERS in Langa, Cape Town, are working hard to ensure residents follow lockdown rules and regulations. Their chairman, Bandile Gcuwa, urged residents to always wear their masks and maintain social distancing. “We’re doing this because we care about them and don’t want everything to be done by government. “When we see residents without masks, we turn them back home and they don’t give us problems because they know our work in the community,” said Bandile. He said some residents asked them why they got arrested at night while they wore masks. “We all know it is not only about the mask, but also the curfew. Everyone must be at home and if found in the street without a permit or are not a patrol member, then you’ll be arrested,” he said. Bandile said they had the right to call police when they see residents in the streets at night. He said residents should work with government to fight the pandemic. Resident Zikhona Bandezi (38) said she didn’t understand why people needed to be policed. “This is our health, not government or the patrollers. Why can’t we do what is needed? We need to do our part because people are losing their lives,” she said. Another resident, Themba Nkomo (47), said people liked to complain. “The rules are clear. It’s just that our people like to do the opposite of what is needed from them. Patrollers are doing a good thing. “They must continue keeping our area safe,” said Themba.
