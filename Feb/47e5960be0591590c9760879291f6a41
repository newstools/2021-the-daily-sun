THE family of a 13-year-old girl has been left devastated after she was raped, allegedly by a neighbour. Speaking to Daily Sun, the mum of the victim from Nyanga in Cape Town said on Friday 29 January, she saw her daughter’s friend without her and became worried. “I asked her friends where she was and no one knew. She later came home and didn’t say anything to anyone,” said the mum. She said the girl didn’t say anything until a neighbour came and spoke to her daughter. “She told my neighbour she was raped for about four hours by the suspect. What hurts me most is that the suspect is also a neighbour. How could he do this to my young girl?” she asked. The mum said when she checked her daughter, she was bleeding. Residents went to the suspect’s shack but he had fled. He’s still on the run.  “That monster even had the nerve to ask me to drop the case. “He phoned me and asked how much money I wanted. I told him he must go to hell because he cannot rape my child.” The mum said she suspected it was not the first time the man had raped a child. “I think he has been raping kids and paying their parents to keep quiet. I want him to be arrested. I believe when he is in jail, he will not rape other kids.” A resident said the suspect was not South African and rented his shack. He said parents needed to report these cases and not accept money to drop them. The police’s Sergeant Mfundo Nyengane said a case of rape was opened, but the suspect was still at large.
