PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has downgraded
the country from adjusted level 3 to level one which opens up a bit of movement
although he warned that health protocols should still be observed. Ramaphosa said the decision by Cabinet to
downgrade the level was based on the assessment so far but cautioned that the
threat of the 3rd wave remained and so are threats of other variants of the
deadly disease. The easing of restrictions now means the
hours of the curfew will now be from 12 midnight to 4am and gatherings will be
permitted, subject to limitations on size, adherence to social distancing and
other health protocols. Ramaphosa said these included religious,
social, political and cultural gatherings. He added that the sale of alcohol
will still be permitted though he did not specify whether this has been
extended to the existing operation hours. He said the maximum number of people
allowed at any gathering is 100 people indoors or 250 people outdoors and Where
the venue is too small to accommodate these numbers with appropriate social
distancing, then no more than 50 percent of the capacity of the venue may be
used. Ramaphosa said night vigils or other
gatherings before or after funerals are still not permitted. Ramaphosa said the fight against the
deadly virus continues and announced that 60 000 people have so far been
vaccinated and this programme of vaccination will be key in this battle. “As our vaccination campaign gathers
pace, we must continue to exercise extreme caution to protect ourselves and
others. Together with our scientists and experts, we will continue to monitor
the situation closely and adapt our approach responsively and flexibly. “This pandemic has taken much from us,
but it has not taken our strength, our courage, or our sense of solidarity as a
people,” he said. The alert level 1 takes effect as soon as
the restrictions are gazetted which is expected to be tonight.
