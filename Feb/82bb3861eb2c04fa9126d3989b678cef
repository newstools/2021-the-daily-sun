HER boyfriend often fetched her and she would sleep at his place. Lesiah Sithole (34) usually returned home, but her mum hasn’t seen her since 5 February after her boyfriend fetched her. Now Nomalanga Sithole (55) from Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni is worried about her daughter. She said she called her several times, but her phone rang unanswered. “I’m broken. I thought she was at her boyfriend’s place, but I became worried when her employer called to ask about her whereabouts as she had not reported to work,” said Nomalanga. “My daughter is responsible and will not disappear without telling people about her whereabouts.” Nomalanga told Daily Sun that she had strange dreams after her daughter’s disappearance. “I see her cry for help, but I can’t help because I don’t know where she is. This is killing me.” She said she didn’t know much about Lesiah’s relationship as it was about three months old. “I only know the boyfriend as Sambo. “He told my daughter he’s a teacher at one of the schools in Etwatwa. “I don’t know where he lives or have his contact details,” said Nomalanga.
