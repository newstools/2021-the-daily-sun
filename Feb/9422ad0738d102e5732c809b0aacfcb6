AFRICAN champions Al Ahly shocked Brazilian giants Palmeiras to win the third-place play-off of the Club World Cup in a penalty shoot-out on Thursday. After a goalless 90 minutes, the game went straight to penalties and Al Ahly captain Mohamed El-Shenawy saved the final spot-kick attempt from ex-Juventus midfielder Felipe Melo to seal a 3-2 shootout victory. European champions Bayern Munich take on Mexico's Tigres in the final at Al Rayyan, near Doha, later on Thursday. Egyptian side Al Ahly lost 2-0 to Bayern in Monday's semifinal, thanks to two Robert Lewandowski goals, while Palmeiras lost their semifinal 1-0 to Tigres. -REUTERS
