WHEN HER lover wounded her and killed her mother, Mbali helped cops to look for the suspect. But Mbali has had a change of heart. SHE REFUSES TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HER MOTHER! It was in May 2019, when Mbali Ntuli broke up with her lover as he had allegedly shot her and her mum. Her mum died on the spot and Mbali was rushed to hospital and survived. At first, the woman from Mzimhlophe Hostel in Soweto helped cops look for the suspect. But she later got back together with him and refused to testify! PICS: MAKHI HAS US HOSTAGE! When cops told her it was against the law not to testify after witnessing a crime, Mbali still wasn’t prepared to work with them. She ran away and cops have been struggling to find her. A family member told Daily Sun Mbali should testify in court to get justice for her mum. “It’s the right thing to do. I don’t know what’s got into her. She decided to love the man who took her mum away. It’s shocking,” she said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the court has issued a warrant of arrest for Mbali. Daily Sun published a story about the incident in 2019 and at the time Mbali, who said her name was Hope, told the SunTeam all she wanted was for her boyfriend to be arrested. The suspect was later bust and is in custody waiting for trial. Masondo said the South Gauteng High Court needed Mbali to testify. “According to information received, she lives at the suspect’s home in Kranskop, KZN.” He said anyone with information should call Detective Warrant Officer Thulani Hlungwani on 011 983 3342, or their nearest police station
