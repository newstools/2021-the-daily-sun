MANAKA Ranaka is back at work on the set of Generations: The Legacy after taking maternity leave. She told Daily Sun that she said she missed her little boy every minute she was away from him. “It feels great being back at work but I don’t spend a minute without missing my little one. “Not being with him has left a bitter taste,” said Manaka. She said she wanted to train her son to grow into a successful man who didn’t see gender. “I don’t think there’s anything special about being a man. “I want my son to grow up not knowing about or subscribing to gender roles,” she said. The award-winning actress said she wanted to teach her son the same values she had taught her older children. “I want him to see people as human beings and to respect them for who they are. “He must appreciate and love people,” said Manaka. She said Covid-19 regulations had changed the way she lived. “As a result, I’m always at home or at my boyfriend’s place. I’m really enjoying being a mother again, even though it’s nothing new to me.” Manaka said that she looked forward to reprising her role as Lucy and viewers could look forward to a lot of drama with her on-screen lover, Luthando.
