THE past year has been difficult for boozers and sellers but this week, they’re rejoicing again. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Monday that the alcohol ban was lifted. During an update on the Covid-19 situation, Ramaphosa said alcohol would be allowed to be sold in shops from Monday to Thursday between 10am and 6pm and at bars and taverns throughout the week. Yesterday, boozers could be seen making their way to liquor stores across the country. Despite the heavy rain, many were buying in bulk. Speaking to Daily Sun, shoppers said they were worried the ban would be brought back. Godfrey Chauke (41), who bought three cases of Hansa Pilsener quarts, said: “I’ve realised that they lift the ban when many people have spent their monthly salaries and are left with nothing. ‘I decided to spend my last money on booze to ease the thirst.” Another boozer said he bought in bulk so he could resell at a high price when the ban was brought back. “However, the alcohol ban is unfair. I don’t think it’s the main reason for the spread of the virus. For some of us, we have found ways to make money out of these constant bans because jobs are scarce,” he said. Tavern owner Josiah Kekana (56) said the booze ban had left his family struggling. “We have been pleading to sell takeaways between Monday and Thursday because it will make a difference. When alcohol is banned, it’s difficult to make it through the month.”
