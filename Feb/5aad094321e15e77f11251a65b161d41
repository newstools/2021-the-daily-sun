BONGANI Zungu faces a bleak Bafana Bafana future with his selection for the next camp uncertain. It doesn’t rain but pours for the Rangers midfielder, whose life has been turned upside down following his misconduct in Glasgowlast week. He was dropped from Steven Gerrard’s team for the last two matches after he broke the Covid-19 rules in Scotland last week. He is in isolation with five other players, who attended a house party. To add to his woes, Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has hinted that further action could be taken against Zungu. This could see him miss out on the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier match against Ghana next month. Said Ntseki: “Yes, we’ve had some stories about Bongani in terms of discipline, but as of now I can’t comment much. “We still have to speak to his club. I had a meeting with Safa CEO (Tebogo Motlanthe), looking into the matter. “As soon as we’ve gathered all the information, we’d be able to speak to the player and then consider what should happen to Bongani in terms of the punishment he is going to get from his club for breaking the Covid regulations. It’s important to have that information before going into the selection and the announcement of the Bafana team.” Zungu joined Rangers on loan from French side Amiens, but he is yet to entrench himself in Gerrard’s Rangers team. So far he has made 11 appearances as a substitute and only one start since he arrived at the beginning of the season. Gerrard has condemned his behaviour and has intimated his chances of securing a permanent deal from Amiens are as good as gone. But Ntseki would not want to condemn one of his key players to the scrapheap, as he needs his experience. “We should not be punitive in a case like this but should try to get more information than we have. We need each other for the benefit of the team‚ and also for the success of the players as individuals,” Ntseki added.
