THE hard work and dedication of Charlotte Maxeke Hospital hasn’t gone unnoticed. They were shown appreciation by Checkers on Friday. The retailer donated 1 200 care packages to healthcare workers at the hospital and Covid-19 patients. Award-winning Soweto Gospel Choir entertained staff. Michelle Botha from Checkers said: “Covid-19 has taught us many lessons, including who the true heroes are. “At Checkers we place great value on the communities we serve and will continue to support those impacted by this pandemic.” CEO Gladys Bogoshi thanked the retailer. Bogoshi touched on the critical role the hospital plays in society. “Charlotte Maxeke is the only accredited hospital that used to admit patients with infectious diseases such as typhoid and Ebola before Covid-19,” she said. “We knew about this disease even before it was talked about in the papers as we have experts here whose job is to track these diseases. “We were the first hospital to admit a Covid-19 patient in the public sector on 7 March and since then we have treated many patients, even our staff who turned positive.”
