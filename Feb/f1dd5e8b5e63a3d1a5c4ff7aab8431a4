KAIZER Chiefs Gavin Hunt is taking an 18-man squad to Morocco for their Caf Champions League assignment. The Amakhosi coach has another crucial league match, the DStv Premiership fixture against AmaZulu next Wednesday, in mind. But that is not to say he is not taking the group C Champions League group C opener seriously. The tight schedule and a stretched squad mean Hunt must manage his team well if he is to arrest the slide into mediocrity on the domestic front. The 2020-21 campaign has already seen Amakhosi in action almost twice a week. They played eight games last month, including a trip to Angola where they faced Primeiro de Agosto in the second leg of their Champions League first round match. They fly out to North Africa via Western Asia and should reach the Moroccan city on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday afternoon. Chiefs drawn in Group C for the 2020-21 CAF Champions League Group Stage’s will face Wydad as well as Guinean side Horoya and Angolan team Petro de Luanda. The trip to Casablanca is Amakhosi’s second to Morocco. They previously faced Raja Casablanca in the Champions League first round in 2015. Chiefs are the sixth South African team after Ajax Cape Town, Mamelodi Sundowns, Manning Rangers, Orlando Pirates and SuperSport United to participate in the group stages of the Champions League. It is also the sixth time as a coach that Gavin Hunt is taking part in the CAF Champions League, it is the first time he participates in the group stages. He leads a third different team in the competition having previously been at the helm of SuperSport and Wits.
