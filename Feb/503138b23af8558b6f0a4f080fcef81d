Crosstown rivals Pretoria Callies and JDR Stars will meet in a Nedbank Cup round of 16 match at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville on Sunday afternoon. Kick-off is at 3pm CAT (SA, GMT+2). Both teams have enjoyed a strong run of form in the GladAfrica Championship and currently occupy a place in the top five. Callies, who were only promoted to South Africa's second division last season, have only lost once in their last eight fixtures and beat Royal AM 1-0 in their round of 32 tie. Soshanguve-based Stars also edged a fellow GladAfrica Championship club, defeating Pretoria University 2-1 and are unbeaten in five matches heading into Sunday's knockout encounter. The Hammer Boys are coached by owner Nditsheni Masisi, who is an attorney by trade, while Callies are managed by former professional Sammy Troughton who has been long acquainted to football in the country's capital. Stars were comprehensive 2-0 winners away to the Romans when the teams met in the league early last month, as first-half goals from Vusimuzi Mncube and Temptation Chiwunga settled the contest. -SuperSport
