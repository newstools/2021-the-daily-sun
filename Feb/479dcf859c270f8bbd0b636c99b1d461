PROMISING young rapper Abenct “21 Da Capital” Haile is aiming to win over hip-hop lovers with his new punchlines and verses. Even though the 15-year-old musician from Stanger, KZN, is still doing grade 10, he was able to release three singles and is working on others. 21 Da Capital told SunBuzz that he was working on his new single, to be released at the end of next month. “I love the hip-hop genre, and I grew up listening to it. I started writing my own song and performed for my friends when I was in grade 5,” he said. “But I started to take music as a possible career in 2019 when I released two singles, titled Waterproof and Pribapor. They received a warm welcome. ALSO READ: UZALO STAR: PEOPLE SEE ME AS A JOKE! “Last year, I released my third single No Place, featuring Bhizer.

I like their work and I want to be like them,” he said. 21 Da Capital wants to study architecture at university after matric. “After graduating as a qualified architect, I’ll continue with my music career and release many albums. “I think it’s better to have another job while doing music so you don’t do it out of hunger. “I’d love to be an architect and musician. That is exactly what I plan to do in the future.” 21 Da Capital’s music is available on digital platforms.
