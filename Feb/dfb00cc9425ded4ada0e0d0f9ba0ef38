PATRICK Dlamini (49) was buried on Thursday after lying in a mortuary for a week following a heated battle over his body by his family and lover Friddah Mayimele. The war seems not yet over as his family in Cunningmoor in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, is still struggling to get his firearm, ID, bank cards and clothes from his lover, who was living with him at her home nearby Marite. Instead of handing over his belongings to the family, Friddah allegedly hired hitmen to kill them. Patrick’s elder daughter Felicia Dlamini (35) told Daily Sun that since Friday, they had been receiving death threats from two men, claiming to have been hired by Friddah to kill them. “We received calls from two hitmen who later confessed they were hired by Friddah to kill us. They said she paid them R4 000 for the job. Dad was a guard in Emalahleni, and we didn’t receive any cent from his workplace, policies or the bank. She refuses to give us his gun, ID, death certificate, bank cards and clothes. We are no longer safe as she is now after us,” said Felicia. Patrick’s brother mkhulu Keepers Dlamini (60) told Daily Sun that Friddah stole his body and tried to bury him at her home. He said they were thankful when his body was finally released to them for burial after intervention by Contralesa president and Mathibela Traditional Council leader Kgoshi Lameck Mokoena. Last week, Daily Sun contacted Friddah and she denied all allegations. “The family is making up the whole story. I have released everything, including Patrick’s body, to be buried at his home,” she said.
