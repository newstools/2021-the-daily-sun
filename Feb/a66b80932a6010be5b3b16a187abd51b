AN inner-coffin designed for protection against corona and other infectious diseases will soon be available. Not only will it protect mourners, it will address people’s ancestral concerns. Johan Rousseau of the Funeral Industry Reformed Association said the coffins are safe to be used for night vigils. Metal-based products are used to develop the inner-coffin with a glass pane. The metal will enable families to touch the glass without risk of transmission. He said wrapping coffins won’t work as fluids infect underground water. In recent months, wrapping of coffins and burial of wrong bodies emerged and funerals have been identified as super-spreaders. Last week, the Department of Health said wrapping coffins was only necessary where graves are in areas with a lot of water. The department said the World Health Organisation indicates transmission from human remains has not been proven. The coffins are strictly to be sold to coffin manufacturers and funeral parlours. Pricing hasn’t been determined, but it will be cheaper than the cost of PPEs. The coffin was tested with South African Bureau of Standards guidelines. They’ll approach relevant government departments.  A family in Soweto, who lost their mother to Covid-19 in August, told Daily Sun they couldn’t give her a dignified funeral. “We were denied the chance to view her body, but after a fight one member was allowed to see her,” said a family member. Cultural expert Mtimande Ngwenya said: “Wrapping bodies and coffins in plastic is an insult to us cultural people.” The department said: “New directions don’t prescribe covering of coffins with plastic, use of biohazard stickers, full PPE by funeral directors, as well as sanitising of graves or clothes of people at the funeral.”
