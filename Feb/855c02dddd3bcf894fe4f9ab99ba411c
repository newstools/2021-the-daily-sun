THE Gauteng Department of Health has served Dr Lekopane Mogaladi, the CEO and accounting officer of Tembisa Hospital, with a notice to place him on precautionary suspension. Spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said the notice was served on Friday. “This was as a result of the health ombudsman report into the death of Shonisani Lethole at Tembisa Hospital.  She said department was committed to implementing the recommendations of the report by the ombudsman. Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba found that Lethole was not offered food for more than 100 hours and 54 minutes in Tembisa Hospital. Lethole was admitted to the facility in June with breathing difficulties and died before receiving his results, which showed he’d tested positive for Covid-19. Before he died Lethole (34) reached out to Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize on social media about what he termed deplorable conditions at the hospital, and he claimed that he was being starved. Makgoba has recommended that disciplinary action be taken against 19 staff members at the hospital and that Gauteng Health MEC Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi urgently appoints an independent forensic and audit firm to assess the competency of the leadership and management staff at the hospital. “The firm should also review and revise hospital’s admission policy and processes,” said Makgoba. He said among other transgressions, Dr Mogaladi failed to report missing clinical notes to the police as required by law. He said the care rendered to the late Lethole was not only substandard but also negligent. “This uncaring attitude represented gross medical negligence,” Makgoba said.
