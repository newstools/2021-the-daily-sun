THE 2022 Lexus IS 500 F Sport Performance is taking the fight straight to BMW 340i and the Mercedes-Benz C43. The Lexus IS 500 F Sport Performance brings with it a beefy V8 engine that packs a punch. This sedan launches Lexusâ€™ F Sport Performance line, a lineup of cars that are more hardcore but not quite as mean as the full-fat F models much like the IS-F. The IS 500 F Sport Performance packs a naturally aspirated 5.0-litre V8 producing 352 kW at 7,100 rpm and 535,5 Nm of torque. The only gearbox option is an eight-speed automatic and can hit 96 km/p in 4,5 seconds.
