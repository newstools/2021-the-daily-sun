WE are excited. . . the vaccines are here! That was President Cyril Ramaphosa’s reaction as he received the Covid-19 vaccine at OR Tambo International Airport from India today. Accompanied by Deputy President David Mabuza, he checked the delivery receipt attached to the cargo. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said finding storage won’t be a challenge as some laboratories were equipped to render that service. The vaccine is said to be on its way to Bloemfontein, Free State, to be checked for breakage and quality. The medical fraternity said its delivery couldn’t have come at a better time. Earlier in the day, Ramaphosa asked unions to get involved. Addressing the Nedlac labour school, he said: “A comprehensive roll-out strategy and an accompanying logistical framework will need to be implemented in partnership with labour, the private sector, civil society, traditional leadership, the religious sector and others. Many of those prioritised in the first two phases – healthcare and other frontline workers in particular – are members of unions represented here. “It’s vital that they be ready to be vaccinated and the doses reach them without undue delay.” First up to be vaccinated will be frontline workers, followed by essential workers in the second phase, and adults in phase three. Ramaphosa said he’s aware of concerns that there has not been enough transparency. He said labour unions were prominent among those in society who demanded answers from government.
