RADIO and TV personality Thando Thabethe has blessed her mother with a sprawling new house. In a video she shared on social media, she showed off the new home she bought for her mother. The video was captioned: “Best thing I ever did. Bought my mom a house,” accompanied by the song Dear Mama by Tupac. Although she has achieved a lot in her career, Thando told Daily Sun that this was the biggest achievement of her life. “This is my greatest achievement. My mother was excited and grateful,” she said. Last year, she surprised her mum with a new Mercedes-Benz. Other local stars who’ve spoilt their parents include rapper AKA, who bought his mother a car and house last year. Radio and TV personality Pearl Modiadie bought her father a house.
