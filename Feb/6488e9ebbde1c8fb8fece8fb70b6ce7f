The Hawks believe that they have dismantled a suspected
hijacking syndicate with the recent arrest of two people. According to the crime-fighting unit, the two people are
believed to be linked to the notorious vehicle hijacking syndicate that has
been operating in multiple provinces since 2008. "A project-driven investigation has consequently linked
them to more than 17 hijacking incidents thus far," Hawks spokesperson
Colonel Katlego Mogale said in a statement. "The syndicate's reign of terror includes incidents in
Johannesburg, Cape Town, the North West and the Free State provinces." Mogale said the syndicate was on law enforcement officers'
radar for a while and that the two people were arrested during an
interprovincial takedown operation. One of them is expected to appear in the Palm Ridge
Magistrate's Court on Wednesday and the other is scheduled to make his first
appearance in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Their arrests come after Sharief Solomon, 36, who is also
believed to be a part of the syndicate, was arrested earlier in February in
Cape Town. "Solomon appeared on the 15th of February 2021 [in] the
Goodwood Magistrate's Court," Mogale said. "The matter is expected to be centralised soon to allow
for the three to appear in the same dock to face charges of hijacking and
possession of stolen vehicles." SOURCE: NEWS24
