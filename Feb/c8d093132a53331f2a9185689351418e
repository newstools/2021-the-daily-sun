DUDUZA cops are looking for the family of a man who was found trapped in a bakkie. The man drowned after the bakkie plunged into the river. It was found lying on its roof in the early hours of Friday, 12 February. Sergeant Harry Manaka said the police were alerted by passersby who noticed the car floating in the river along the R550 road next to Driemanskap in Duduza, Ekurhuleni. “On arrival, the police found a silver Mazda Drifter double cab bakkie with registration number HN 47 GP GP in the river, a few metres from the main road. The police could not access the car as the water current was too strong. As a result, divers from the SAPS Water Wing Unit were brought in.” A search ensued and ultimately, the body of a man was found trapped inside. “The man is unknown, and the police suspect that he might have lost control of his vehicle, leading it to plunge into the river stream.” The police are calling for anyone who has information on the identity of the man to contact the Duduza SAPS on 071 675 7027 or 082 828 6048.
