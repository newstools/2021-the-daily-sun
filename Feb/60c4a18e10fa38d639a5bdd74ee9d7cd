FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s shirt has raised eyebrows. While South Africans had been keeping their ears on the ground, wondering what the sudden tea meetings were about, the other thing they were confused about was why he kept wearing the same shirt. He first wore it during his tea meeting with EFF leader Julius Malema. He then wore it again when he met hip-hop star Cassper Nyovest. Today, the former president wore the same shirt when meeting Police Minister Bheki Cele.  Some people were left really curious about the shirt. Jabulani Senior said maybe Zuma was just trying to show Mzansi that he was a consistent man who had less time choosing outfits and spent more time in constructive meetings with prominent people. Ace Mbele speculated that the shirt was the reason everyone suddenly wanted to meet and greet Zuma. He further stated that he’d love to buy it for himself so it could maybe bring back his lost lovers. “Maybe we’re just reading too much into things, but Zuma needs to tell us a story behind this shirt,” said Mbele.  Kagiso Monyandiwa also asked for an explanation, even questioning if this was just the former president’s favourite shirt or if he was just confusing the enemy. Anathi Sanderson said the shirt would be studied by future generations, adding that she believed there was a deeper meaning to it and that one day, Zuma would reveal the reason behind it. Some people speculated that it was for protection, with Lethabo saying izangoma probably advised Zuma to wear it when meeting with people he did not trust.
