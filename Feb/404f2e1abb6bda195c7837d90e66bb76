KAIZER Chiefs have been knocked out of the Nedbank Cup. The Glamour Boys were anything but as they suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to minnows Richards Bay at FNB Stadium on Sunday. Austin Dube and Siyabonga Vilane were on target for the GladAfrica Championship side while Leonardo Castro scored for Chiefs. Dube was part of the TS Galaxy outfit that shocked Amakhosi in the final of the same competition back in 2019. Chiefs do not have happy memories in this competition in recent years as they were part of history for the wrong reasons. Their struggles against lower league teams continue and they now have slim chances of ending their trophy drought. They were knocked out of the MTN8 and are now dumped out of the Ke Yona Cup. They continue to struggle in the league and look unlikely to end the season with any silverware. Gavin Hunt handed Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya and Siphelele Ntshangase rare starts in the Chiefs line-up. He also recalled Kgotso Moleko, Happy Mashiane, Bernard Parker and Darrel Matsheke. Chiefs started strong and were going forward but were unable to carve out any openings. And they were made to pay as Dube ensured Richards Bay took a 1-0 lead to half time. Chiefs, even though they were a man down after Ntiya-Ntiya saw red, did find the equaliser through Castro. But Vilane broke Chiefs hearts with the winner late on. Chiefs coach Hunt could not hide his disappointment. “Very embarrassing,” said Hunt. “This has never happened to me in many years of coaching.” His counterpart Simo Dladla was ecstatic. “It was a tough game,” said Dladla. “We had a plan and stuck to the plan. We were in a good run and we kept that going. I told them that if we remain compact they can’t think.”
