THE families of the two kids who drowned in a mining dam described them as brave. Friends Lufuno Nkuna (8) and Hlayiso Mangue (9) died after they allegedly went to swim on Wednesday, 3 February. They were both buried at Lillydale Cemetery in Mpumalanga on Sunday, 7 February. Lufuno’s gogo, Sarah Makutu (69), said: “We’re in pain and it will take time to accept that our grandson is no more. He was young and brave. We expected a lot of things from him, but death has robbed us of him.” Hlayiso’s mother, Fortunate Mkhabela (34), also described her son as brave. She said he dreamt of becoming a policeman. “It’s painful and it’s going to take years to accept that my son is gone for good. He was a happy kid who liked to entertain us by dancing. “His death has left us with a lot of questions,” said Fortunate. Induna Julius Nyalungu (75) advised parents to guard their kids and not allow them to swim in the dam. “We gathered here to lay to rest young kids whose deaths could have been prevented. “I want to ask parents to ensure that they known their kids’ whereabouts at all times. I don’t want a similar incident to happen again,” said Nyalungu.
