THE crowning of Miss Drag South Africa is nearing the end as the top 10 contestants have been announced. The popular beauty pageant began in 2017 as a vehicle in which the drag community could teach and educate communities to respect and show tolerance towards people from diverse sexual orientation, cultural, religious and racial backgrounds. Previous winners of the jaw-dropping pageant include teacher Zilin Ayoki, Port Elizabeth-based entrepreneur Miss Vicky and the reigning Miss Drag SA Belinda Qaqamba Ka-Fassie, who is an activist and teacher. According to the organisers, the event is much more than just a beauty pageant or modelling competition. Each finalist must initiate a “Drag with a Purpose” project to advocate for the advancement of LGBTIQA+ rights and drag culture, as well as serve as agents of change and uplift their communities.
