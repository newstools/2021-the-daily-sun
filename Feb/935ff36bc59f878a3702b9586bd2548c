Sphuzo, who made a name for himself by singing funny songs on Facebook, died at his home at KwaDweshula, southern KZN, after he suffered from a stroke. Before he died, he wrote on his Facebook page: “Greetings, I trust you are all good. I’m not well at all. “My health is too bad. Please pray for me to get well soon.” His manager Brian Cele confirmed the news of his death to Daily Sun. He said Sphuzo (56) died on Tuesday afternoon, 23 February, after a short battle with a stroke that attacked him in the morning. “He was good and had a healthy life while he was enjoying his late age of success in life and music.

After the news of his death broke on Facebook, many people were shocked and paid their tributes to him. Many of them asked: Who will make us laugh now? Sphuzo became an overnight social media sensation in 2017 after his neighbour Brian Cele started recording and uploading videos of him singing a mixture of gospel and maskandi songs, with a twist of humour, on Facebook. The funny man didn’t allow his age and where he was from stop him from chasing his entertainment dreams. Sphuzo stole many social media users’ hearts. His videos, showing his teethless mouth, used to go viral. He finally became a professional musician as he wished last year and released his debut album titled Guava Juice. His album also received a warm welcome from music lovers and social media fans.
