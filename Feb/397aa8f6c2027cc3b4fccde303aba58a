A GROUP of men have been terrorising residents in the West Rand, going to houses and robbing people. But their luck ran dry on Wednesday, 24 February. After a house in Krugersdrop was robbed, the West Rand District Trio Task Team worked tirelessly to find the men. The group had stolen valuables including a 2019 Hyundai Accent in Krugersdrop. The task team looked everywhere hoping to spot the car. And they spotted it in Randfontein.  Two suspects were found with the car and were arrested. They were in possession of three rifles, a plasma TV, a laptop and jewellery. Their Toyota Corolla GSX was also tampered with as the VIN number did not match the engine. West Rand District police commissioner Major-General Fred Kekana commended the task team. He said they expected to link the arrested suspects to other crimes that have happened in the West Rand. He said more suspects, who are possibly working with the arrested ones, are also expected to be arrested soon.  “We appreciate the hard work the team is doing. Through their swift response, they were able to trace the robbers and recover everything they had stolen in Krugersdrop.” He said as the police, they have dedicated themselves to working around the clock and making sure that people are protected. He applauded the task team formed of detectives which he said dealt specifically with house robberies, car hijackings and business robberies.
