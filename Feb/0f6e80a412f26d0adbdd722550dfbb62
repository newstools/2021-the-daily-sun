SHE hasn’t been able to sleep properly since her daughter went missing on 1 February. The mother looked everywhere for the little girl with no luck. Zanele Nyembezi is now asking SunReaders to help find three-year-old Simphiwe. The 26-year-old from Phumla Mqashi in Vlakfontein, south of Joburg, told Daily Sun Simphiwe was playing with her friends on the day she went missing. But she was nowhere to be found when Zanele’s father called out to her to come eat. “When we asked her friends where she was, they told us she left with her gogo. “This old woman took my daughter and two of her friends to buy sweets and when her friends asked Simphiwe who she was, she told them it’s her grandmother,” said Zenele. She said the gogo took Simphiwe with her after they bought sweets. “Her friends told us they didn’t report this to the family as Simphiwe told them it’s her gogo.” Zanele said the woman was wearing a sangoma’s cloth and a white doek. “Residents have gone into every sangoma’s house looking for this woman, but she hasn’t been found. Last Wednesday, residents went to an old woman who allegedly steals kids, but didn’t find her. They burnt her house,” said Zanele. She said Simphiwe was wearing pink tights, a powder blue jersey as well as blue and pink flip flops when she went missing. “I can’t eat because I don’t know what condition she is in. I won’t rest until I find her. I hope and pray I find her alive and safe.” Zanele said she posted her child on Facebook, hoping someone might have seen her. Daily Sun spoke to the Gauteng police spokesman, Captain Mavela Masondo who confirmed that a missing person’s case has been opened and no arrests have been made.
