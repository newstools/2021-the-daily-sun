IF this pub owner was going to break the law, he should’ve told his patrons to keep cellphone cameras off. East London cops arrested him for contravening the Disaster Management Act and fined him R5 000 on Monday. A video emerged on social media in which there was no social distancing at the venue, patrons were not wearing masks, and there was a large number of people inside the establishment. Buffalo City municipal spokesman Samkelo Ngwenya said the arrest and fine will send a strong message to other establishments that non-compliance to rules won’t be tolerated. Ngwenya said in the municipality alone, 2 299 people died as a result of Covid-19 and there were 219 active cases as of Sunday, 7 February. “We further call for licence regulators to take tough action against establishments that break the law as this is in breach of their operating licences,” he said. According to Ngwenya, 47 liquor establishments were inspected, 131 cases of alcohol destroyed, 1 038 traffic prosecutions executed and 32 vehicles suspended last week alone. A patron who was at the establishment told the People’s Paper: “It’s happening all over the city. We’re risking our lives. There was not a single person wearing a mask and people shared glasses and beer bottles. “From what I observed, the country will stop selling alcohol again because people don’t care.”
