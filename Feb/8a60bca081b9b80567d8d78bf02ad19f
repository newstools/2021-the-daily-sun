HEAVY rain on Sunday led to a blockage in the sewerage system. Residents’ houses are flooded with kak water and they’re forced to sleep with water in their houses. The frustrated residents of Emaphupheni extention 19 in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, said they’ve been trying to get help from the municipality with no luck. Resident Selloane Matlokotsi (27) said she wore boots in the house to avoid getting infected. “Kids developed a skin rash and adults cough. No one listens to us,” she said. Selloane said they couldn’t even cook as they got shocked by electricity. Everything is wet! Going to the toilet is also a mission,” she said.  “Water has filled the toilet and kak rises up whenever they flush.” Residents said municipal workers don’t unblock the pipes, resulting in sewage flooding their homes,” said another resident, Lawrence Mtshweni (45). Daily Sun visited the area on Tuesday and found the houses were still flooded with kak water. Some residents have put their furniture on top of bricks and placed bricks in their houses so they can walk on top of them. Ekurhuleni spokesman Zweli Dlamini said they would attend to the problem.
