THE Zulu royal house has rubbished claims that King Goodwill Zwelithini is no more. This after rumours circulated on social media that Zwelithini was no more after he was hospitalised last week. Zulu monarch and IFP president Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi released a statement that the death claims pained the royal house. He said they visited the king in the hospital and those close to him flooded them with calls, seeking an update. “This is understandable considering the respect that so many have for the king. “However, several false rumours have also begun circulating that his majesty’s health is being kept a secret and even, most cruelly, that his majesty is no more. “I wish to allay the concerns of the nation regarding these fables. His majesty entered hospital to attend to high glucose levels and is still not frail in any way. “He is fully mobile and is continuing treatment. His doctors preferred he be treated in the ICU in order to attend to this thoroughly,” he said. Buthelezi said one wonders what kind of people would start such cruel false rumours when the king is still alive. “It has inflicted tremendous pain on the royal family and all those who wish the king well,” he said. Buthelezi said that such irresponsible behaviour has been seen before. “Even I have been declared dead while I was still alive. “In the age of social media, false news is disseminated like wildfire. “One can only hope that those who report the news on official channels would have the discernment to treat such serious matters on the basis of fact,” he said.
