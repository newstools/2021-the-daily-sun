THE Nedbank Cup has launched many a career of aspiring footballers over the years. However, this year circumstances have forced the sponsors and PSL to shun the lower league teams (ABC Motsepe and SAB League teams) that usually participate, thus denying young players a chance to showcase their talent. But that does not mean there won’t be new raw talent coming through. Cape Town Spurs, who have produced some great players in the past years, introduced another promising talent a 19-year-old goalkeeper Lincoln Vyver. The Spurs third-choice goalkeeper made his senior team debut against Baroka FC in the Nedbank Cup last-32 on Monday and grabbed his chance with both hands. Vyver made two big saves in the penalty shoot-out when his side pulled a giant-killing act on Baroka which saw him earn praise from his coach Ian Taylor. Spurs triumphed 5-4 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. “I am happy for guy likes Lincoln, whom we have given a chance. He really stuck his hand up and that is what we want to see,” Taylor said. “Players who get opportunities to say, ‘I am here’ and want to give it a go. Well done to the boys, they deserve it.” “I was very happy with the way they applied themselves and showed great character at the end,” Taylor said. Vyver is a product of the famed youth academy at Spurs, who up until the start of this season, played under the banner of Ajax Cape Town. That was before the Dutch giants from Amsterdam sold their shareholding and end a 21-year partnership. Spurs will now visit fellow second-tier side Cape Town All-Stars in the last 16 of the Nedbank Cup. Dates and venues are yet to be confirmed by the PSL.
