SUN WHEELS recently published a video of a VW Polo driver that lost control and fell off a bridge. Well, this time itâ€™s not a Polo that is notoriously known for bad drivers, but a bakkie driver that plunged off a bridge and survived the insane crash. Footage from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, published by FOX6, shows a red bakkie striking the side of a ramp before crashing over a concrete barrier and falling 21m to the road below. The bakkie spun through the air and fell on its wheels. The man reportedly lost control and crashed through a small barrier before falling.
