THE on, off Kaizer Chiefs Caf Champions League fixture is back ON again! Amakhosi will finally open their Champions League group phase campaign against Wydad Athletic within the coming 24 hours, Caf have directed. However, Gavin Hunt’s men will no longer be touring Casablanca. Instead they could be headed for neighbouring Egypt after the Caf Organising Committee for Inter-club Competitions recommended the match be played in a neutral country. The match was initially scheduled for Saturday, but the Soweto giants could not travel to Morocco due to the strict Covid-19 regulations in the North African country. South Africa has been listed as high risk in terms of the Covid-19 pandemic and South African citizens may not be allowed entry into Morocco due to the strict Covid-19 regulation in the country. “We would like to apologise for the inconsistencies the situation has caused to Kaizer Chiefs. As a result of the stricter travel restrictions imposed on South Africa by some countries due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have experienced more difficulties to organise matches in South Africa,” Caf said in a statement.
