Swallows FC will face Cape Umoya United in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 match at the Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 3pm CAT. The Beautiful Birds maintained their unbeaten record in the DStv Premiership when they came back to hold SuperSport United to a 1-1 draw last weekend. Swallows are five-time Nedbank Cup champions having won their last trophy in 2009, but the last time they went beyond the Last 32 was in 2011 and they were eliminated by surprise package Baroka FC. Brandon Truter, the Swallows head coach, says his charges were disappointed after their draw with SuperSport and he made it known that they aim to win all of their home games ahead of the cup game. “As I was greeting the players after the match [on Saturday]‚ you could see the frustration‚” Truter said. “I think within our camp we’re expected to win every game‚ but we must be mindful also that we’re a newly promoted team. Our aim is to get results at Dobsonville. "Scoring so late in games to get the draws, tells you about the character of the team. We don’t give up, we fight to the end.” Meanwhile, Umoya saw their three-match unbeaten run in the GladAfrica Championship come to an end when they lost 1-0 to Royal AM last weekend. The Spirited Ones are only making their third appearance in the Nedbank Cup having reached the quarterfinals in their debut season and they were eliminated in the first round last season. Gareth Ncaca, the Umoya assistant coach, believes they have a team which is capable of performing much better in the current campaign as they prepare for his former club, Swallows. "You know when we started three years ago, we were building and building all the time. This season it's a new team," Ncaca said. "I have got to give it to the players and the people behind the team for the work that's been done, because it's not been easy and we take it one game at a time" -SuperSport
