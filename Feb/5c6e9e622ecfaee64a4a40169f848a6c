OVIDY Karuru is proving to be quite invaluable for Black Leopards this season. But it could well be the Nedbank Cup that affords him the stage to finally make his mark in the PSL since he arrived seven years ago. The former Zimbabwean international bagged a brace as Leopards advance to the Ke Yona Cup second round with a 2-1 win over Jomo Cosmos at Olen Park yesterday. It is hard to tell the difference Leopards and the first division teams this season, and Ezenkosi sure fancies their chances against a team stuck at the bottom in the PSL. And it wasn't until Karuru finally broke the deadlock with a perfect finish in the 80th minute, that Leopards showed their superiority. But their joy was shortlived as Khethukuthula Zwane equalised just seconds later, finishing off Aboubacar Sengare's Messi-like move to silence the hysterical Leopards bench. However, Karuru was not done, heading in the winner with two minutes to go.This time there was no coming back for Ezenkosi, following a goal that literally knocked the wind out of their sails. They held their own against the visitors and could have caused an upset. However, this was not the Ezenkosi team which bagged several domestic cup trophies in the mid-2000s. Leopards are having a torrid time in the Premiership and would need tons of confidence to get themselves from the bottom. As seen in the past, when they went the distance in tournaments, including the Caf Confederation Cup, Lidoda Duvha may have to use the tournament to turn the corner. However, it is still early to tell, given their inconsistency this season. Cosmos, on the other hand, are giving it a real go in the GladAfrica Championship, trailing log leaders by a point on 19. Elsewhere, Swallows edged Cape United 1-0.
