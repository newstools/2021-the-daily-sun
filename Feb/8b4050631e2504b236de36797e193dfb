MEMBERS of the Joburg Metropolitan Police Department recovered cigarettes worth R1,8 million. This after the JMPD k9 officers attended to a complaint of a white Mercedes-Benz Sprinter hijacked in Steeledale on 16 February. The vehicle was carrying a load of cigarettes. JMPD spokesman Xolani Fihla said the hijackers jammed the vehicle’s tracking device, and officers could not properly pinpoint its location. “The tracking unit was later activated near FNB Stadium and officers started tracking the vehicle together with the ground crew from Netstar. That led them to a location in Crosby,” said Fihla. He said upon arrival, officers noticed that the suspects were in the vicinity, busy offloading the stock. “When the suspects noticed the chopper circling the area, they abandoned the cigarettes and vehicle, making a hasty getaway. Officers recovered cigarettes worth R1,8 million and the car.” He said the suspects were still at large, and that further investigation would be conducted.
