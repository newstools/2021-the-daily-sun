Marijuana use might affect the size and shape of a young man's sperm, possibly impairing his fertility, a new study claims. "Our
 data suggests that cannabis users might be advised to stop using the 
drug if they are planning to try and start a family," study author Dr 
Allan Pacey, a senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield in 
England, said in a university news release. "Our knowledge of 
factors that influence sperm size and shape is very limited, yet faced 
with a diagnosis of poor sperm [size and shape], many men are concerned 
to try and identify any factors in their lifestyle that could be causing
 this," said Pacey.     The
 researchers examined how certain lifestyle choices affected the size 
and shape of the men's sperm and found "very few identifiable risks", 
Pacey said. Although cigarettes and alcohol had little effect, the
 study revealed that sperm size and shape was negatively affected if the
 men were younger than age 30 and had smoked marijuana within three 
months. Sperm samples produced during the summer were also nearly twice as likely to be considered "abnormal", the study showed. Read: Male fertility genes discovered The
 study authors noted that sperm size and shape may be linked to other 
factors that were not measured, such as the quality of a man's DNA.  Previous research has suggested sperm need to be of good size and shape to work their way through a woman's body after sex and fertilise an egg.  Men
 exposed to paint strippers and lead are also at risk of having sperm 
with poor shape and size, Nicola Cherry, an epidemiologist and professor
 formerly of the University of Manchester in England, said in the news 
release. https://www.news24.com/health24/medical/erectile-dysfunction/about-erectile-dysfunction/dagga-might-affect-male-fertility-20140606
