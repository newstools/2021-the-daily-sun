  A
 pall of thick smoke created an orange glow in the sky as more than 100 
firefighters, supported by aerial teams, worked to put it out. The fire is being fanned by strong winds. Cape
 Winelands District Municipality spokesperson Jo-Anne Otto said the 
orange glow in the sky was caused by a combination of dry fynbos and 
vegetation that had a high oil content and ash. The Stellenbosch
 Municipality urged Jonkershoek residents to co-operate with officials 
if they arrived at their properties as the fire moved through dry and 
brittle vegetation. Otto said the elderly, young children and 
people with co-morbidities, such as asthma, or those who required extra 
care, should make arrangements to stay with friends or family in other 
areas. "Should you feel threatened and wish to leave your home, 
please secure your home, but leave all gates open," the municipality 
said in an urgent public announcement on Facebook. The Cape Winelands District Municipality's
 Fire Services, CapeNature, Overberg District Municipality and Fire 
Protection Association are part of the team trying to bring it under 
control. Active "The fire teams continued
 with active firefighting, the monitoring and management of flare-ups 
and mopping up operations throughout the night," a statement from the 
municipality said.         The Stellenbosch Municipality said no loss of life or injuries had been reported by early Friday afternoon. Residents
 in the Jonkershoek Valley were advised to remain hydrated, keep windows
 and doors closed, keep pets safe and to remove outdoor furniture where 
possible. Otto said the fire was expected to continue until at least Sunday given the current wind levels and heat forecast.                                                                     News24
