A SECOND suspect has been arrested in connection to a cash-in-transit robbery around Moutse West. The suspect (34) appeared before the Vaalbank Magistrates Court on Thursday, 11 February. He joined his police constable (38) co-accused, but the case was postponed to 17 February for appointment of legal representative.  According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, the second suspect was arrested on Saturday, 6 February at Entokozweni section near Kanyamazane during an intelligence-driven operation. This was after he evaded arrest at the scene. “At the time of the incident, a group of armed suspects accosted three security guards who were replenishing bank ATMs around Moutse West. The guards were disarmed and explosives used to blow up the safe of the truck,” said Sekgotodi. “The suspects then made their getaway using several vehicles with an undisclosed amount of cash. A Mercedes Benz, Audi Q3 and A4 were later found abandoned in near different locations.” Sekgotodi added that a few hours later, a police constable was arrested through a tip-off that led to his hideout. “During the search, an undisclosed amount of money suspected to be stolen from the crime scene was found and seized for further investigation. Both the accused appeared in court, and the case was postponed,” she said. Provincial head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation in Mpumalanga Major General Zodwa Mokoena cherished the multidisciplinary approach by the police. She further urged the public to volunteer information to authorities about the outstanding suspects. Mokoena also warned community members to refrain from interfering with crime scenes of this nature as often onlookers converged and picked up the cash scattered around, thereby implicating themselves to the crime.
