GATVOL residents of Kumani outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, took to the streets over a bridge at the deadly Mutlumuvi River on 25 February. The protesters, led by Sydwell Mabunda, marched and handed over a two-page memorandum to the Mpumalanga Department of Public Works district office in Thulamahashe. They gave the department at least seven working days to respond to their grievances. They recited the challenges they faced with the bridge during rainy days. “When it rains, the deadly river overflows badly. This makes it difficult for both motorists and residents, including pupils, to cross it to go to work, school, the clinic or shopping malls. “We have given the department seven working days to respond to our grievances. Failure to do so will result in a total shutdown in the Thulamahashe, Kumani and Allandale entrances,” shouted the protesters. They said the recent heavy rains had hit the province hard, leaving the dusty road connecting the bridge in a savage state. A part of the road was washed away. “It will be for our interest as Kumani residents to live the reality of tarred road and a better bridge. This will enhance economic activities and convenient movement for everyone. More so, it will reduce further risks and loss of precious life,” said Mabunda. Public works district office acting deputy director, Wilson Molamodi, received and signed the memorandum, promising residents to deliver it to the relevant parties.
