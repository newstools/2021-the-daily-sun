WYDAD Athletic have met the tight 24-hour Caf deadline to secure a venue for their Caf Champions League fixture against Kaizer Chiefs. The match which has postponed twice so far will be played in Burkina Faso at a date yet to be confirmed. The Moroccan side were given 24 hours to find a neutral venue after Amakhosi could not honour the initial fixture due to Covid-19 protocols in the North African country, circumstances beyond their control. Meanwhile, CR Belouizdad have secured a venue for their Caf Champions League fixture against host Mamelodi Sundowns.  The Algerians will host the Tshwane giants at the Benjamin Mkapa stadium in Dar es Salam on 28 February. Sundowns could not travel to Algeria for their match on 23 February due to further medical restrictions in Algeria.  The cancellation came after the Algerian FA requested a postponement due to further medical restrictions in Algeria, whilst Mamelodi Sundowns were preparing for departure to Algeria.  The Brazilians will now travel to Tanzania for their group D fixture against the Algerians.
