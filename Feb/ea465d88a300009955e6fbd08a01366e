WITH Valentine’s Day approaching, many women may find themselves wondering where they stand with the person they’re seeing. Although it might not always be obvious, there are always those subtle signs that a guy will show that will tell you where your relationship stands. From the way he flirts with other girls in your presence to how he treats you, you can tell he’s just not that into you. Here are the five signs that a guy is not that in to you: 1. You’re Always the One Calling You shouldn’t have to beg for attention and affection. 2. He Tells You He’s Not Looking For a Relationship This is a red flag that most women tend to ignore in the beginning and before you know, it is too late. You have fallen while the guy had clearly made his intentions clear that he doesn’t want a relationship. This might also mean that he doesn’t want a relationship WITH YOU. 3. He’s Not Interested in What You Do. If he doesn’t bother to find out the things that you like, then he has no intentions to make you happy. 4. He is Always Busy If you matter, he will find time. Everyone makes time for what is important to them. 5. He Flirts With Other Women Not only is this disrespectful to you but this also tells you a lot about the kind of person he is. He doesn’t consider anyone else’s feelings except his.
