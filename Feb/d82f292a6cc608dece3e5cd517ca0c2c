BROADCASTER
eNCA has responded to the incident that happened during the Budget Speech
involving its reporter Lindsay Dentlinger. The
broadcaster’s management said after meeting with Dentlinger to discuss the
matter, it concluded that her conduct was not racially motivated or with
malicious intent. According
to eNCA, the incident represented an inaccurate and unfair image of her work. “In an
intense live broadcast environment like the Budget Speech coverage, our
journalists are under pressure to remain compliant while delivering accurate
and balanced news. The journalist had to contend with being live on air and
taking producer instructions via her earpiece, and unfortunately failed to
request that the interviewee wear a mask,” said John Bailey, managing editor of
eNCA. Meanwhile,
United Democratic Movement (UDM) president Bantu Holomisa said the eNCA
statement was a slap in the face of any sober South African who witnessed the
incident. ALSO READ: TWITTER LASHES eNCA REPORTER “The UDM
wrote to Bailey on 25 February, expressing our disgust at the racist treatment
Nqabayomzi Kwankwa had suffered at eNCA’s hands. Instead of issuing an
unreserved apology, eNCA chose to defend its journalist’s actions with insipid
excuses,” he said. According
to Holomisa, even the title of the statement was confusing as it denied the
root of the matter – that the aggrieved party was Kwankwa, who was treated
differently to his white colleague. “Whether or
not eNCA or Dentlinger like to hear it, they have gravely insulted and offended
Kwankwa, the UDM as well as countless black and white South Africans who
noticed this racist incident,” he added. He said the
UDM would not let the matter rest, and would make the necessary steps to
approach the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa and South
African Human Rights Commission for relief.
