CHAOS erupted and shots were fired as police clashed with members of the public in Ackerville, eMalahleni, Mpumalanga on Saturday, 20 February. It is alleged that police came to disperse a group of people who had been chilling and boozing past curfew hours. But they were met with resistance and forced to retreat as they were outnumbered by the angry mob, who didn’t want the cops to kill their vibe. It is alleged that one of the cops was manhandled, which led to the men in blue retreating and calling for back-up. Some of the incidences were caught on video, and are now doing the rounds on social media. In one of the videos, a police officer can be seen heading to the van, but he is followed by a man who is zigzagging with a bottle in his hand. With his other hand, he is trying to pull the officer, who is getting away from him. The officer hit him with the back of his gun and he fell flat on the ground. It wasn’t long after that shots, which were allegedly warning shots, were fired. This was an attempt to scare off the mob that was baying for the blood of the “party-pooping” cops.

Spiraling from the funeral, police have since gathered that certain community members behaved unruly, broke the Lockdown Regulations by conducting an after tears event, spinning cars and not wearing masks nor practiced social distancing. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “A police officer who engaged with the community was pulled around by his clothes and vulgar words were used against him for doing his job. Some police vehicles were also pelted with bottles at the same event.” pic.twitter.com/wSez7EAJdk
