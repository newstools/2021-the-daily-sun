FOUR illegal miners were part of the 870 people who were arrested during the police’s Okae Molao operation around Gauteng over the weekend. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said more than 100 suspects were also bust for gender-based violence. He said the police flooded the streets and surrounding areas of Benoni and four men were arrested for illegal mining during the raid at what appeared to be a mining village. Makhubele said cops found equipment used during the commission of illegal mining, explosives which they believe are of the same calibre as those used in cash-in-transit robberies and ATM bombings. “We also found liquor that was abandoned by alleged illegal miners who evaded arrest and ran up the nearby mine dumps,” he said. Makhubele said at the roadblocks, nine cars were impounded for further investigation, while more than 20 undocumented foreigners were arrested. He said in Tshwane, cops arrested motorists for possession of illicit cigarettes. “More than 231 suspects were arrested for various crimes and over 400 were nabbed in Ekurhuleni and Joburg.” He said the suspects will appear in the different magistrates courts soon. Makhubele said the operations were led by Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, who was joined by Ekurhuleni police commissioner Major-General Vincent Leshabane and other top cops, Gauteng Traffic Police, EMPD, Tracker and private security companies.
