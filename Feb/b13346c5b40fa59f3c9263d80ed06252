SWALLOWS FC have maintained their unbeaten run in the DStv Premiership after sharing spoils 1-1 with Cape Town City in a 1-1 on Sunday. Brandon Truter’s Swallows have now played five league matches in a row without getting a victory. And that should be a serious concern if they are to catch up with log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, who are also yet to taste defeat this season. Swallows were the first to find the back of the net through Kgaogelo Sekgota in the 13th minute. However, their lead lasted for 20 minutes as City levelled on the 33rd minute through Mduduzi Mdantsane’s spot-kick. The stalemate means that the teams retain their positions in the standings. Swallows are still third, having collected 30 points in 16 matches, six adrift of runaway log leaders Sundowns. The Citizens are in seventh spot as they have gathered 24 points from 17 leagues games. The two sides went to the half-time break tied on 1-1. Swallows were reduced to 10 men in the 66th minute after defender Junaid Sait received a second yellow card. Swallows assistant coach Thabane Makhura was also sent off during the mini drama. The Citizens were also desperate to get back to winning ways after losing back-to-back matches, against Orlando Pirates and SuperSport United, in their last two away games. But that was not the case as they shared the spoils. Meannwhile, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila registered their third league win after they beat Stellenbosch FC 1-0 at Thohoyandou Stadium in the other league match.
