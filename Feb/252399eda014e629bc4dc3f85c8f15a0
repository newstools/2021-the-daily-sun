THEY operated a small tavern from their bedroom. And they either delivered the booze to customers or the customers went to their place. But residents tipped off cops about the small operation and they pounced on the couple on Sunday. Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate said drugs were found in the couple’s house. Tshilate said Warrant Officer Lukas Wolmarans, Sergeant Vusumuzi Zondo, and Constable Jean-Pierre Lewis received a tip-off about a man and his girlfriend illegally selling drugs and liquor from Victorian Lodge along HF Verwoerd Street in Heidelberg. “On arrival at the premises, they spotted a man following them,” said Tshilate. “Police conducted a body search and found drugs in his possession, as well as a huge amount of money suspected to have been accumulated from selling drugs and liquor. “They took him to his room, where various brands of liquor were found.” They also found more drugs and money suspected to be accumulated from selling liquor and drugs. “Police confiscated liquor, drugs and money,” he told Daily Sun. “Upon interviews with the suspects, it was detected they’re in the country without official documentation and an illegal immigrant charge was added.” The suspects, aged 34 and 29, were also charged with dealing in drugs, possession of drugs and contravention of the Disaster Management Act. They will appear in the Heidelberg Magistrates Court soon. Heidelberg station commander, Colonel Phiwe Ndwandwe, asked the community to report all illegal activity to the police and all information will be treated with strict confidentiality. The community is urged to report any criminal activities by phoning the CrimeStop number 08600 10111, going into the MySAPSApp or by SMSing 32211.
