KWAZULU-NATAL teams have done exceptionally well in the
DStv Pre miership this season, except for Maritzburg United. And that has put a lot of
pressure and uncertainty on United head coach Ernst Middendorp who has admitted
bleeding under the pressure as they are the only KZN team struggling in the
DStv Premiership. Golden Arrows and AmaZulu
FC have been enjoying a good run. They are currently within the top eight in the standings
as they occupy fifth and sixth spots on the log respectively, while United are
languishing at the bottom of the table. “Of course, there’s
always pressure. Who’s causing the pressure? I think everybody knows the
answer,” Middendorp said on Thursday. He continued: “You have
to handle it. I am not really following comments on what people are thinking
I’m focused seven days 24 hours in cooperating in discussing trying to find
solutions with the management.” On Saturday, Middendorp’s
charges host Orlando Pirates in the Nedbank Cup last-16 cup tie. By the look of things,
the Team of Choice could sacrifise the cup competition to fight for survival. After 15 matches in the
league they have only managed to get two victories. In their last five league
games, they only collected a single point where they drew 0-0 against AmaZulu. Despite the poor form,
the German coach remains focused on the main goal which is to save the club
from being relegated at the end of the season. He said: “Remember when I
came in, six games the team had zero points… I made it very clear that this is
a project that will not be finalized in January or in March. “This is a project that
will be finished in May to come in a better position, and you can believe me
the has been reason for it.”
