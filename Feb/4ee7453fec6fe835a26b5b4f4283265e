THE legal team representing Norma Mngoma has suggested that since the Gauteng North High Court has pronounced her arrest and detention unlawful, criminal charges against her should also be dropped by the Pretoria Magistrates Court. Former minister Malusi Gigaba’s wife made a brief appearance on Friday, 12 February, following the High Court judgement on Thursday that declared her arrest unlawful. Mngoma was arrested by the Hawks last July, and had her electronic devices confiscated and later given back after some data was deleted. She was released on R5 000 bail after spending a night at the Brooklyn Police Station holding cells. Mngoma challenged her arrest at the High Court, now calling for her charges of malicious damage to property and crimen injuria to be dropped completely. The charges came after Gigaba had her arrested for allegedly damaging a luxurious car belonging to his friend. Her legal representative Advocate Dali Mpofu told the court that they had always been of the view that the state and magistrate were lied to, making them victims just like Mngoma. “Our submission is that the prosecution was the fruits of a poisoned tree. We will give our colleagues some time to study the judgement and see when they will withdraw the charges,” he said. Mpofu said the Hawks had to pay the costs of the High Court application on a punitive scale. “That portrays the connection. How can the same people be called in a trial? They acted fraudulently with ill motive,” he said. He told the court that they didn’t see it reasonable for the state to continue with the tainted prosecution. The state prosecutor argued that just because the arrest was malicious didn’t mean the prosecution was unlawful. The matter was postponed to 26 March to give the prosecution time to study the judgement and for further representations to be made regarding the charges against her.
