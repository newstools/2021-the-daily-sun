THE biggest challenge for Dan “Dance” Malesela is to pin-point, and possibly solve, the problem that is threatening the progress he appears to be making with the Port Elizabeth-based outfit. A record of two wins, two draws and two losses from six matches doesn’t hint at a crisis. However, their 2-0 loss to Mamelodi Sundowns on Sunday has left him with a headache. He has admitted the scoreline could have been worse, had it not been for Ayanda Mtshali and the two changes he made in the first half. Chippa have been on the road for their past five matches, unable to host matches due to the Covid-19 situation in their home base in the Eastern Cape. “There are quite a number of things that are of concern. I will discuss with the players because this cannot be the same team that played against Swallows and against Leopards. It cannot be the same team,” said Malesela. “I don’t want to apportion this to fatigue. It could be the psychological factor, perhaps also because the cycle is ending and so the mind goes into a bit of a lull. We will find out what is wrong.” “I wouldn’t say it’s fatigue. I’m hoping this is not the case where we make that an excuse. Back in PE, the Chilli Boys will spend the week preparing for their next assignment – the Nedbank Cup Last-32 round fixture against GladAfrica Championship side Free State Stars on Sunday. Chippa have never gone beyond the Last-32 round stage in the Nedbank Cup, but this could be the season they punch above their weight. The tournament has been shortened as a result of the SA Football Association (Safa) pulling out amateur sides, mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This means PSL teams don’t have to worry about the “banana peels”, the challenge from third and fourth tier sides. But there is still a mountain to climb for the Chilli Boys, if they are to reach the semi-final and possibly the final.
