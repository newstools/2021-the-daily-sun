FOR five months Makatu Tshivhula worked at a candle factory, hoping to get a job as a psychologist, when his contract ended. However, the 23-year-old from Pimville, Soweto, was bitterly disappointed when his dream didn’t come true. Makatu, who studied psychology at the Nelson Mandela University in the Eastern Cape, decided to make a plan instead of feeling sorry for himself. In January when load shedding hit Mzansi again, he started producing his own candles. He was lucky to find someone who believed in his idea and bought him equipment. “I got to work immediately and started making candles in different colours. I instantly had customers,” he said. “I have a store near Maponya Mall, and many people realise they need candles when they walk past my shop on the way back from doing their shopping.” But Makatu was surprised to learn most of his clients didn’t use his candles for blackouts. “It’s mostly izangoma who buy them,” he said. “I didn’t know there was such a demand for candles in the spiritual world. “But I’m happy I’m fulfilling their need for candles. “My wish is to employ more people and cut unemployment. “I want the business to grow so I can branch out to other areas and provinces.” Makatu said social media had helped expose his candles. “So many people are on social media. I was surprised to find out a lot of my customers work online,” he said. Makatu said young people needed to think about creating their own employment. He recently started making scented candles. “It’s part of growing my business. I don’t only want to serve healers. I want to cater for romantics as well,” he said.
