Bayern Munich won the Club World Cup final in Qatar on Thursday as Benjamin Pavard's second-half winner sealed a 1-0 victory over Mexico's Tigres, the Germans claiming a "six pack" of titles within 12 months. Pavard's close-range tap-in was enough to give European champions Bayern their sixth title in quick succession. This is the eighth year in a row that the Champions League winners have gone on to win the Club World Cup, as Bayern follow in the footsteps of last year's champions Liverpool. Bayern are the second side to win all six available titles within a year after Barcelona managed the feat in 2009. Hansi Flick's men had already won the Champions League, Bundesliga, German Cup, UEFA Super Cup and German Super Cup last season. "It feels good to have the six pack -- six titles in a row is something very special for us," said Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, who helped set up Pavard's goal. "I think this is one of the biggest achievements in football, how we played will be remembered for a long time. -AFP
