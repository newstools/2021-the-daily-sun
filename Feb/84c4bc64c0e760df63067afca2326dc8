GLADAfrica Championship rookies, Bizana Pondo Chiefs, have "mutually" part ways with their head coach Tshepo Motsoeneng and goalkeeper coach Sibongiseni Ntsele. Motsoeneng, who promoted the Hunters to the national first division, is leaving the club with his tail between his legs as they're now at the bottom of the Championship log. It has been a difficult season for the Bizana. They are at the bottom of the table with 12 points after 14 games. READ: TAU SENT STERN DERBY MESSAGE! Motsoeneng’s last game was a 3-1 loss to Free State Stars this past weekend which led the club to the decision to part ways with him. Pondo Chiefs chairman, Nkosinathi Mqokiyana, said the decision to cut ties with Motsoeneng was not an easy decision. "He has served the club well with loyalty and it is sad that we have to part ways," said the chairman. "We have considered many aspects related to the club,” said Mqokiyana.“ "Motsoeneng has a rich history with this club, helping us gain promotion to the GladAfrica Championship, together with our players who contributed immensely with clean sheets at home. It is now time for the club to be led by somebody else.” Julius Dube, who was Motsoeneng’s assistant, has been appointed caretaker coach. Another factor that could have contributed to Pondo Chiefs’ poor season is that they were not allowed to play games at home in Bizana as they couldn’t secure a venue meeting the PSL standards.
