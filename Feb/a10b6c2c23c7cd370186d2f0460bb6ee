KANANA residents in Gugulethu, Cape Town, burnt tyres and rubbish on some of parts of NY111, accusing their councillor of being a liar. Resident Nobuntu Buyani said last December, she received a call from the city informing her about a job. “I was told to keep my documents certified so that when they contact me for a cleaning job, I just submit them,” said Buyani. Another resident Bongiwe Phikelela said she quit her job after also receiving a similar call. “I was working at a farm, but I quit after the call because we worked so hard there. I was shocked to find out that people were hired while we were still waiting for them to confirm where we should start working,” added Phikelela. Another resident Andiswa Siswana said the people who were working were employed by the councillor and his committee. “Our councillor is a liar. We asked why they employed other people instead of those the city had called, and he said the city was just checking if our contact numbers were working or not,” said Siswana. She added that they knew it was a lie. “We are being taken for fools, and we know that the people who were employed will give the committee members R500 per month. But we won’t stop fighting because we know we were supposed to be employed to clean the streets,” added Siswana. Ward 40 ANC councillor Bongani Ngcombolo said there was no truth to what the residents were saying. “I have never said the city was checking if their contact details were working or not. Why would I say that?” he asked, adding that people were employed by the database. Additionally, Ngcombolo said the hired people were being employed for the first time. “The problem is that some people do not want to give others a chance to work. They know that after a while, contracts expire and new people are then given a chance. But they don’t want that. Instead, they decided to protest.” The City of Cape Town said it would make efforts to investigate the matter.
