CCTV footage of thugs stealing cars from a dealership has surfaced. According to CBS 2 Chicago, the thieves arrived at the dealership in a stolen Honda CR-V and rapidly made their way to the service door. Following that, seven people emerged from the Honda and broke one of the windows to gain access to the building and then they searched for the lockbox holding several keys. With the keys in hand, the thieves were able to drive off with a handful of cars. Itâ€™s not clear how many cars were taken, but the station reported that six cars were either stolen or damaged.
