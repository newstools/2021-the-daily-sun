IN their spare time, Mamelodi Sundowns players could do well to watch Manchester City in action. Without doubt, they can learn a thing or two from the English Premiership side on how to be ruthless in front of goal. Just as they dominated on the domestic front, the Brazilians took their Caf Champions League game against Al Hilal by the scruff of its neck at the weekend. But they could not reap enough rewards as they edged the Sudanese 2-0 in their Group B fixture at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. Not for the first time this season, coach Manqoba Mngqithi has lamented the lack of sharpness upfront, pointing to several matches in which his side couldn’t quite get their dues. “The game panned out the way we thought it would. But one still complains about the fact that we are not shrewd (ruthless) enough,” said Mngqithi. “But they will come right. Maybe the players were a bit nervous because you could see in some areas that the team (Al Hilal) is strong. It was always going to be a set-piece game, a second-ball game, which we dealt with better. But there’s still room for improvement.” At the risk of sounding like a stuck record, Mngqithi went on and bemoaned the missed opportunities in previous matches. He added: “The people who you’d expect to score from those chances, unfortunately, didn’t take them. “Yes, it’s a fact. We’ve been complaining about this. If you look at the game against Chippa we scored two, but we could have easily scored 8 or 10. “The Stellenbosch game turned into a humdinger, but we scored four more goals. We’ve not been clinical. Our goal ratio is not bad. “But if you look at the chances we create, we always look like a team that can score as many goals.” Mngqithi, however, is equally wary not to put “stress and cause anxiety” for the players. “The more you demand, the more you put them under tremendous pressure and they may end up not giving you what you want,” Mngqithi concluded.
