THE anticipated Mpumalanga cabinet reshuffle took place yesterday with four new MECs chosen. Rumours of a planned reshuffle surfaced in January after allegations of a planned vote of no confidence against Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane. The four new MECs include Speedy Mashilo for human settlements, Busisiwe Shiba for co-operative governance and traditional affairs, Vusi Mkhatshwa for finance, economic development and tourism and Mohita Latchminarain for public works, roads and transport. Vusi Shongwe has been moved to community safety, security and liaison, Thandi Shongwe to sport and recreation, Mandla Msibi to agriculture and Lindiwe Ntshalintshali will take over the social development department. Mtshweni-Tsipane said in May 2019, the people of Mpumalanga gave the provincial government an indication they wanted – the fight against poverty, inequality and unemployment sped up. PICS: MAKHI HAS US HOSTAGE! “This mandate has been exacerbated by the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic. If we are to be equal to this mandate, it is our responsibility to ensure the government is capable, efficient and can oversee the utilisation of public resources.” The premier said it was of the utmost importance that the government provided better services while improving the provincial economy. “I have decided to reconfigure the executive council, taking into account those who are committed to working hard and have integrity. “The new executive council reaffirms our commitment to advancing the development of capable female leaders, who will continue to make up 50% of the executive council,” she said. “Through our commitment to providing a platform for capable youth leadership, we have included a significant number of young people who we trust will infuse vibrancy and invigorate the functioning of the executive council.”
