SWALLOWS FC coach Brandon Truter is concerned that opposition teams have already figured out his system, which makes it more difficult to maintain their unbeaten run. His side face rejuvenated Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the Nedbank Cup last-16 round at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Friday (6pm). Swallows seem to be running out of air lately and their wings cannot carry them aloft any longer, having drawn five consecutive matches and nine overall in the DStv Premiership this season. Truter admitted that it’s now tough to get results with every game they play. “Tactically it’s becoming more difficult,” said the Birds coach. “But it’s nice as it makes us think outside the box to react in a certain way. “It doesn’t make you to be in a comfort zone. It’s tough because teams at the bottom are fighting for everything (points to survive). “TTM won three matches in a row, so we have to improve. I don’t expect it easier (to reach last eight) as we face a 15th placed team in a cup game.” Truter said his most difficult challenge is to keep his players grounded to focus on the job at hand instead of being big headed. “I have put the team first at all times,” he added. “I want the best for the club, but sometimes there are casualties. That’s why we have Bible study groups. They have carried us this far.” Truter said his recipe for success is that he is able to read opposition coaches mindset, which also benefitted his side in the GladAfrica Championship to gain automatic promotion.
