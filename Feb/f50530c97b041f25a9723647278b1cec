Nosipho Mthembu-Mapukata wants to spread the word of God to criminals. And she’s doing this through her music. The award-winning traditional gospel music singer said she started singing at the age of five at the Anglican Church. Nosipho started her music career in 2018 and is now preparing to release a single in March. The 48-year-old from Nquthu in KZN told Daily Sun she mixed the popular worship songs Ngicebile Kakhulu ,  Ngilonda Izwi Lakho ,  Ngiya Ekhaya ,  In Bright Mention  Above ,  Dwala Lensindiso  and   I’m Going Home  into one song.  “This is a time to be closer to God as Covid-19 is killing many people,” she told the SunTeam. “Death can come to me, but I’d be rich if it comes when I’m closer to my creator. “The song will also help many people get closer to their God when they sing it.” Nosipho released her debut album  Idwala Lensindiso  in 2018. The following year she released the single  Ufanelwe Ubukhosi, which scooped the Best National Award at the Mpumalanga Gospel Music Awards. Last year she released her second album,   Izigi Zenkosi. Nosipho, who is head of the firearms, liquor and second-hand goods control department at Springs Police Station, has been a cop for 20 years. She said although she’s a gospel singer, she’s strict when it comes to arresting the bad guys. “I don’t laugh. I make sure people don’t misuse their firearms and drink responsibly,” she said.
