ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has enticed their fans with a second trophy this season. Having bagged the MTN8 trophy at the start of the season, the German coach has made a bold statement that they have all the qualities to lift the Nedbank Cup. Their next last-16 fixture against Maritzburg United, Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday, is a must win if they are to progress to the quarter-final of the tournament. The German mentor says they can compete against any opponent that comes their way. Pirates last won the Ke Yona Cup during the 2013-14 season. Now, with the DStv Premiership title seemingly far from their reach, they are targeting Nedbank to complete a double this season. On Saturday, they visit Harry Gwala Stadium when they will face The Team of Choice at 6pm. "We remain confident," said Zinnbauer. “We have the self-belief, the squad and the quality of players we have are capable. We did well in the MTN8 where we kept advancing to the later rounds and did well in that competition where no one trusted us to win it. "We have a title now already, so now we'll try to do our best. We’ve improved in the CAF Champions League two legs and now we're focusing on this competition. We have to secure our passage to the next round.” Pirates remain without key players as the likes of Gabadinho Mhango, Terrence Dzvukamanja, Tshegofatso Mabasa and Zakhele Lepasa are all out due to injuries. On Saturday, they could be without the services of Thembinkosi Lorch and Thulani Hlatshwayo. Lorch was substituted in the 25th minute of the match with tight muscle when Pirates were held to a 1-1 draw by SuperSport United on Wednesday. However, the coach said they will soldier on with the available players. “We have more than eight players out and this is not easy, but we have to accept this and improve,” Zinnbauer said.
