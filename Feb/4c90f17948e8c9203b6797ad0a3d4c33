FIVE family members were seriously injured when their house burnt down in the early hours of yesterday. The incident happened in Huntington Village, near the Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga. Shocked neighbour Jetro Mkansi said he was woken by the smell of smoke, and when he went to investigate he saw his neighbour’s house burning. He shouted for help from other residents, but when they arrived at the house it was already covered in flames. “We called the firefighters, but by the time they arrived everything had already burnt,” he said. “We’re glad we saved the lives of our neighbours and we wish them a speedy recovery in hospital.” Bushbuckridge fire and rescue acting chief, Khensani Maduna, told the SunTeam firefighters were sent to the scene from Mkhuhlu station. “Upon arrival our members found the house was still burning, and they managed to battle the fire until they stopped it. “They rescued a vehicle parked inside the garage. Injured family members aged between five and 59 were rushed to hospital with serious injuries. “It’s suspected an electrical fault caused the fire, which started at an exploded meter box.” Maduna urged residents to make sure the wiring in their houses was done properly. “With the heavy rains currently being experienced, people should not attempt to cross low bridges over rivers. Bushbuckridge is surrounded by large rivers flowing towards the Kruger National Park,” she said.
