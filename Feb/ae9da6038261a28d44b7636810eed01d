Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane rejected Luis Miquissone three years ago and the decision came back to haunt him on Tuesday as a brilliant goal by the Mozambican gave Simba an upset 1-0 CAF Champions League victory. Miquissone moved left, then right on the edge of the 'D' before unleashing a thunderbolt that flew over Ahly captain and goalkeeper Mohamed el Shenawy into the net on 31 minutes. Tanzania have permitted spectators at football matches throughout the coronavirus pandemic and the estimated 30 000 crowd at the national stadium in Dar es Salaam rose to cheer a worthy match-winner. Miquissone joined Mamelodi Sundowns in 2018 when Mosimane was coach of the Pretoria outfit but failed to impress and was loaned to South African and Mozambican clubs before joining Simba last year.He is part of a multi-national Simba line-up, with five Tanzanians and one player each from the DR Congo, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia starting against Egyptian and African giants Ahly.Mosimane made history last September when he became the first sub-Saharan African to coach Ahly since the club was formed in 1907, and the loss to Simba was only his second since taking charge.The victory for Simba, coupled with V Club of DR Congo crushing Al Merrikh of Sudan 4-1 in Omdurman, has turned Group A into a three-club melting pot after just two matchdays.Simba lead with six points, V Club and title-holders Ahly have three each and pointless Merrikh appear out of contention for a top-two finish and a quarterfinals place after successive three-goal losses. -AFP
