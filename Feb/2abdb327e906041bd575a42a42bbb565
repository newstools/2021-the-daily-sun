ALTHOUGH Mzansi Magic’s Isibiya has been canned and replaced by upcoming telenovela Diepsloot, the show is doing well. According to the latest ratings statistics, Isibiya ranked number five on the top 10 most-watched shows on the DStv bouquet. This marked a first for the show as it had been struggling to reach the top 10, resulting on its demise. The latest figures showed that Isibaya had amassed more than two million viewers on the overall top 10. This was while it also ranked number three on the most-watched show on DStv’s catch-up. Nomsa Philiso, channel director for local entertainment channels at M-Net, recently confirmed to Daily Sun that the show had been canned. She added that while it was sad to see it coming to an end, she was excited for Diepsloot, produced by Black Brain Productions.
