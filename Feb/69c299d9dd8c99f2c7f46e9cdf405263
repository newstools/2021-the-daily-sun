POLICE have made the largest bust involving the illegal importation of medicine. Unregistered medicine worth R126 million was seized at OR Tambo International Airport from India. Police spokeswoman Colonel Athlenda Mathe said the bust was a major breakthrough, since the beginning of the year, in clamping down the illegal importation of unregistered medicine. The unregistered medicine, believed to be ivermectin, was mainly found to be in tablet form. Mathe said: “The discovery of the tablets was made earlier this week by authorities during an inspection of a cargo container that was destined to South Africa from India.” She said upon a compliance verification of the unregistered medicine by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, authorities found that the company that had imported the medicine into the country had done so without the necessary written approval and authorisation from the regulatory authority,” she said. “No arrests have been made as yet but the SAPS, through its interpol office, is working with authorities from India to establish the exact delivery address of the consignment,” she said. Last month, a multidisciplinary team arrested seven suspects for the illegal importation of unregistered medicine mostly found to be ivermectin. One person was arrested at King Shaka International Airport while six others were arrested at OR Tambo International Airport. Mathe said preliminary investigations revealed that the unregistered medicine had been imported for sale purposes, and would have been used as treatment for Covid-19.
