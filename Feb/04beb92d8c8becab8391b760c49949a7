THE Hawks will investigate cases that came out of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission from 1996 to 2003. It will also go as far as investigating matters that happened during apartheid, such as that of Ahmed Timol. This was announced by Deputy Police Minister Cassel Mathale during the handover of cars to the Hawks in Silverton, east of Tshwane, yesterday. “The directorate has recruited former police officers to capacitate it,” he said. “It recruited officers to help investigate matters from the TRC, Venda Building Society and Steinhoff.” Hawks head Advocate Godfrey Lebeya told Daily Sun they made several arrests towards the end of 2020 and, as a result, received messages of appreciation.

The Hawks worked closely with the NPA to ensure the cases were resolved speedily. “Some have used Covid-19 to steal and a number of arrests were made,” he said. “These vehicles will assist us very much and we’re grateful to government.  “We’ll accelerate delivery of services expected from us.” He said they’d be making arrests in the Eastern Cape soon. “We’re visiting two provinces on Thursday, 18 February on matters needing attention.”
