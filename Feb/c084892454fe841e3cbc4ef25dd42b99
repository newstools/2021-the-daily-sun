AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has been delighted with how well new signing Zukile Kewuti has settled into his new surroundings. The 26-year-old midfielder swapped Cape Town for KwaZulu-Natal in the latest transfer window, joining Usuthu from Cape Town City on a short-term loan. Kewuti is familiar, however, with McCarthy’s methods with the pair having worked together during their time at the Citizens. This is a huge boost for Kewuti who does not have much time to settle into the Usuthu environment, having joined mid-season. His debut appearance for the KZN outfit against Swallows FC in the past weekend left McCarthy very pleased with his latest addition. The former Citizens coach saw enough from Kewuti to suggest he will be one of the key players going forward this season, but also admitted that he might lack a bit of match fitness. “I’m very happy with what I saw from Zukile (Kewuti),” said McCarthy. “It’s not easy coming into a team that is in good form and on a good run. We must remember that he has not been playing consistently at Cape Town City, so he’s gonna run out of legs in the first few matches. “But I think he just makes us so solid in midfield. I’m very happy with his debut. And like I said, he is a player whom I like. I know the qualities he has and what he can bring to this team and he’s only going to get better with more game time. I’m positive about that.” McCarthy also heaped praise on youngster Samkelo Mgwazela, who was thrown in the deep end but showed immense maturity. Mgwazela was snapped up by Usuthu from KZN rivals Golden Arrows’ DStv Diski Challenge team and wasn’t expected to feature much for the first team. “Samkelo (Mgwazela) is just a breath of fresh air,” added McCarthy. “A young man but he’s so valiant, so brave. He gets thrown in the deep end and swims. I think we looked more dangerous when he came on.
