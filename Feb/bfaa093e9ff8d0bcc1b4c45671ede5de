Al AHLY coach Pitso Mosimane hardly finishes a press
briefing without talking about the potential of black African coaches to be
just as good as their European counterparts. At times, it comes out as rhetoric. But his achievements with his former Mamelodi Sundowns
and with current team reaffirms his conviction that nothing stops budding
Africans coach from living their dreams. One such coach who has heeded Mosimane’s advice his Young
Africans SC coach Cedric Kaze. Mosimane recently led the Egyptian giants Al Ahly to a
third-place finish at the 2020 Fifa Club World Cup in Qatar. He is the first South African to win a medal at a Fifa
world event, and the first non-Egyptian African to guide Ahly. “He is an inspiration to every African coach who is
working very hard to get to the highest football level in Africa and beyond,”
said Kaze. “He has taught us a very good lesson that if you work
hard, you can get anywhere. Now, an African coach is coaching the best club in
the world. “I believe that we, African coaches, put ourselves a
limit. In future, I want to reach a very good level. I know that it is going to
come by working very hard and taking opportunities when they come. But first I
should do well where I am.” The highly-rated Burundian coach aims to guide the
Tanzanian side into domestic and continental glory. “My ambition is to help Yanga reach the summit, to win
trophies and to go far in African competitions. I know I have the knowledge and
the ambition to succeed after that in North Africa and in the world.” Kaze, the Barcelona Academy and Germany-trained coach led
Yanga to top Tanzania league championship, having won a national cup last
month.
