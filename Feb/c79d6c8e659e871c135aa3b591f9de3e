TAPELO Xoki has quite a unique name. Apart from the fact that one is hardly ever going to meet Xhosa native with a Sotho name, Xoki spells his name differently. The unassuming AmaZulu defender shot to prominence after he banged in an astonishing freekick as Usuthu edged Bloemfontein Celtic in their thrilling DStv Premiership game on Tuesday. Xoki was christened Thapelo Nyongo. But that was before he changed his surname two years ago – and the name, Tapelo? “My mom named me Mthandazo, but she loved the Sotho version more. So, she named me Thapelo. It was the Home Affairs who messed up the spelling. She gave up on fixing the error a long time ago and so Tapelo stuck,” explained Xoki. The 25-year-old has played over 100 matches for AmaZulu, but it wasn’t until the remarkable freekick he scored that his name came up in football conversations. With the game destined for a 3-3 draw, Xoki lined up a freekick, took a few steps back before smashing into the top corner to hand Usuthu an incredible win. Benni McCarthy wheeled away “Clive Barker” style as he celebrated the winning goals. “The coach chooses designated penalty-takers before matches. Fortunately I was the first option on the list,” Xoki said. “The chips were down. We’d just conceded two goals and I had to back myself for that freekick. When the ball went in, I was overwhelmed with emotions. I nearly cried. “The way we celebrated, meant a lot. It would not have been the same if we were winning comfortably. “Some moments are to treasure. But I was glad we saved ourselves the embarrassment of drawing, having thrown away a two-goal lead. The backlash from the coach, phew! “For the spectators, it was a nice game to watch… with the drama. But for you, it says we’re doing everything right to be conceding goals.” Under McCarthy’s guidance, AmaZulu has shown notable improvements. They have recorded three successive wins and will go into their Nedbank Cup opener against Golden Arrows brimming with confidence this weekend.
