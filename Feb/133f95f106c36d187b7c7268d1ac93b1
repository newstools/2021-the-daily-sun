SIMON WAS rushed to hospital in great pain caused by massive
burns all over his body. But while he’s no longer in hospital, his pain is worse than
ever. SIMON’S BALLS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND HIS 4-5 HAS STOPPED
WORKING! Simon Marumo (42) from Winterveldt, Tshwane, said he went to
George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa after he got burnt by a paraffin stove while cooking, injuring his face and chest. He didn’t think not having balls was a problem because he thought it was the medication. “I stayed in hospital for almost three months and didn’t notice my 4-5 had stopped working,” he said. When he got home in December he realised he couldn’t get an erection when he was with his girlfriend. “I tried for days, but it wouldn’t work so I went back to hospital,” he said. He wondered why they hadn’t told him this before. He noticed his right leg wasn’t working properly, either. “My girlfriend has dumped me because I’m depressed all the time and she couldn’t take it anymore,” he said. The former taxi driver blamed the hospital for his suffering. His ex, Martha Sithole (29), said she left Simon because his bad temper had made things difficult for her. “I needed to give him space to deal with his 4-5 issue,” she said.
