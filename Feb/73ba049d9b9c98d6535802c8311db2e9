ORLANDO Pirates could face Mamelodi Sundowns or Polokwane City in the quarter-finals of the Nedbank Cup. The Ke Yona draw, which took place in Port Elizabeth on Sunday, served up this potential humdinger. Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandla, who broke Swallows FC’s unbeaten run, will face Black Leopards in a Limpopo derby. Meanwhile, Chippa United will host Richards Bay at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. The Chilli Boys proved too hot for Cape Town City, walking away 2-1 winner in the last-16. Bienvenu Eva Nga came off the bench to score the winner and send his side into the quarter-finals of the Ke Yona Cup. Augustine Chidi Kwem had given Chippa the lead but it was cancelled out by his compatriot Abdul Jaleel Ajagun on debut. The match was destined for the lottery of penalty shootouts but Nga had other ideas as he popped up with the winner to break City’s hearts. Chippa, who progressed to the last 16 with a 4-3 penalty shoot-out victory over GladAfrica Championship side Free State Stars at home, will now look to go deep in the competition. Kwem opened the scoring in the first half but the Chilli Boys could not hold on to their lead as the Citizens came roaring back in the second half. Ajagun, the 28-year-old former Panathinaikos attacking midfielder, came on to equalize for City. Unfortunately, he could not finish the game due to injury and would later be replaced by Thamsanqa Mkhize. The two sides kept going at each other as they went searching for the winner but it would not arrive for either team. Chippa had to wait until extra time to snatch the match through Nga’s heroics. The two sides will resume their battle when they face each other again in a DStv Premiership clash at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Wednesday (3 pm).
