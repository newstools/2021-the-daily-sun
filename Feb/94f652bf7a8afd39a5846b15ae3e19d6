SESI Makhanya (37) has to use a ladder to get in and out of her yard. Their house is enclosed by their neighbours’ walls. The family from Small Farms in Evaton, Vaal said they feel like prisoners in their own home. Their torture has been going on for more than a year now and they say the Emfuleni Municipality is not willing to fix it.

She said her mother, Angelina Makhanya (69), is stuck because she can’t climb the wall. “Luckily she doesn’t have chronic diseases. If she had to go to hospital she’ll just die,” said Sesi. “Our relatives hardly visit because of the wall and when they do, they have to leave their cars outside which is dangerous,” said Sesi. She lives with her mum, her two kids, her younger brother and her cousin.  Neighbour Amelia Ntsoebea told Daily Sun she’ll allow the family to climb the wall and pass through her yard. “I feel sorry for them. I can’t make a door for them because the space is too small,” said Amelia. Sesi said 10 municipal officials have visited the house, but they didn’t enter because they couldn’t jump the wall. Daily Sun spoke to another neighbour who said he bought the site and didn’t want to say anything further. Sesi said it used to be a park where some of the neighbours had built their houses.

She said Emfuleni’s MMC for Human Settlement Edwin Kele visited them last Thursday 18 February and he promised to come back, but didn’t. Kele said they were trying to solve the matter. He said if the neighbours who built their houses followed the old town council plan, they will have to negotiate with them to open a way for the family “I’ve sent my team to go investigate the servitudes. We’ll check if the neighbour’s plans were approved by the municipality and if not, they will face the consequences.”
