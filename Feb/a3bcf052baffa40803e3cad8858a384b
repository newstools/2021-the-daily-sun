Phelo Bala received a spiritual calling in 2014 and he accepted it. At the time he said his body had stopped working before he was told to see a traditional healer, who revealed to him that he should follow his calling of becoming a sangoma. Speaking to Drum, he said: “I’m a sangoma. Music is not my calling and I will not do it forever. Whether I have healed people through music or in my sangoma practices, my calling is healing.” Kwaito star L’vovo Derrango, in an interview with Daily Sun, said: “I don’t want to be a sangoma. I am a musician. That’s all. I wouldn’t ignore this calling, as I respect my culture and religion.” A post shared by Masechaba Khumalo (@masechabandlovu)
