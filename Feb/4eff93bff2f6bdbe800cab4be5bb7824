JOSEF Zinnbauer has defended his selection criteria, explaining injuries have influenced his decisions. The Orlando Pirates coach has been criticised for fiddling with his starting line-up, although results have improved in recent games. It is safe to say Zinnbauer will make changes for the Caf Confederation Cup assignment this weekend. “I know there are supporters who are saying why is the coach always changing his team or why is he not fielding players in the right position?” said Zinnbauer. “Like against Cape Town City on Tuesday we played Ndlovu as a right-back because the other full-backs are out. Three full-backs are all injured. Those are the things you have to manage as a coach, so I understand the supporters. It’s not easy. Now we have played 10 or 11 games in 30 days and it’s a lot for players. But you have to find a new structure like Hotto (Deon), he played as a number nine yet he is not a nine.” The Buccaneers head to Gaborone for their Confederation Cup play-off first leg tie against Jwaneng Galaxy on Sunday. No doubt the biggest concern for Zinnbauer is the inability of his boys to finish off the plenty of chances upfront. He was left frustrated by the poor finishing against City, despite their 2-0 win. “It was a top performance, a team effort, it was an important win for us. “But I was a little disappointed with the chances that we had, at the end of the day you know how football can be, they can get a goal,” added Zinnbauer. Jwaneng are not expected to offer much resistance against Bucs, as they went down to Mamelodi Sundowns in their last Caf outing. But the lack of decisiveness upfront may prove to be Pirates’ Achilles heel if the malaise is not addressed.
