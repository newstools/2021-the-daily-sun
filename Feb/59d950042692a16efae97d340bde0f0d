RESIDENTS of Odinburg in Mabopane, north of Tshwane, were shocked by the discovery of a naked woman’s body in the river on Tuesday. The woman’s underwear was around her thighs. According to residents, the body was found by a passerby and they called the police. Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairwoman Rose Khutswane said they have been dealing with gender-based violence and it hurt to witness such things. “Women and kids get killed every day and we are fighting it. We want to know who is this woman’s killer,” she said. Another CPF member, Agnes Lengwati, said the river in which the woman was found is surrounded by a bush and sewage. “This place is not safe and people cross here when they go to work and school. We have been complaining about this bush for a long time. It’s time something is done about it,” she said. Residents said they were worried who the woman was. Residents said they can’t identify her because the police said her body was damaged. They said police told them she has a tattoo on her wrist saying “Tumelo”. They said they were scared more people might be thrown in the river. Captain Mavela Masondo said the police have opened an inquest docket for further investigation. “The body will be sent for a post-mortem to determine the cause of death. “Police appeal to anyone who might have information that can help in the investigation to call the nearest police station or Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” he said.
