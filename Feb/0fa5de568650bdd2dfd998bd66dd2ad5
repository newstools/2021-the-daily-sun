HE was walking home on the evening of 2 February when two men came out of nowhere. Armed with guns, knives, scissors and a hammer, the men demanded money from Joseph Derembwe. BUT ALL HE HAD WAS A 2KG BAG OF WASHING POWDER AND R100 IN HIS POCKET. READ: 'SANGOMA TOOK MY MILLIONS!' Although Joseph co-operated with the men and gave them what he had, they still attacked him. The 37-year-old from Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, was then tortured the entire night and left to die. “They told me they wanted to make me blind and kill me,” he said. Joseph said he was tortured with a hammer and knives.  He tried to scream for help, but no one heard him as he and his attackers were in the bushes. “They were having fun torturing me. I was in so much pain I wanted to die right there. “I lost consciousness after they stabbed me in the eyes with scissors.” ALSO READ: UZALO BRINGS BACK THE BIG GUNS! Joseph said the men were gone when he regained consciousness, but he couldn’t see properly. A passer-by found him and called an ambulance. “I spent eight days in hospital and now I can’t see in my right eye. I experienced hell and it’s a miracle I’m still alive,” he said. His wife, Loraine Matusa (39), said the police failed them. “The police have not found the thugs. They haven’t even taken a statement from Joseph,” she said. Captain Mathews Nkoadi was aware of the matter and would attend to it.
