Mamelodi Sundowns star Gaston Sirino is a big family man. The Uruguayan international ensures that he spends almost every minute of his spare time with his loved ones whenever he gets the chance. As a professional footballer, Sirino has a tight schedule. And given he plays for Sundowns, who are constantly travelling and playing a lot of games across numerous competitions and cnountries, Sirino does not have much time in his hands. So the diminutive midfielder dedicates the little time that he gets in between to his family. He can be seen on social media engaging in a number of fun activities with his partner Melania and their children. Among other activities, the Sirinos enjoy quad biking and exploring some of the wildlife Mzansi has to offer. They also like to gather and enjoy a braai together.
