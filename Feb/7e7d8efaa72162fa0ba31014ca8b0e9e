SOPHIE Mokoena, foreign editor at the SABC, got tongues wagging on Twitter when she gave a jab to politicians about stomach politics. She tweeted on Saturday, 13 February: “Politics of the stomach are so dangerous. There are politicians who are just not principled nje.” Politics of the stomach are so dangerous. There are politicians who are just not principled nje.  Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula didn’t take this lightly, responding by tweeting: “If you speak about stomach politics, I’ll give [a] lecture about you.” If You speak about stomach politics ill give lecture about you.  EFF leader Julius Malema, who also got hungry to tweet, came to Sophie’s defence: “He banna, why are you threatening our aunt now?” He banna, why are you threatening our Aunt now?  Mbalula then tweeted: “I differed with my principal while serving him and under him.” But Twitter user Omphemetse couldn’t resist to join the feast of words: “Literally why she said politics of the stomach then a ‘stomach politician’ responded, yuuu.” Literally whe she said politics of the stomach then a "stomach politician" responded yuuu????????
