NURSE: ASIFUNI iVACCINE! “We were happy that we’d be getting a comfortable house like our neighbours.” The project is aimed at rebuilding dilapidated hoouses built before 1994. They were told to find an alternative place while construction was under way. She and her son moved into outside rooms within the yard, and the house was demolished and electricity cut off. “They took cables with them. They left the house unfinished, but we didn’t mind as we thought it was temporary,” she said. “But they stopped construction in April last year.”  She still cooks on a fire outside and they buy candles daily. “We spent Christmas in the dark,” she said. “I’ve tried several times to speak to the councillor, but he won’t help me. He tells me to wait yet other houses have been finished.” Councillor Nhlanhla Shezi told Daily Sun: “The delay was caused by lockdown. “Houses that were demolished and partially rebuilt will be completed soon.”
