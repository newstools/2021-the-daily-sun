The Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg has postponed sentencing against former Ekurhuleni Metro Police Superintendent Adam Cummings, and his co-accused Tebogo Maregele.  Cummings was found guilty on three counts of rape and one of human trafficking, while Maregele was convicted as an accomplice to the rape of a nine-year-old and two counts of exploitation of children for financial gain. According to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), Cummings paid Maregele to lure young girls from Soweto, between the ages of eight and 15.  The case was postponed because a lawyer representing Cummings and Maregele was not present in court. The matter was investigated by IPID. The trial against Cummings and Maregele began onÂ 18 June 2018 and they were found guilty on 20 May 2019. IPID spokesperson Ndileka Cola said the two have been changing lawyers, thus delaying the sentencing procedure. IPID anticipates the sentence against the two will send a strong message to others who continue to commit similar crimes.
