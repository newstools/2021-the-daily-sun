KAIZER Chiefs players appear to be serious about life after football. Unlike many of their peers who usually have nothing to fall back on after their playing days are over, these Amakhosi stars are securing their future. Chiefs utility player Bernard Parker has followed goalkeeper Brylon Petersen in obtaining a qualification. Petersen was the talk of social media when he recently bagged his degree in BSc Engineering (Mechanical) from Wits. And now his teammate Parker has followed suit with his Higher Certificate in Marketing with a Specialisation in Sport from Boston City Campus. Just like Petersen a few days ago, Parker has received a personalised congratulatory message from Chiefs on Twitter.
