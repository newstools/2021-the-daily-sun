PHILLIP Chiyangwa can walk the talk! The Cosafa president, the Caf presidential race kingmaker, is leading the regional campaign to get Patrice Motsepe elected as the eighth president of Caf in the 12 March polls. He certainly knows all about the campaign wheeling and dealing, having helped put incumbent Ahmad Ahmad in office four years ago. And he is prepared to for the presidential battle...even if it means playing dirty. “As Cosafa, we state our unequivocal support for Patrice Motsepe. I'm looking at upwards of 35 votes in the elections,” said Chiyangwa, who flanked Motsepe when the latter unveiled his manifesto in Joburg on Thursday. “A comparative analysis with the other candidates, with respect to what they have achieved in their personal lives, shows Motsepe is the right man. “If they go dirty, we go dirty. If they go smart, we go smart.” Motsepe outlined his plan, which hinges on a “Caf 10-point action plan”, emphasising the need for the private sector to invest in football.
