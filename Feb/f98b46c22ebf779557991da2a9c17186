Health 
Minister Zweli Mkhize has reiterated that Covid-19 vaccines will be safe
 to administer to people to protect them from the virus.  Mkhize briefed Parliament’s health portfolio committee on Friday. “The
 vaccines would have gone through a rigorous testing and analysis that 
would have proved its level of safety,” Mkhize told MPs.  The 
Health minister’s briefing comes after the arrival of one million doses 
of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine from India on Monday.   Mkhize said government are in the process of contracting major developers to provide vaccines. The Russian and Chinese vaccines are also being considered. Available There
 is, however, a shortfall of around 38 million doses of vaccines, but 
Mkhize says this shortfall will be made up as and when vaccines become 
available.    “There
 are many variations of conditions. The vaccine shows various efficacy, 
depending on various conditions. Largely the vaccine we are bringing 
(in) is safe. For any other individual there well may be certain 
responses or reaction that will come from the body. On their own, it 
does not mean the vaccines are unsafe,” Mkhize said.  With just 
days before the Covid-19 vaccine will be administered to healthcare 
workers, provincial governments are continuing to present roll-out 
strategies that are still thin on details.  Mkhize said the current issues around distribution will be addressed with provincial health departments. He has also called on community leaders to help government “We
 should not send fear out into the public about our vaccines. Let’s 
rather send clear messages on the vaccines. If there are any issues 
around corruption, lets talk about it,” he said. News24
