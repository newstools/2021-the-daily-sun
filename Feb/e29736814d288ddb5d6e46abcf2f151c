THE pain from Siphiwe’s toes is going straight to his heart. “Since December I’m struggling to sleep because of this unbearable pain,” Siphiwe Kgasago (35) from Lusaka in Mamelodi East, Tshwane told Daily Sun. “I’m appealing to izangoma and prophets or anyone else to help heal me.” He said he has been in hospital, but there has been no change. “It feels as if something is eating my toes. I’m rotting alive. I need urgent help to save my foot,” he said. He said his five toes are itching and when he scratches the pain becomes too much. He said his big toe began to itch and days later all the toes were itching and then it started aching. Siphiwe said he has not been able to work and even walking has become impossible. “I survive by washing cars and cleaning schools, but I haven’t been able to do anything since the beginning of the year,” he said. He said what worries him most is if his toes don’t get healed, he might lose his leg. Traditional healer Majoko Hlongwane said the man could die if he doesn’t get urgent treatment. She said someone is jealous of his work and bewitching him. “I can help him to remove that insect which is making his leg rot,” she said.
