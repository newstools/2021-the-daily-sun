NYANGA residents in Cape Town are shocked after two men were killed in a hail of bullets on Friday, 5 February. The shooters ambushed them near a shisa nyama close to Zolani centre. When their car passed near the shisa nyama, three men opened fire, targeting the driver’s side. The Toyota Etios the victims were driving then veered off the road, plunging into nearby eateries. Vendors in the area were still shocked following the killings. They suspected that the killers were sent to kill the driver.   “They fired several shots, with more than 20 targeting the driver’s side. When the car plunged into the shisa nyama spots on the side of the road, two killers went to open the door to make sure that everyone in the car was dead. They opened fire again at close range before speeding off,” said vendor Zola Mpesheni. Another vendor said 17 bullet cartridges were scattered on the road after the incident. When cops arrived, the killers had already fled the scene. “We have witnessed shootings on this street on different occasions, but this one was gruesome. I think the passenger was not the target. The killers just wanted to make sure they destroyed the evidence, hence they killed him,” said the vendor who did not want to be named. Cops spokesman Colonel André Traut confirmed the incident. “This afternoon at 4.50pm, two men aged 40 and 52 were shot and killed in their Toyota Etios in 6th Ave Nyanga. They were killed by unknown gunmen who are yet to be arrested. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.”
