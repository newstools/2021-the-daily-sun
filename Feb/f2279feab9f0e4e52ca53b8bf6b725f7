MEDIA personality Khanya “Kyeezi” Siyengo is grateful for his humble beginnings. The radio presenter, who currently hosts Metro FM’s chart show Metro FM Top 40 and Good Hope FM’s drive time show, The Great Drive, recently moved into a luxury apartment and he’s grateful to have a roof over his head. Speaking about his journey, Khanya told Daily Sun that people should never underestimate having their own space. “Because of the burning passion that I had for the entertainment industry, I left my job at a bank in 2013 to follow my passion and because my big break took longer than I expected, I found myself homeless. “I used to sleep in radio station studios and for a good year I slept on a friend’s couch. That’s where I learnt that having your own space where you can gather yourself and better yourself is important,” he said. Khanya, who has since been able to pull himself together, said he’s grateful to his friends for all the support. “My friends are the ones who believed in me and kept me alive. I’m thankful to them for believing in me and for their support,” he said. “My journey in the entertainment industry has been fulfilling. It’s better than what I imagined it to be. I’m glad it took longer to blossom because I’m more mature now,” he said. “Right now I’m in the process of releasing my mixtapes that I’ve been working on since we are under restrictions and we can’t gig.”
