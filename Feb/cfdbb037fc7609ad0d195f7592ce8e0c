 ORLANDO Pirates were made to sweat on their way to the Nedbank Cup last-16 by Uthongathi FC. The Buccaneers defeated the GladAfrica Championship side 1-0 in the last-32 of the Ke Yona Cup at Orlando Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Gabadinho Mhango's solitary strike on the 63rd minute proved to be enough to send the 2013-14 champions to the next round. Pirates were the first side to test the visitors goalkeeper Xolani Ngcobo in the early stages of the match through Deon Hotto's set-piece which forced Uthongathi keeper to parry for a corner-kick. As the match progresses in the first-half Uthongathi grew stronger however, both teams were unable to find the back of the net and went to the half-time break tied on 0-0. In the second half, both teams continued with their search of a goal andPirates were rewarded in the 63rd minute when Hotto brought down a ball over the top to play a low cross for Mhango who made no mistake to punish The Cane Cutters. Thabiso Sesane made his Pirates debut starting in defence alongside captain Happy Jele, Thulani Hlatshwayo and Innocent Maela. Jozef Zinnbauer's side could have got more goals but Jean-Marc Makusu Mundele who was introduced in the second half was not clinical enough as he couldn't bury the chances he got towards the end of the game. Goalkeeper Siyabonga Mpontshane was also given a rare chance in the second half as he came in to replace Richard Ofori. Pirates joined Mamelodi Sundowns, Polokwane City, Cape Town All Stars, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Pretoria Callies who have secured their place in the last-16.
