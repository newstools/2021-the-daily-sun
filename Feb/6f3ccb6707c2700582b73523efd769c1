WHILE growing up, I used to hate taking medicine and often would prefer fizzy and sweet drinks. My parents would often struggle to give me medication when I was sick as I despised taking medication. Despite me needing the medication, I would refuse to consume it and my parents often had to be creative when giving me medication. This analogy can be likened to a recent study that revealed that we consume more alcohol than water. Despite our bodies needing a certain amount of water, we drink less of it and more of the bev. According to experts, alcohol contains similar concentrations of sugar and salt as the human body and is therefore processed faster. Drinking a quart or litre of water in one go is roughly half of a minimum amount needed for a day, and a good bit to process through digestion. Physically it’s not a problem to try to drink two litres of water relatively quickly, even though that takes up lots of space in your stomach, and not everyone can consume that amount of water at one go. Three beers works out to more than 1 litre, a bit more than that quart, and a six-pack to 2 litres. Basically, it’s not normal to drink two quarts / litres of water that quickly.
