POWERFUL cars require driving skills and care, but many owners lack the skills. The Porsche Taycan is arguably one of the fastest accelerating electric cars on the market. Now, this rapid acceleration and instant power got one driver into trouble when he crashed the R2,7 million car. In the video, the driver can be seen sitting in the middle of the road getting ready to use its launch control system. He then accelerated the car to 188 km/h, but it appears he didnâ€™t see a large traffic circle in front of him. He left putting his foot on the brake too late and the car understeered when trying to negotiate the circle. With no time to correct the understeer, the car crashed into the grassy area in the centre of the traffic circle.
