COMPANIES that did the #JerusalemaChallenge for their own benefit are in hot water. This comes after Master KG’s label Open Mic Productions took action against them. The #JerusalemaChallenge took the world by storm last year, with people and companies around the world taking part. However, some people used it to promote their businesses. Open Mic entertainment lawyer Dumisani Motsamai explained how using the #JerusalemaChallenge for your own benefit could be a problem. “When a company advertises their product, they approach the person who owns the masters and the composer of the song to ask to use the song. “There’s what we call a composition right for the composer and a masters right for the company.

Dumisani said some companies didn’t clear Jerusalema and that is why they were in trouble. “When it comes to this challenge, there are people who became clever. “Instead of doing the challenge and dancing, they used the song in the background and showed us their companies. “They used it to advertise their brands. In that particular instance, we have to ask them to pay us,” he said. “What they did is called synchronisation. They took a song and synchronised it in a moving picture. “Then they put the end result on social media and showed people things that had nothing to do with the challenge. We’d be doing an injustice to Master KG and Nomcebo if we don’t collect those synchronisation royalties.” But Dumisani said they didn’t want people to stop taking part in the challenge.
