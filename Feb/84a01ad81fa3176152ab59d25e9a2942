RESIDENTS used to wonder why the car was parked next their houses almost every day. On Thursday, 4 February, they got the answers because the belonged to thugs who came to rob a nearby spaza. At about 11pm, they heard gunshots ringing in the air. Some bravely peeped through windows to see what was happening and saw thugs using the same car exchanging fire with the police. But it ended in tears for the thugs as two of them are in hospital and one is behind bars. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said two cops who were patrolling in Slovo, Springs cornered them. “Three suspects wearing masks armed with one 9mm star firearm tried to rob a shop owner. They waited for him to get out of his shop and pointed him with a gun to demand cash in his possession. The shop owner ran away with the cash and the suspects chased him and cornered him at Ghana Street where they assaulted and shot him. He fell to the ground and sustained head injuries. A member of the community witnessed the incident and informed police who were passing by about the robbery taking place. The detectives acted swiftly and confronted the suspects but they started shooting at them and they retaliated. Two suspects injured and the third suspect was apprehended,” he said.  Captain Makhubele said on further investigations it was established the suspects were driving a white Ford Fiesta with a false registration number. The money was recovered and the victim and the two suspects were transported to Pholosong Hospital for medical treatment. The third suspect is detained at Springs Police Station. “Cases of armed robbery, attempted murder and possession of a unlincesed firearm was opened against the suspects for further investigation.” Both suspects are under police guard.
