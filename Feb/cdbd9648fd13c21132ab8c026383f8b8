WHETHER it’s structured in bars, arranged in instruments or makes your ligaments move, music has the greatest power to evoke all human senses and feelings. We’ve often heard powerful stories on how music awakened someone from a coma, and this proves the power of music. According to experts, here are some benefits that comes with listening to music: 1. Music makes you happier Your brain releases a “happy hormone”, dopamine when you listen to music as neuroscientist, as discovered in the study, “The neuroscience of musical chill” by The Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. 2. Music enhances running performance Runners who listened to fast or slow motivational music completed the first 800 metres of their run faster than those who listened to calm music or ran without. 3. Music lowers stress and improves health Listening to music can decrease levels of the stress hormone, cortisol. A study showed that people’s immune systems were boosted when they actively participated in making music by playing various percussion instruments and singing.
