TS GALAXY striker Mxolisi Macuphu has heaped praise on new coach Owen Da Gama for the impact he has made since joining TheRockets. Da Gama found the Mpumalanga club flirting with danger under then coach Dan Malesela, in the relegation zone, but has quickly turned things around. The former Highlands Park coach has instilled the belief in the Galaxy team that looked out of sorts before his arrival. Macuphu has also credited Da Gama for helping him regain his scoring touch after he ended his mini drought against Black Leopards. He insists that the faith Da Gama showed in him even when the goals were not coming gave him a lot of confidence. The former Bidvest Wits marksman has scored four goals and provided two assists for The Rockets this season. He is hoping to reach double figures in goals this season. “As a striker, you will be judged on the number of goals you score,” said Macuphu. “But for me, it takes a special coach to look deeper and see what other contributions a striker brings to the team. “The effort has always been there. I have been working hard and assisting for goals when I have not been scoring. “As an experienced player, I know that form is temporary and it’s the mental strength that keeps me going during those tough periods. The coach has been instrumental in our form as a team. He has reminded us that we are a good team.” The Rockets will this weekend switch focus to a competition they enjoy playing in, which is the Nedbank Cup. They have good memories in the competition, having won it back in 2019 after pulling off one of the biggest shocks in Mzansi football when they beat Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 in the final. The Rockets face GladAfrica Championship outfit TS Sporting in the last 32 of the competition at Emirates Airline Park on Saturday.
