MOSA Lebusa has admitted to having felt “frustrated” at Mamelodi Sundowns early this season, with niggling injuries preventing him from seeing the regular game time. The 28-year-old centre-back missed out on Sundowns' first 10 league games. He recently returned and has made five appearances, helping the club maintain their unbeaten run in the DStv Premiership this season. "It took me about three months to make my first start as I was out, and that was frustrating for me,” Lebusa said. “The team was doing well if you remember, there was a time when the team went about five games without conceding and as a defender there was no chance for one to come in as the guys were doing well. “The injuries were also not giving me a chance. It was frustrating at times, but I was happy the team was doing well. "The teams have seen what we are about and every team we play wants to beat us and that makes the games a bit more difficult." The Tshwane outfit has conceded only seven goals in 15 games in the league, and Lebusa has given credit to the entire team and not only defenders. He said: “It is more of a collective thing that we do as a team, so I would not say it is only the defence but the whole team." "I would not say it is not only the defence that must get credit if you look at the way we play we press from the top. The guys up front are the ones that initiate the press, the whole team is doing the defensive work.” Sundowns will be hoping to continue with their rich vein of form on Saturday as they kick-off their Caf Champions League campaign. The Brazilians will take on Al Hilal of Sudan at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday (6pm), in their first group stage encounter of the campaign. The Sudanese outfit earned their spot in Group B after knocking out Vipers FC of Uganda and Asante Kotoko of Ghana.
