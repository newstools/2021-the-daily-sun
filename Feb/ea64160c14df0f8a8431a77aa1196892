 AWARD-WINNING singer King Monada and former Thobela FM presenter, Kwenisto Makgakga, have smoked the peace pipe. The beef between the two started in 2018 when Kwenisto was accused of making sure King Monada’s Malwedhe didn’t win the radio station’s Song of the Year competition. It was alleged the winner was changed from Malwedhe to Master KG’s Skeleton Move. Kwenisto and his then producer Alpheus “DJ Boeli” Mailula were accused of interfering with the results. Kwenisto said he was inspired by former president Jacob Zuma and EFF leader Julius Malema to meet Monada for tea. The two met on Sunday and made peace. Speaking to Daily Sun, Kwenisto said he was more than happy that everything had been sorted out between him and Monada. “Saying I’m happy would be an understatement. I’m over the moon. “We spoke about everything and ironed everything out. “Tears were shed and we went deeper into the conversation than we had planned,” he said. “Besides being inspired by former president Zuma and Mr Malema’s meeting, I had always wanted to do this. I don’t like tension. This is why I reached out to Monada.” Monada wasn’t available for comment but his manager, Albert Makwela said: “We had nothing against Kwenisto. It’s our fans that had a problem and accused him of robbing Monada. We agreed to meet with him because we never accused him of anything,” he said. “We’re happy to have sat down with him. At the end of the day, we’re all from Limpopo and we cannot hold grudges.”
