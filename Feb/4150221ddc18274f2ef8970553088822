MEC of Health in the Western Cape Nomafrench Mbombo said she was worried about the possibility of a third Covid-19 wave and its possible effects on health workers. Mbombo said the second wave had killed and infected more health workers than the first one. “We are concerned as everyone is talking about the possibility of a third wave. We don’t know how it will be and when, but it is anticipated around May or June,” said Mbombo. She said the delay in the roll-out of vaccines would expose more health workers to the virus. “As we witnessed in December, the second wave hit the health system and workers the hardest. I have never seen a number of healthcare workers who were infected and died in any other month than December,” said Mbombo. She said no one knew what the impact of the third wave might have on the system, and believed that a swift roll-out of the vaccine served healthcare workers. Department spokesperson Mark van der Heever said the department lost a total of 114 healthcare workers since the beginning of the lockdown, and from this number, 46 died in December alone. He said this included all healthcare workers, not just doctors and nurses. The cumulative number of healthcare workers who tested positive since March last year was sitting at 8 700, but 1 917 of these were recorded in December alone. Besides the impact on the system, Mbombo said the vaccine would help open up the economy. “I’m concerned that without a vaccine, the opening of the economy becomes challenging. It is difficult for investors coming in. The Emirates has even banned South African travellers because of the new variant,” she added.
