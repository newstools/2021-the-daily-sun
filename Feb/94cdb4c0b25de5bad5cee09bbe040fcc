SOMEONE tried to break into her house in the early hours of Saturday morning. She screamed and the suspect ran away. The woman then received a call from a private number 30 minutes later and the callers told her they saw the suspect run out of her yard. The fake cops claimed they gave chase, but the suspect ran away. They then told her they were coming to take a statement from her. But she was surprised when one of the cops produced a gun, told her to lie down and they both made off with her TV and cellphone. However, she managed to get their car registration and the two fake cops were bust. Cops have now warned people to be vigilant of new tactics used by criminals. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu said the victim received an unidentified call at 4.15am from an unknown woman who introduced herself as a cop. “They claimed they were patrolling past the victim’s house when they saw someone run out of her yard. They tried to give chase without any success. “The woman said the fake cops told her they wanted to help her open a case and to make sure everything is in order for the investigation to resume,” said Mngomezulu. The victim allowed the woman and the man she was with into the house and while the woman pretended to take a statement from her, the man suddenly instructed her to lie down at gun point. They then robbed her of her plasma TV and cellphone. The two suspects, aged 29 and 31, fled in a Polo Vivo.
