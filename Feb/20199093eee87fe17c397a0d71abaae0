AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has opened up on why Phakamani Mahlambi is not playing regularly since he arrived at the club. The former Bafana Bafana striker explained that Mahlambi, who is on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns, is not working hard enough at training. Ironically, Mahlambi was likened by Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt as the new Benni McCarthy when both were previously at Bidvest Wits, but Mahlambi has yet to live up to McCarthy’s demands. “I’m not a person who has anything against anyone,” said McCarthy. “I think players have to impress themselves. If you have talent in abundance, you have to match that with hard work. If I don’t see players giving me what I’m looking for and there are players who are sweating blood and tears, then I’ll go with the latter.” McCarthy said he doesn’t expect Siphelele “Shaka Zulu” Mthembu to bang in the goals, but is happy for him as he continues being a team player, play an all-round role up front to hold the ball and lay it off for attackers to benefit. The former Orlando Pirates and Chiefs striker is not one of the top finishers in the PSL, but his presence gives opponents sleepless nights. Mthembu played a leading role in AmaZulu’s first goal netted by Augustine Mulenga in their 2-1 PSL win against Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Wednesday. Lehlohonolo Majoro scored a late winner. “Shaka is one of the best team players you can find in the PSL,” added McCarthy who worked with Mthembu at Cape Town City when they won the MTN8 in 2018. “I think people don’t give enough credit for the hard work he does. “People criticise him but they don’t understand what he brings to the team. But I don’t really care what the outside world says. “When he’s on the pitch, I know what we are going to get and 99% (of the time) we come away victorious when Shaka plays.”
