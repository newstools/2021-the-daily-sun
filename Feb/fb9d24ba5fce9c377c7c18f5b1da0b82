BANYANA Banyana striker Thembi Kgatlana has continued to establish her presence in the Primera División in Spain. Kgatlana joined the Spanish outfit from Portuguese Liga BPI side SL Benfica on a one-year deal in July last year, with an option to extend. Since she arrived in Spain, the 24-year-old has not taken her foot off the pedal. On Sunday, Kgatlana scored her third consecutive goal in three matches for The Gunsmiths when they lost 3-1 to Sevilla. The Mohlakeng born player is among the top scorers, having found the net eight times and provided five assists in 16 outings. She is six goals behind league leading goal scorer Esther Gonzalez of Levante Women, who has 14 goals to her name. Eibar coach Iker Dorronsoro has lauded her contribution, describing her as the benchmark for the club. “She (Kgatlana) is the benchmark player for us,” Dorronsoro said. “There’s a lot of talk about her and I think that’s good for both her and the team. She is a benchmark player not only because of the goals she scores. She is a player who is not selfish, who squeezes, who works a lot without the ball.” Meanwhile, former Banyana assistant coach Shilene Booysen has been announced as the new Senior Women’s coach for South Sudan women’s team. Booysen joined them on a two-year contract that will see her take charge of the Bright Starlets until 2023. As quoted by the South Sudan Football Association, Booysen said: “When I saw what South Sudan was doing in terms of women’s football and the strategy that the SSFA has put in place, it excites me. “And I have always wanted to be a part of something like this. This is exactly where I want to be. This is exactly what I want to do.”
