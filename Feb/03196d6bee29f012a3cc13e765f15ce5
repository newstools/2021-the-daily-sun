THE brief unsuccessful stint that Mandla Ncikazi had at Maritzburg United over five years ago toughened him up, the Golden Arrows coach has revealed. Ncikazi was sacked in his short spell as the Team of Choice coach after failing to win any of his five opening games in charge in the 2015-16 season. The former African Wanderers player learnt a lot in that stint. At Arrows, he has guided Abafana Bes’Thende to fourth place on the DStv Premiership table, having collected 25 points from 14 games. Having lost just once in the league against Cape Town City late last month, this is the best start in the club’s history. The players seemed to be buying into Ncikazi’s tactics and defensively they are sound and upfront they have impressed with the pace of the likes of Knox Mutizwa, Velemseni Ndwandwe and Pule Mmodi. The latter was a thorn in the flesh in Arrows’ recent 2-0 league victory over Orlando Pirates. The former Uthongathi FC winger netted both goals against Bucs. “The stint at Maritzburg was a lesson (for me) and it made me better. I learnt so much,” said Ncikazi. Ncikazi also highlighted that his success at Arrows is a result of knowing the majority of the players as he coached most of them in the development structures of the club when he was the head of development. “Some players have been together for nine and 10 years,” said Ncikazi. “Maybe they are comfortable with me. Another factor is that I worked with Steve Komphela, Clinton Larsen and Manqoba Mngqithi, so the players treat me as a coach, not as someone who doesn’t have an input in the club. Maybe the other reason they are comfortable with me is because most of them are from this province (Kwa-Zulu-Natal).”
