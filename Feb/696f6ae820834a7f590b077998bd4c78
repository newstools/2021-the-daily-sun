THE Swartruggens Magistrates Court in North West gave two court officials heavy sentences for stealing money meant for child support. On Friday, Lerato Ikutlwe (35) and Denis Ntshole (39) were sentenced to five years and two years imprisonment respectively, wholly suspended for five years. The duo were arrested in October 2020 and charged with 208 counts of theft after they took maintenance money from the Department of Justice, and deposited it into their personal accounts. According to the court information, when applicants came to the office to inquire why their childrenâ€™s maintenance was not paid, they would then tell them to come back later. Their tricks did not go far after many people started complaining that they were not receiving the monies the fathers of their kids were sending to the court as maintenance. Lerato was ordered to refund the state an amount of R236 874 in monthly instalments of R3 947. The court ordered her to pay the first instalment by the end of April at the office of magistrate. The court also ordered the confiscation of her pension interest to the amount of R17 866,67 as agreed between the parties. Her co-accused was ordered to refund the state an amount of R37 650 in monthly instalments of R627. He was also ordered to make his first payment by the end of April.
