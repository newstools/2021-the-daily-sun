ORLANDO Pirates are on a mission to win the Nedbank Cup. Pirates, who already have the MTN8 trophy in their cabinet, start their important assignment with a date against GladAfrica Championship side Uthongathi in the last-32 round match at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Bucs are hoping to put the setback of dropping crucial points in the Premiership behind them to ensure they progress further in the competition. They are still reeling from a shocking 2-0 defeat to Golden Arrows at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Tuesday. Pirates are hoping to restore the glory that saw them lift the trophy twice in 2011 and 2014. The last time Pirates reached the final of Ke Yona was in 2017 when they suffered a humiliating 4-1 defeat to SuperSport United at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. The following season Bucs dropped their performances as they were booted out in the second round of the competition. In 2019 and 2020, Pirates were knocked out in the first round of Mzansi’s FA Cup version. But Josef Zinnbauer’s charges have shown their determination to win trophies this season by lifting the Wafa Wafa trophy. The German coach has a strong squad that other coaches envy, but their inconsistent performances in the league recently seem to be a cause for concern. The Soweto giants will face a KwaZulu-Natal side that is high in confidence since they are playing for the first time in the last-32 round. Uthongathi have failed to qualify for the tournament on 12 occasions since 2008. Bucs will pin their hopes on Fortune Makaringe to restore their pride.
