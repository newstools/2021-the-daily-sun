 MPUMALANGA police are appealing to the public for assistance in finding a teacher who went missing in Calcutta, near Bushbuckridge on 20 July 2018. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told Daily Sun that Kevin Chitapaza (48), who is originally from Zimbabwe was staying with his family and was employed as an educator at Madzuma Secondary School at Mashonamini Trust in Calcutta. "It is said that he was driving his car, a BMW, picture attached, when he went missing and since then, he never returned to his place of residence,” he said. “The family tried to conduct a search party for him without any success. As a result, he was then reported as missing at the Calcutta Police Station. Police conducted their own investigation and searched for him as well, but the man could not be found.” Anyone with information that could help the police to locate Chitapaza is urged to contact Detective Lieutenant Colonel Duduzile Shabangu at 0824692569. Alternatively, police can be reached through the Crime Stop number at 08600 10111, or potential informants can give a tip-off via MySAPSApp which can be downloaded to any smartphone. All information will be treated with strictest confidentiality and callers may opt to remain anonymous.
