OUR kids are still alive and they will one day get out of this mine. These were the words of the families of the three trapped Lily Gold Mine workers. Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyirenda and Yvonne Mnisi remained buried underground after a rock collapsed at the mine in Louisville outside Barberton, Mpumalanga. Today, 5 February will mark five years since the tragedy. But only a few people are expected to attend the commemoration due to Covid-19 regulations. In December 2019, former workers and family members embarked on a mission to retrieve the container with the trio, but it was disrupted by lockdown. Yvonne’s father, Elmon (64), said they had high hopes that the three were alive. He said God would make a miracle and bring them back to the surface. “We don’t have faith in government, but in God. Our government has already sold us out. It has failed us and we don’t want to hear any of their tricks. We will restart our retrieval mission. No one will stop us as government failed us.” Her mum Rose Mkabi said Yvonne’s boys, 16 and 10, missed her everyday. Pretty’s mum Lomvimbi Mavuso (60) said she couldn’t wait for the day she reunited with her daughter. “We know God is not ready to surprise us. They will definitely come out. We are more than ready for that day. I will even run naked because of happiness, and slaughter cows to celebrate and thank those who have been with us all along.” Last year, Action SA president Herman Mashaba offered to help the families and workers with legal representation. Harry Mazibuko, former workers’ representative, said there were developments. The workers’ legal representatives took the business practitioner to court as it failed to disclose its rescue plan.
