A 38-YEAR-OLD former Mercedes-Benz employee went on a rampage recently. The man crashed more than 50 V-class multi-purpose vehicles. He stole an excavator at the companyâ€™s Vitoria branch in Spain and drove 21km to the factory. He then broke through the factory gate and damaged many V-Class cars.  The incident happened after a demonstration by factory workers, who said a new shift scheme implemented by Mercedes would lead to layoffs of 10 to 15% of the employees there.  The damage caused by the employee is set to be about R36 million. An entry-level V-Class costs about R1 million and the most expensive costs R1,5 million, and is designed to carry passengers in comfort.
