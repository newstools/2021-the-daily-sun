AS games are now coming thick and fast in the DStv Premiership AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy says has explained changes and absence of Usuthu’s key players. On Tuesday afternoon, AmaZulu claimed a thrilling 4-3 win over Bloemfontein Celtic at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium. AmaZulu were without the likes of Xola Mlambo and Luvuyo Memela who have played a key role this season, while Bongi Ntuli was an unused substitute. McCarthy explained their absence and said there could be more changes in his squad for the upcoming matches. “I think for me it was safeguarding players,” McCarthy said. “Too many players are getting to that stage where games are coming thick and fast and you have to do some changes tweak the team obviously we lost Memela, Bongi Ntuli given a rest, Xola Mlambo also given a rest. “Today you saw (Makhehlene) Makhaula pulling off because he needed a rest. But you can’t drop your whole team because it might disturb the whole rhythm of what we have had so far. He added: “Now I am having a worry that we have lost (Siyethemba) Sithebe for the next game.” Sithebe was stretched out against Celtic due to groin injury. The three points see AmaZulu climbing the log to the seventh spot in the league standings with 21 points after 15 matches. Mccarthy said he was happy to have registered his third win in a row and is satisfied with the points they have accumulated since he arrived at the club. He said: “I am just grateful that we were able to see it through in a dramatic fashion we ended up getting all three points. “I am happy for the players, for the effort everything they have done for the club so for, they have been tremendous. "I can only thank them from the bottom of my heart. Three wins in a trot, only one loss in eight games since I joined the club that is not a bad turnover let’s hope the good form and good spirit can continue.”
