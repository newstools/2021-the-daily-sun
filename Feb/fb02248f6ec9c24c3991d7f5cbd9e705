LIVERPOOL striker Mohamed Salah has promised Liverpool supporters that they will "fight like champions" between now and the end of the season. He gave them something to cheer about during this tough spell when he showed his great abs on Twitter with a smile. He tweeted: "It’s been a tough period for many reasons. We are champions and we will fight like champions, until the very end. "We will not allow this     season to be defined by the recent results we’ve had. That is my promise to all of you." Salah's promise could start on Tuesday as the Reds make the trip to Budapest to face RB Leipzig in the first leg of their Champions League Round of 16 tie. It’s been a tough period for many reasons. We are champions and we will fight like champions, until the very end. We will not allow this season to be defined by the recent results we’ve had. That is my promise to all of you. pic.twitter.com/gqITQfp1ua
