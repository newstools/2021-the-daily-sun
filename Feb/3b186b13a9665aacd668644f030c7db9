TS Galaxy chairman Tim Sukuza admits they missed out on some targets during the recently completed transfer window, but he was pleased they were able to bring in defender Pogiso Sanoka from Maritzburg United. Galaxy are hovering dangerously above the relegation zone, but rather than a rush of new signings for coach Owen da Gama, have added just Sanoka. “From a distance, one will look at it and say we had a quiet January/February transfer window period. But the truth is that we’ve been active behind the scenes,” Sukazi told his club’s website. “The unfortunate part is that during a transfer window, you don’t get to secure the signatures of every player that you wanted to sign. “We had our own targets. We had one or two targets but it didn’t materialize. This is very important to appreciate that it is not easy to find good players walking around during a transfer window because they are always secured or signed. “It is always mission impossible sometimes, but you do your best like we’ve done in the case of Pogiso Sanoka. I believe he is a quality defender. He plays more than one position. You don’t easily find class like that during any transfer window but we managed to secure him.” Sukazi believes his side will beat the drop and looks forward to a more settled second half of the season. “In as much as we couldn’t secure one or another two players that we wanted to get, I believe we have a very good squad and with some good depth about it. Testimony to that was the upward trajectory we had experienced in our last three games or so. “When a club does that you don’t have to sign for the sake of just being excited by the window. Your signings must be timely and must be informed by the prevailing circumstances.” Galaxy are next in action away at Chippa United on Saturday. -SuperSport
