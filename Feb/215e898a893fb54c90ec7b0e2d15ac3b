Tweeps are worried about gospel musician,
Dr Tumi after seeing a video of a person that looks like him getting mugged. The video that's trending on Twitter
shows a mugging that was caught by a CCTV. According to people, the mugging
happened on Tuesday, 23 February. The video shows the man, which people
claim be the award-winning singer, standing and talking to the phone. Two guys
pass next to him and one goes to grab the phone that he's holding onto his ear
and runs. The thug then runs towards a car that's
waiting for him and they drive off. According to tweeps who posted the video,
the mugging happened in Midrand. People on Twitter have been sharing the
video and are worried about the gospel star. Most have been tagging him and
asking if he's okay. Dr Tumi being mugged at Tshiliâ€™s Midrand yesterday. pic.twitter.com/5cudO9OQN6
