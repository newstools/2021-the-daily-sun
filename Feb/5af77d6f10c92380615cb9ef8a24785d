Officials from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will pay the families of the three trapped Lily Mine workers and former workers a “courtesy” visit on Thursday, 25 February. The families, together with former workers, have been camping outside the mine for 668 days. They’re calling on government to intervene in the retrieval of the container that Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyirenda and Yvonne Mnisi’s remains are trapped in underground. The officials are expected to give an update about the latest developments. Last year, the parliamentary portfolio committee on mineral resources suggested the mine be declared a national disaster site. The mine has been closed since the tragedy happened and a number of potential investors have been embroiled in court battles in a bid to take over the running of the mine. Last week, ActionSA announced that business rescue process practitioners published an amended plan for the mine, awarding it to a successful bidder. The plan calls for the retrieval of the container to be initiated within 60 days and the payment of all outstanding wages to the former miners.
