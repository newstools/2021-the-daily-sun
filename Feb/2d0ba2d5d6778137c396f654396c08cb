REAL Madrid players and coach Zinedine Zidane were presented with brand new wheels this week. The Spanish giants, who seem to have overcome their struggles on the pitch, have been rewarded off it. They are back in the LaLiga Santander title race after leaders Atletico Madrid’s recent stumbles. They have amassed 53 points after 24 rounds of fixtures, three points behind leaders Atleti who have a game in hand. The Madrid players were happy to take some time away from the stress of the title race and receive some welcome gifts from the club’s sponsor Audi. They were gifted their official Audi cars at an event that took place in the car park of the Alfredo Di Stéfano stadium. The players and Zidane posed individually with their new vehicles before getting into them. It's the seventeenth consecutive season that Audi and Real Madrid have formed a successful relationship. "The strength and common values that define a successful partnership that has become a global reference. The fact that this season all the vehicles that Real Madrid players will be driving will be equipped with highly efficient technologies focused on reducing emissions reinforces our commitment to offer solutions that allow us to be a leader in premium electromobility, demonstrating that sustainability can be enhanced without sacrificing Audi's DNA,” said José Miguel Aparicio, Managing Director of Audi Spain, in an official statement published on the club’s website.
