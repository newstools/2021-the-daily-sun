BEING a comedic actor has affected Simphiwe Majozi’s acting career. Because he plays a role of funny character on SABC1’s Uzalo, Simphiwe said people see him as a joke. He told Daily Sun when people see him, they laugh because they see him as Sbusiso of Uzalo. He wishes people could start taking him seriously as this has affected his other projects. “I enjoy playing Sbusiso and I believe I’m playing him well. But it’s highly worrying that most of my fans can’t differentiate between Sbusiso and Simphiwe.

Even when I try to be serious, they continue laughing,” said Simphiwe. “The fact that people laugh when they see me means that I’m playing the Sbusiso character very well. But I don’t want them to laugh every time they see me,” he said. He said he hopes to get a serious role in future. “Maybe if I get a serious role such as that of a pastor or a responsible family member, that will change how people look at me,” he said. Simphiwe’s also a musician. “My single Nizobona Ngomopho is doing well. Sometimes when I perform my single I can feel that the crowd thinks it’s Sbusiso on stage. That bothers me,” said Simphiwe.
