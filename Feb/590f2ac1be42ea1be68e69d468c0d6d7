BECAUSE he was a man of tradition, he believed the head of the family should open the bottle of whisky. But his lover and mother of his three children Palesa Moloi opened it and took a sip. Thabiso Sobekwa (38) became furious and accused her of disrespecting his culture. He then stabbed her 28 times at their rented room in Tswelopele, Tembisa, on New Year’s Day in 2019. Thabiso was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment by the Tembisa Magistrates Court on Tuesday. WATCH: MLUNGU TAKES OFF G-STRING AND WEARS IT AS MASK! Palesa’s family welcomed the sentence, saying they wished he would rot in jail as he deprived her kids of their mother’s love. Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Leshabe Moukangwe of Ivory Park Police Station was also happy with the sentence. “He claimed his culture didn’t allow for a woman to open a man’s whisky bottle. He stabbed her twice, and she fell and apologised. But he continued to stab her.” Acting station commander Colonel Baba Mpotoane said Thabiso deserved what came his way as his cruelty denied his innocent children of their mother’s love. “We welcome this sentence as it will send a clear message to any abusive spouse that our officers will ensure that justice is served,” said Mpotoane.
