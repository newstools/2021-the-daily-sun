AN intrauterine device, better known as IUD, is a form of birth control shaped like a “T”. It’s a bit bigger than a R5 coin and fits inside your uterus. It prevents pregnancy by stopping sperm from reaching and fertilising eggs. According to an article by Cosmopolitan, some guys have claimed they have actually felt the IUD during sex with their partners. One of the sources, Dan (33), complained his girlfriend of over a year and a half got an IUD several months into their relationship, and he said he could “definitely tell the difference”. His girlfriend’s ob-gyn, a doctor who specialises in pregnancy and gynecology, said Dan shouldn’t be able to feel it, to which he said he could. “It basically feels like something kind of pokey,” said Dan. “Like if you take something thin and just like slightly touch your penis with it.” While Marshall (23) said he’s had sex with a couple of women who had IUDs and could feel some stringy-like things during the deed. If your partner can feel the IUD, then it’s advised that you get it checked as migration may have occurred, in which case you should see your doctor ASAP. According to Rachna Vanjani, an ob-gyn in the Bay Area of the US, sometimes the strings might have been too long and needed to just be trimmed a bit for your partner not to feel them during the deed.
