FIFA president Gianni Infantino has reaffirmed his support for Caf and reiterated the guarantee of 10 slots for Africa in the 2026 World Cup finals.  Three years ago, the world football governing body voted for an expansion of the tournament from 32 to 48 teams, thus opening more spots for Caf in Fifa’s flagship tournament.    Infantino made a whistle-stop in Mzansi. He has already been to several countries, including Cameroon, Doha, Mauritania, Senegal, Rwanda, Congo Brazzaville and DRC Congo. He will be in Sudan tomorrow.  “After 30 years of promises that Africa will move from five to six nations. We did move from one to six within one year of my election. But we moved from five to 10 (But one must play the play-off to qualify for the World Cup),” said Infantino.  “If you have only five out of 54 countries participating in the World Cup, it is almost impossible to participate or to plan seriously for the future. Participation in the World Cup is so important. Already I was inspired by the work of the 2010 World Cup here. Doubling the numbers of participants for Africa is crucial for the development of football because it has an impact on the investment, the private sector and the government. They all work together.” “So, Africa will have more numbers in 2026, giving almost every one of you a realistic hope to participate. And 10 of you will participate in 2026. But the work to be ready to win that World Cup, not only get to the semi-finals but to have the ambition to win, starts now.”
