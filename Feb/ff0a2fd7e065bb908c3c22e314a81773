FAMILY, friends and colleagues of a man who allegedly went on a shooting spree claim he was a good man with serious issues. But to the families of his victims, Tommy Phalatsi is nothing but a murderer. On Thursday, 4 February, dozens of friends of the man who shot and killed people in Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal, and later took his own life, took to social media. They described him as a good man despite his actions. But for people such as Bianca Venter, Tommy took their loved ones away from them. On Facebook, Bianca – a relative of the father and son shot at the Slap Chips takeaway outlet – said: “My nephew died because of this man. “My uncle is in the operating theatre and will remain sedated until he’s out of danger.  Addressing Tommy directly, she said: “Shooting yourself was too easy! I don’t care what issues you had. “It wasn’t necessary to shoot innocent people.” Sakhile Mokoena claimed Tommy wasn’t a bad person. “I used to work with him. He was a good guy at work. “I wonder what may have gone down leading to what he did. May his soul rest in peace.” Captain Kay Makhubele said police are investigating charges of murder and attempted murder.
