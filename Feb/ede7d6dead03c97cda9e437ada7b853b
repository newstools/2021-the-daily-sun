IT could well be that Orlando Pirates had their minds elsewhere when they faced Uthongathi in their Nedbank last-32 at Orlando Stadium, with the Cape Town City visiting tomorrow. Their league form is a serious concern for Bucs coach Josef Zinnbauer, so much so that he could not help but keep pointing to the upcoming DStv Premiership fixture at Orlando Stadium against City (5pm), moments after the Soweto giants scraped 1-0 past the GladAfrica Championship side on Saturday. Gabadinho Mhango scored the crucial goal to help Pirates progress to the next round of Ke Yona Cup. Zinnbauer’s source of frustration, and that of the Ghosts, is that the Buccaneers cannot mount a serious challenge in the league. “We have to run, and you see it’s a very big field. It’s a lot of energy and you see the players thinking ‘Oh we have the next game against Cape Town City on Tuesday’. “Maybe it’s the mindset from the players. But what’s important is that we are in the next round and that was the target today,” said Zinnbauer. “We have to focus on the next game against City and then we have to wait which opponent is coming, and then we have time to focus on the Nedbank. “But first is next week, the league then comes to Caf (competition). We had a lot in the past and we have a lot in the future.” But what is more, for the fickle fans, some of who have bizarrely called for Zinnbauer’s head, is that the gap is widening between Bucs and their rivals Mamelodi Sundowns. They have twice been beaten to the league’s holy grail in the past three years and Sundowns have already established an eight-point gap on them in this campaign. Zinnbauer’s men are fifth with 25 points on the log, while the Citizens are on their heels, sitting sixth on 23 points. A win won’t necessarily take them into the top three. But will help build momentum for bigger challenges – in the Nedbank and Caf, this month.
