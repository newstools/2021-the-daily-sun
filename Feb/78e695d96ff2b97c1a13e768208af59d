THE natural-looking Wonderbra and Playtex cleavage may soon not be available in the market. The manufacturer of these popular brands in Mzansi is reportedly closing its doors due to the economic conditions. Over the years, Wonderbra and Playtex brands have become very competitive in the underwear industry, aiming for a rounded and natural-looking cleavage as well as comfort for special occasions and everyday wear. While some women have expressed disappointment, others told Daily Sun that they were not bothered by the closure. Pretty Sibeko (55) said she was still waiting to find a brand that worked for her. She said for the past four years, she had been trying out different kinds of bras, but nothing worked for her. “I hate wearing a bra. In the last few years, I’ve been itching whenever I wear a bra. Nothing in the market works for me. At times I will feel like ripping off my bra on the spot because it’s uncomfortable. I’m not bothered by the closure of any company that makes bras because none of them cater for my breast,” said Pretty. Lala Mokoni (65) said: “I have never bought a bra based on the brand. I’m driven by comfort, so I shop anywhere for bras that are comfortable for my needs.” Amanda Moloi (49) said: “I’ve always been obsessed about sexy underwear, including lingerie. I spent at least R600 on underclothes. A sexy bra and lace underwear makes me feel neat and good about myself, and also gives me confidence around my man. Wonderbra has been the best.” Zazi Thwala (42) said she preferred Playtex. “They are comfortable and provide great posture, unlike cheap bras. I’m definitely going to be affected, especially when going out for special occasions. I spent between R300 and R1 000 on undergarments, and I guess I will have to look for other brands that will provide the same comfort,” said Zazi. Pulane Fiee (24) said: “I used to prefer sports bras. But now I go for anything comfortable and affordable, irrespective of the store or the brand.”
