 A lawyer from Texas had a social cat-ostrophe after he accidentally activated a cat filter during a court hearing which was held via Zoom and broke the net. The video which has close to 30 million views on Twitter shows attorney Rod Ponton struggling to deactivate the filter while appearing as a kitten. In the video, Judge Roy B Ferguson is overheard trying to help the struggling attorney but to no avail. “Mr. Ponton, I believe you have a filter turned on in your video settings,” says Ferguson. The funniest part of the clip has to be when the struggling Ponton tries to reassure the judge that he is not a cat. “I’ve got my assistant here, and she’s trying to remove it but uh… I’m prepared to go forward with it," Ponton says. "I’m here live. I’m not a cat.” “I can see that,” responds judge   A lawyer using Zoom had to let a judge know that he wasn’t a cat after inadvertently activating a face filter pic.twitter.com/vChc14mjM1  In a statement to Vice, Ponton said the mistake happened after he opted to use his secretary's computer. “I was using her computer and for some reason, she had that filter on. I took it off and replaced it with my face," he said. "It was a case involving a man trying to exit the United States with contraband and contraband cash. All it was a mistake. It was taken off and we had the hearing as normal.”
