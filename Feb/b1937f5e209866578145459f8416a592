GASTON Sirino is not a madcap as people might think.So says Mamelodi Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi, who is happy to see the enterprising midfielder back to his best form, playing a key role in the team’s success so far.The Uruguayan missed the early part of the season due to injury. There was also an issue of the protracted talks over his failed transfer move to Egyptian giants Al Ahly.But he never lost his head. Instead he knuckled down and won back his place in the star-studded Masandawana team, seen as he made his first appearance of the season in their 2-0 league victory over Baroka on 9 January.He has never looked back since.Mngqithi said: “We are all very happy. We know what Sirino gives to the team.“It is always difficult for a player to concentrate on his game when there are transfer issues. But as soon as Sundowns made a clear decision that they were keeping Gaston, he came back and helped the team.Mngqithi added: “Make no mistake, he is a very good boy. He is not as mad as people think. He knows we believe in him. We’ve got a very big team and he knows that. That is also a bigger advantage because, even when he was not playing, the team was winning.“He also likes the game. He wants to play every match and if you do not perform at Sundowns it is very difficult for anyone to get the opportunity.”Sundowns will be back in action on Sunday when they visit CR Belouizdad in a Caf Champions League group match, which will be played at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salam, Tanzania (3pm).
