SOME of us have often thought that make-up was for women or performing artists. We’ve even wrongfully deemed those that wear it not beautiful enough because it’s not “natural beauty”. According to the above statements and recent trends, these sentiments are rapidly diminishing because more men are wearing make-up. According to global trends, male grooming is now a multi-billion pound worldwide industry, thanks to a growing number of men spending more on their appearance. It’s not only his facewash and cream that is in the bathroom cabinet. You will also find his make-up kit. Many beauty experts argue that make-up gives men masculine benefits by contouring a more pronounced jawline, attracting women or fixing so-called “skin problems”.Furthermore, male make-up vloggers such as Patrick Starrr, James Charles and Jeffree Star have over six million YouTube subscribers between them. Through the platform, the world has realised how financially lucrative the male make-up industry is. Lastly, if the research of men who are dissatisfied with the overall appearance is anything to go by, then more men, like women, will soon have their own make-up kits.
