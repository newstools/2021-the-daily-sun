IF
anyone achieves a 96% in an exam, test or any other assessment, this would qualify
as a distinction, an over achiever to say the least. The same analogy sadly canâ€™t be said when it comes to alcohol, because the most potent booze in the world has an alcohol percentage of 96%. Yes, Spirytus Vodka which is made of premium ethyl alcohol with an agricultural cereal origin. It's made in Poland and its uses vary from preparing home-made fruit and herbal liqueurs, vodkas and desserts to medical purposes. One review found by The Wall Street Journal called it death in a bottle with a hellish burning aftertaste. The signature burn will leave you knocked, and it may kill just about anything. According to mixologists, alcohol at this strength can be very dangerous if consumed to excess this should never be drunk neat, but rather used very sparingly as a 'float' to give cocktails an extra kick. At the end of February, spirytus sold out in Japan as fears of Covid-19 mounted.
