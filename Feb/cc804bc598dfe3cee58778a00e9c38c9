SOUTH African is in mourning, following the death of legendary boxing trainer and manager Mzimasi "Mzi" Mnguni. Mnguni died on Saturday morning aged 73. The Eastern Cape boxing icon had been battling ill-health since he suffered a stroke in 2014, which left him in a wheelchair. Mnguni shot to prominence as a trainer after he produced the most world boxing champions in the country, including Vuyani “The Beast” Bungu. The Eastern Cape province has paid tribute to Mzi, mainly for the crucial role he played in the promotion and development of boxing in the country. "While his passing is the last round of the late part of his life, Mr Mnguni’s legacy and contribution to boxing is an everlasting mark in the boxing world," said provincial spokesperson Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha. "We have a moral duty to keep on supporting boxing so that our province can regain its position as the home of boxing champions." Former Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula presented Mnguni with a Lifetime Achievement Award while his successor, Thulas Nxesi also honoured the legend with a similar award.
