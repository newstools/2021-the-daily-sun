THERE have
been a spate of murders at the Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi, south of Durban,
for the past few years. A task team
was established to investigate these incidents and on Friday, cops successfully
arrested a wanted hitman, known as Laqhasha. He was
arrested while hiding in Lamontville, KZN. Laqhasha,
real name Thobani Mahobo (35), appeared in the Umlazi Magistrates Court on two
counts of murder and has been remanded in police custody until 22 February. It is
alleged that on 15 November last year, Anele Chutshane and Phumlani Ntozakhe,
both 27, were shot and killed by the suspect when they came out of their room
at Glebelands Hostel. “They were
both certified dead at the scene. The accused has a pending assault with intent
to cause grievous bodily harm case against him after he assaulted his
ex-girlfriend while she was inside her room in the Glebelands Hostel in June
last year,” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said. The accused
will further be profiled to determine whether he is linked to other serious
crimes committed within the province. ) In
another incident, the Umlazi Regional Court convicted and sentenced Bheki
Goodman Cele (51) to eight years imprisonment for possession of unlicensed
firearm and ammunition. Cele was
arrested by the Glebelands Task Team after he was found in possession of a
pistol loaded with six rounds of ammunition in the hostel.
