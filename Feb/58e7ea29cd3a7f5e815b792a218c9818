Here's another reason for men to exercise: it may extend their sex lives. Men 50 and older who are physically active are up to 30 percent less likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than men who don't exercise, according to a new study from the Harvard School of Public Health. The research studyThe
 researchers studied data from questionnaires by 31 742 men between ages
 53 to 90, reports the Associated Press. Men who were able to run at 
least three hours per week benefited most, because they seemed to 
achieve the sexual ability of men two to five years younger than their 
actual ages. And there was still a 15 percent to 20 percent 
reduction in the risk of erectile dysfunction among men who took a brisk
 walk of 30 minutes at least four days per week, the researchers say. Help for the small arteriesWriting
 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, the scientists say exercise
 appears to benefit the small arteries that control erections, much like
 the benefit seen in arteries that feed the heart, the AP reports. â€“
