PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) clubs will be rushing to conclude last minute deals before the transfer window shuts at midnight. A number of teams have already been flexing their muscles in the market in an attempt to bolster their squads, hoping to finish the season strongly. But as is always the case, the mid-season window always proves to be a tricky one to negotiate with clubs reluctant to let go of their players. However, that has not stopped a handful of clubs from going out and getting their targets. The big snap up has been that of Rushine De Reuck by Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns from Maritzburg United. The defender was for a long time linked with Soweto giants Orlando Pirates, but Downs ended up winning the race for his signature. Another notable signing so far has been that of Zukile Kewuti by AmaZulu on loan until the end of the season from Cape Town City. Kewuti has been reunited with his former coach at City in Benni McCarthy. Meanwhile, the Citizens have bolstered their midfield with the acquisition of former Nigeria under-20 captain, Abdul Ajagun. The Mother City outfit, however, have made their biggest deals in the form of contract renewals extending the deals of Thabo Nodada, Abbubaker Mobara and Craig Martin. Maritzburg United have also been active in an attempt to stave off relegation by snapping up German goalkeeper, Marcelo Engelhardt. The 27-year-old has joined the Team of Choice from Eintracht Braunschweig, who are campaigning in German 2 Bundesliga. In Port Elizabeth, Chippa United have signed former Sundowns and Orlando Pirates midfielder, Thamsanqa Sangweni. The Chilli Boys are hoping to finish in the top eight and believe the return of their former midfielder will go a long way in helping them achieve that goal. Unfortunately, Kaizer Chiefs will not have the opportunity to bolster their squad as they continue to be banned by Fifa from signing any new players until the next transfer window.
