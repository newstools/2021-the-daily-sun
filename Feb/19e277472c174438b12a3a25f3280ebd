TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) are looking at taking their Nedbank Cup form into the DStv Premiership. On Friday TTM, eliminated Swallows FC in the last-16 of the Nedbank Cup 4-3 on penalties after playing to an entertaining 2-2 draw on regular time. They became the first team to beat Swallows since the Dube Birds were promoted from GladAfrica Championship. Without a doubt, the victory will be a huge morale booster to TTM who have been struggling in the league. After 16 league matches, TTM have only won three, played six draws and lost eight matches. That leaves them with just 15 points and they are occupying position 14 on the log standings. After beating Swallows, Vhadau Vha Damani caretaker coach Mpho Maleka said they are now looking at building from this win to try and climb the log standings. “Firstly, let me say thanks to the guys [players] for a job well done and again following the game plan,” said Maleka. “We knew that they (Swallows) can concede and we have proven it as we were aware of their weaknesses, but it was unfortunate for us to concede two goals. Yes, it is homework for us as much as we say the game is the teacher. Maleka went on: “With this win, we showed character and determination, we can be proud and with this dedication, it is going to give us an edge going forward. This is a good injection to face the league and climb the leader.” Next Sunday (7 March), the two sides will lock horns again in a league match at Dobsonville Stadium where TTM will be hoping to maintain their four games unbeaten run.
