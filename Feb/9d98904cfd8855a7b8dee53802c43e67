KHULEKANI Ncube used to make ends meet by taking pictures in his kasi. Now the 24-year-old from Delmas, Mpumalanga, has shot and produced a film titled The Recurring Pain (life of Lerato), which is currently available on YouTube. Khulekani said the idea hit him last year, and he then got a script writer and cast. The film was completed in November. “I didn’t wait to get funds to start the project. I dug deep in my pocket. “It was not an easy project to start, but I had to do everything to realise my dream. I am unemployed and there are many unemployed young people in my kasi,” he said. “I pitched the idea on social media and the response was great. Many people were happy to take part. I used the little money I earned by taking pictures to ensure that the project became a reality.” ALSO READ:AMAPIANO GOGO SINGS FROM THE GRAVE! Khulekani said the film was a story about a teenage girl who was raised by her sick mother. “She then got influenced by her friends to join the flashy lifestyle of blessers to change the situation at home. She ended up dropping out of school,” he said. “She later found out that her mother was sick because she had HIV. While trying to live a lavish lifestyle, she found out she was pregnant and HIV-positive.” Khulekani told the People’s Paper that the story gained a lot of fans around his community. His biggest wish was for talent in his kasi to grow and for the cast to get bigger roles in TV shows. He also wanted his production to grow.
