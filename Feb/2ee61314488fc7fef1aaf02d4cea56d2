POLICE Minister Bheki Cele said cops are closing in on the suspects who killed six people in a house in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, on Saturday night. Cele was in the area on Wednesday, 3 February, after he visited the Ravensmead area where two 16-year-old boys and a 45-year-old man were shot and killed last Friday. Speaking about the Khayelitsha incident, Cele said cops were making progress. “Nobody has been arrested here but we are not very far from the people we’re pursuing,” he said. “Six people have been profiled and we found some of these people were involved in some other things. “Interestingly, this includes the owner of the house, (where the shooting occurred). The owner of the house is not very much clean for the fact that he is attending a case of the murder of an SAPS member,” said Cele. He said the shooting incident seems to be connected to the extortion racket that has been taking place in Khayelitsha. Cele said they established a steering committee to fight extortion in kasi and has urged residents who are being abused by extortionist to report them on 021 466 0011. According to cops, three gunmen stormed into a house where a group of friends were drinking booze. They shot the people who were in the house, leaving six dead and one fighting for his life in the hospital. In the Ravensmead incident, Cele said a person has been bust and cops are expecting to make more arrests. He said from the cops investigations, the incident is gang-related but the two teenagers were just caught in the crossfire “Our information tells us that those were two young good innocent young people as per the profiling of the police. It looks as if they were at the wrong place at the wrong time,” said Cele.
