THE Red Berets in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, have opened criminal charges against an ANC ward councillor and municipality regional manager over grave violation at a local cemetery. This after the incident last week where a family was allocated a site to bury their relative and while digging the grave, accidentally exhumed human bones. Furious member Prince Matlhavane told Daily Sun that they witnessed, with great shock, negligence by the municipality over graves of other people. “We believe this graveyard is a heritage site where our grannies have been buried. But because the municipality doesn’t have enough space to accommodate more burials, it ended up allocating it even though other people had already buried their relatives on it,” said Matlhavane. “So as EFF, we had serious concern and want to plead with the municipality to find another burial site as this one has reached full capacity,” said Matlhavane. “We want the people responsible for this to face the law. The municipality and ward councillor are the ones responsible for authorising people to dig graves. So we have opened criminal charges, and will monitor the case until we see justice on behalf of the families whose ancestors were disturbed.” Bushbuckridge local municipality spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said they would investigate the matter. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed a case of violation of grave after human bones were exhumed was opened. “A certain family was busy digging a grave. Accidentally, the old grave was affected. The matter was reported to police. Investigations continue as no arrest were made,” said Hlathi.
