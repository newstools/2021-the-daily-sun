DURBAN comedian Mondli Mzizi used lockdown to develop home-made imbiza to heal people. Mondli was currently focused on producing it to heal asthma-related diseases, and said he had received good feedback. He said they had sent samples to be tested at a medicine laboratory called Mérieux NutriSciences in Pretoria and Cape Town so they could sell at pharmacies. He told Daily Sun that lockdown forced him to do something. “Healing people while making money is helping to keep me busy during lockdown. “Since posting a picture of the imbiza weeks ago, we’ve gained buyers. They’ve told us that they see a difference,” he said. “This is an old home-made imbiza that my father used to produce.” Mondli said they sent it for tests because they wanted to know how long it could stay sealed before use or stay if it had been opened. Nomvalo Lungelwa from Umzimkhulu said she started using imbiza on 20 January when she was suffering from short breath. “I’m feeling better now after using it.” It’s available around KZN.
