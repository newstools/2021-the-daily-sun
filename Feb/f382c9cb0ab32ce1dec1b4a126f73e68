Betway South Africa has partnered with different sporting personalities to launch their new innovative community initiative, the #BetwayCares Skills Hub. The nationwide programme aims to bridge the gap between the shortage of skills programmes and the employability of the South African community during such challenging economic times. Betway will be travelling the lengths and breaths of the country, affording communities a platform to enhance their coaching, refereeing and administration skills through accredited courses and workshops provided through the Skills Hub. They will be partnering with various sport federations, training institutions and key stakeholders to bring lasting solutions to the challenges faced by the sport fraternity including; a lack of trained coaches, officials and administrators. Betway has partnered with sport personalities which include Proteas legend, Makhaya Ntini, former Banyana Banyana captain, Simphiwe Dludlu, former Springbok captain, Victor Matfield, as well as SA Netball senior national team assistant coach, Dumisani Chauke for the initiative. The selected sporting icons all share a common passion with the brand of giving back and will be part of the various monthly training programmes. “Working closely with Betway last year through its #BetwayCares programme, demonstrated the brand’s keen interest in giving back to communities in a meaningful way. The #BetwayCares Skills Hub comes at an opportune time where there is a serious need for skills training in our communities. While football remains my passion, I am even more excited to see how the #BetwayCares Skills Hub will empower individuals across different sporting codes across the country,” said an elated Dludlu.
