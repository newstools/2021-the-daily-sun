HE was one of the most promising youngsters at one point. But unfortunately, Excellent Walaza could not reach the heights he was tipped to reach in his career. The forward who hails from Soweto joined the Orlando Pirates academy in 2005 when he was around 18-years-old. His goal-scoring talents were hard to ignore and he would progress to eventually earn promotion to the senior team. He burst onto the professional scene in the 2007-08 season where he established himself as a senior team player scoring eight goals. He finished that season as Piratesâ€™ top scorer. Walaza endeared himself to the Bucs faithful when he scored a memorable brace in the Soweto derby against arch-rivals Kaizer Chiefs that season. But his promising Bucs career was relatively short-lived as he was later sent out on a string of loan moves to PSL teams following a few struggles. He joined SuperSport United on loan in the 2009-10 season where he made five appearances and scored one goal. He was then loaned out to Bloemfontein Celtic where he made 23 appearances and scored three goals the following season. Walaza spent the 2010-11 season with Vasco Da Gama on loan, playing ten times but failing to find the back of the net. The forward faded into the football wilderness pretty early in his career. He is only turning 34 this year but is already one of the forgotten stars. Walaza earned two Bafana Bafana caps during his career. He last played professionally for lowly Atile in the second tier in 2012.
