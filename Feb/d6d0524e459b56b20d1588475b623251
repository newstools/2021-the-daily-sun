A great philosopher once said there are two certainties in life â€“ change and death. While change is inevitable, we often struggle with death as it always brings about a mixed bag of emotions. Without sounding like a life insurance advertisement, death is a sad eventuality we have to embrace. Interestingly, however, it seems that men are more likely to be the first ones to bite the dust. According to the world data, there are biological, behavioural and environmental factors that contribute to the fact that women live longer than men. According to the 2020 World Health Organisation report, women generally live longer than men on average by six to eight years. This difference is partly due to an inherent biological advantage for the female, but it also reflects behavioural differences between men and women. Women also have oestrogen in their corner. Scientists have shown that testosterone may stimulate the prostate gland and increase the risk of prostate cancer. Studies also reveal that testosterone improves reproductive function earlier in life, but shortens the lifespan in the long run.
