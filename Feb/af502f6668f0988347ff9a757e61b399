A MANHUNT has been launched by Limpopo police after two petrol attendants were shot and killed in Bothashoek Village outside Burgersfort yesterday. The colleagues, 21-year-old Julendah Nkomo and 40-year-old Rolly Magabe, were inside a room when the armed suspects pounced on them. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Nkomo’s brother allegedly woke up after hearing gunshots and rushed to her room. He found the bodies of the deceased in a pool of blood. By that time, the assailants had already fled the scene. “When police and medical personnel arrived at the scene, both colleagues were certified dead,” said Ngoepe. “Investigations and a manhunt for the suspects were immediately activated. “There are no arrests yet, and the motive for the incident is still unknown.” Anyone with information may contact Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501, Detective-Sergeant Cedrick Rapepe on 073 477 8716, or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
