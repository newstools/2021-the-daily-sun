BONGANI Zungu has apologised to the Rangers fans for breaking the Covid-19 rules and is back in training.  The Bafana Bafana midfielder has been on suspension as he self-isolated after he breached the Covid-19 regulations in Scotland.  But according to GlasgowLive, Zungu has expressed regret for his irresponsible actions after he went out partying last week.        Zungu joined Rangers on loan from French side Amiens, but he is yet to entrench himself in Steven Gerrardâ€™s Ranger team.  He has so far made 11 appearances as a substitute and only one start since he arrived at the beginning of the season.
