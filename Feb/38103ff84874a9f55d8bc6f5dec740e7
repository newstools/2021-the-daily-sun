DANIEL Mahlangu needs help to build a school to empower his community. But he does not have enough building material to complete the building. Daniel, who founded Relebogile Self Help Organisation in Block TT, Soshanguve, Tshwane, is asking for donations to build more classrooms. He said the school was started in 2009. “Our aim is to provide skills to the community,” he said. He said they engaged government to provide them with services and teachers. “The only thing it didn’t provide was the building. We had to build the school ourselves,” he said. Daniel said they wanted to teach bricklaying, sewing and knitting. “We want to teach our community skills as people from Block TT are disadvantaged. “We have four classrooms and need at least another eight,” he told Daily Sun. Daniel said they needed machines for knitting, carpentry and a shelter for brick laying and machines. Daniel, who is a teacher, said his wish was for the project to grow and impact the lives of many people in the area.
