FOR years, thugs would steal from Manelisi “Rasta” Notshe. But thanks to cameras he has mounted outside his mkhukhu, those days are in the past. The 46-year-old from Gugulethu in Cape Town said after several break-ins at the huge shack he does business from, he decided to live there with his family but it didn’t stop the thugs. He said he sold vegetables and repaired appliances at the shop. “I couldn’t take it any more so I decided to increase my security by mounting cameras on my shack to see who’s stealing from me.” Rasta said the cameras installed in 2017 for about R7000, allowed him to see everything going on in the street while sitting inside. He said he could now spot thugs from far. “I can see from the camera that a person is up to something, so I keep monitoring their movements. No one is robbed on the streets around here because the cameras can see them.” Residents said since Rasta moved into the shack permanently, crime had gone down dramatically in the area. Community leader Aaron Jack said: “He is also part of a local patrol team. He is a no-nonsense person and even the thugs know him. “We can now safely walk around at night without fear. People used to get robbed in broad daylight here,” he said. Resident Noluthando Mshepana (41) said drug addicts used to terrorise people in the area, but things have changed.
