THE ex-husband of the late Nomasonto "Mshoza" Maswanganyi, Jacob "Don King" Mnisi, has ventured into boxing! The J4Joy Foods businessman will host a world class professional boxing tournament at the Sandton Convention Centre on 26 March. According to Mnisi, J4Joy will host a total of eight bouts (16 Boxers) comprising the SA National Lightweight 12 round title fight between champion Tshifiwa Munyai and challenger Khaya Busakwe. On the same night, J4Joy Foods will also stage the vacant WBA PAN African Continental Junior Featherweight title fight and vacant WBA PAN African Continental Junior Featherweight Title fight over 12 rounds. Mnisi said boxers are not paid continuously like soccer players, "they only get paid per fight, so if there are no fights they do not make an income and their livelihoods are affected and they struggle to feed their families‚Äù. He added that his company's effort is also to create content for the SABC because "we know they were forced to stop showcasing boxing on our TV screens due to a lack of consistent boxing bills". "So we want to play our part by providing content that will contribute in saving jobs at the national broadcaster by staging a bill every second month for the next five years, in partnership with Boxing South Africa (BSA), World Boxing Association (WBA), and other continental and international boxing bodies," said Mnisi, who has decided to venture into the boxing industry as promoter. He will further stage the South African National Lightweight Title Fight where the national champion will be defending against the number one contender, who is the current Gauteng Provincial Lightweight champion. As a former boxer himself, Mnisi, according to a statement from his company, is aware of the internal challenges that are faced within the boxing industry. "Such are challenges like lack of opportunity and platforms for boxers to display their skills and qualify for titles," added the statement.
