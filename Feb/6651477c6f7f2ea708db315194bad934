MOTHERS are unhappy with the R10 grants increase. They said this is an insult and goes to show how government undermines them. They told Daily Sun the most annoying thing is that government can afford to give them a higher increment. Mavis Sithole said she lost her job due to the pandemic. She said this is an insult and government knows how badly they need this money. “We need to pray for these so-called leaders. They don’t even see how many people are hungry. Some kids don’t even have shoes or school clothes,” said Mavis. Sarah Mangena said the problem is that people think women just have kids for the sake of getting grants, and that’s where the problem starts. “When I had my first kid, things were good for me financially. But when I had my second child things went sideways,” she said. “My husband left me and everything just went south for me. I don’t have to explain what happened, but I really need this money.” Samkelisiwe Ndlovu said: “I’ve lost faith in our government. I thought the minister was going to tell us he was joking, but I played myself,” said Samkelisiwe.
