THEY have saved many motorists from getting their wheels damaged. After heavy rains most roads are left with gaping holes that damage tyres. These young men have turned potholes into a lucrative business. After closing these holes, they ask for a donation from motorists. But motorists are accusing these boys of closing the holes and later coming back to reopen them. Motorist Nkele Seopa (40) said she was surprised to see holes on Alwyn Road in Nellmapius, Tshwane being filled for two weeks by the same people. “Every day they’re there, filling those potholes. Those are just mere potholes. “It should take less than an hour to fill them,” she said. Nkele said she realised the boys had turned the potholes into a business. “They’re making a lot of money with the donations we give them. It’s clear these holes are an opportunity to make a quick buck. This is not done to help motorists,” she said. Another motorist, Sibu Ngwenya (25), said she once saw people clearing potholes of soil. “It can only be the people who filled the potholes with sand during the day. I see this often,” she told Daily Sun. Sibu said she then decided to stop giving them money. “By giving them money we’re encouraging them to dig more potholes so that they can get money. It’s suspicious because even if the holes are filled by professionals, after some time they are open again,” she said.
