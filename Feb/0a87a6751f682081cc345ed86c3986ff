FORMER president Jacob Zuma and EFF leader Julius Malema’s meeting over tea was a gathering of corrupt people who’re feeling the pressure of law enforcement agencies cracking the whip. This was the view of political analyst Ralph Mathekga. He also questioned how the ANC was quiet as Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina and NEC member Tony Yengeni were at the meeting, which was held in Nkandla, KZN, on Friday. “For me that meeting was of corrupt people who are correlating. These people are taking advantage of the fact that President Cyril Ramaphosa is weak and not in control.” Mathekga said it was shocking to hear Ramaphosa say Zuma can still be persuaded to appear before the Zondo Commission. This is because Zuma remained defiant even after the Constitutional Court ruled he should appear before the commission. Zuma came out to say the commission was politicised and he was ready to be jailed for defying the court. His statements prompted Malema to ask for a tea meeting. EFF spokesman Vuyani Pambo said: “The tea went very well. The tea was nice and sweet. It was essentially a tea meeting.” Pambo flatly refused to answer whether the two leaders discussed Zuma’s defiance to appear before the commission. He also refused to answer why Malema was accompanied by Advocate Dali Mpofu. Malema himself snubbed journalists as he emerged from Zuma’s homestead.
