What do musicians Pharrell Williams, Mafikizolo and Big Nuz have in common? They’ve all released smash hit singles titled Happy. If you pay close attention to the three songs, they all highlight the importance of being happy. And this seems to be the case with South Africans and their love of alcohol. This was very evident after the president on Monday night announced the lift on the sale of alcohol. So, why do we love our beverages so much? According to a study, drinking alcohol triggers the release of endorphins, chemicals that produce feelings of pleasure in certain areas of the brain. Researchers compared the brain images of 13 heavy drinkers and 12 other people before and after they’d had an alcoholic drink. In all the study participants alcohol caused endorphins to be released in specific areas of the brain and the higher the level of endorphins, the better drinkers reported feelings. While it’s important to drink responsibly, it seems alcohol can be the happy tablet the bartender has ordered.
