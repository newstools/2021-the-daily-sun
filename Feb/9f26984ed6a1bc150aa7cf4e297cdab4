IT seems itâ€™s just South Africans who must deal with bad Polo drivers. After all, these drivers have been known for being reckless on the roads. As such, a dash cam video of a VW Polo TSI driving through a red robot has surfaced on social media. In the video, the white Polo can be seen driving towards a red robot and slowing down. Instead of coming to a standstill, the driver decides otherwise. When the Polo is in the middle of the intersection, a blue car comes speeding and crashes into the right side of the vehicle.
