The corruption case against former president Jacob Zuma has been certified ready for trial. The Pietermaritzburg High Court heard that the trial will be start on 17 May 2021. Former president Jacob Zuma and French arms company Thales are in the Pietermaritzburg High Court today. But the matter is not expected to go to trial yet. The matter was last in court in December last year when it was postponed following an application by Thales to have the racketeering charges against it dropped. Zuma and Thales face corruption, racketeering and money laundering charges linked to the multimillion rand arms deal.
