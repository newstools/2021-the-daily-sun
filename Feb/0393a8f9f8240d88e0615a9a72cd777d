THE open space near Bosasa in Mfuleni, Cape Town, was a well-known magosha turf. But the spot turned into a church when the magoshas left last year, and backyarders invaded the land. Church leader Nobesuthu Ntibane told Daily Sun that she used to attend another church in Philippi but God showed her a vision to open a new one. She quoted the story of Jacob from the Bible when he changed his name to Israel after an encounter with an angel.  “God knew that this place needed to change. He knew it needed some grace so it could change from the bad things it was known for,” she said. “It’s now a place of hope and fulfilment of dreams. God had a reason to send me here.” Nobesuthu is also a caregiver at a local psychiatric hospital.  “I work at night and help people in the afternoon – it is what my calling demands. I cannot ignore it because whenever I tried to do so, I got seriously ill,” she added. Residents from Covid-19 squatter camp told Daily Sun that they were happy to have a church in the area. “We had to go back to where we used to live just so we can attend church. We are happy to have a church in the area,” said resident Mfanelo Sibeko.
