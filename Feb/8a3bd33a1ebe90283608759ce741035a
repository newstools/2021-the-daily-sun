AMAZULU have signed midfielder Zukile Kewuti on loan from Cape Town City. Kewuti will only spend the second round of this season, the Mother City club has confirmed. The 25-year-old will be reunited with his former coach Benni McCarthy and Vasili Manousakis, who was McCarthy’s assistant at City. McCarthy was the one who promoted Kewuti in 2017-18 season, the same campaign he was appointed as the club coach before he was sacked in November 2019. Together they won the MTN8 trophy in McCarthy’s second season in charge in 2018-19 when they defeated SuperSport United in the final. The Nyanga-born midfielder has struggled to break into City’s line up this season. He has only featured once, spending 55 minute on the pitch as City coach Jan Old Riekerink prefers Thabo Nodada and Thato Mokeke in the midfielder. Kewuti will join the likes of Makhehleni Makhaula, Sicelo Mkhize, Siphelele Nene, Thembela Sikhakhane, Limbikani Mzava, Samkelo Mgwazela, Siphelele Mthembu, Luvuyo Memela, Augustine Mulenga, Siphiwe Tshabalala, Xola Mlambo, Veli Mothwa and Phakamani Mahlambi as one of an array signings Usuthu have made this season since Sandile Zungu bought the club last year October.
