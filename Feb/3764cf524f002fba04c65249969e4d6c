AROUND 3 000 pupils in Gauteng have dropped out of school due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said this shouldn’t be allowed. Lesufi was speaking on Monday, 15 February at the handover of the newly built Abram Hlophe Primary School in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. “At least 3 000 learners in Gauteng didn’t return to school last year when we wanted learners to come back. “They didn’t write their exams, which means they failed the subjects or parents felt they should hold on their children and not allow them to come to school.” Lesufi said the department will dispatch a team to trace and locate those children. He said if a child drops out they’re likely to go to prison or become dependent on a social grant. Lesufi said they’re saddened after the department lost 34 teachers who succumbed to Covid-19. They’re part of the over 1 000 teachers nationally who’ve died as a result of the deadly disease. This year the department will welcome 120 000 grade 1 pupils and release 104 000 matrics. “We’re proud of the 104 000 matrics who braved everything to go to class and write their matric exams. “Next week we’ll be giving them certificates, and I can tell you that majority of them passed.”
