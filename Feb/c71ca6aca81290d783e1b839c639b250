MITTAH Tshweu was thrilled to give birth to her twins in 2009. But her happiness soon turned into pain. She started experiencing severe pain around her lower abdomen. Now her stomach is as hard as a rock. The 41-year-old from Phela, outside Rustenburg in the North West, said she started experiencing pain after she had a C-section at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. As time went by the area around her incision started to harden, becoming painful, while her stomach got swollen. “The pain would be so bad that I’d be unable to walk. I went back to the hospital in 2015 but the pain continued, and I kept going back with no luck. There’s no painkiller I have not tried to ease the pain,” she said. Mittah told Daily Sun she ruled out being bewitched, saying she would have known. “I’m tired of going to the hospital, only to return with nothing,” she said. “I was once told to seek help from a private doctor, but where will I get the money? “When this pain started I thought it would pass, but I was wrong. “I’ve prayed to die on many occasions. “I can’t walk a distance without getting tired and groaning in pain. “It’s worse when I’m on my periods because blood just keeps flowing out. “I have children to care for. I must hire a special vehicle to transport me door to door when I need to run errands.” Hospital spokesman Nkosiyethu Mazibuko said the hospital made arrangements to meet with Mittah for a full review. Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said the department was investigating the matter.
