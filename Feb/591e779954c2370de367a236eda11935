AS a former defender, Motjeka Madisha prided himself on solid defensive performances. And perhaps Mamelodi Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi had that in mind when he paid tribute to the late defender, whose death was confirmed by the club a few days ago. The Brazilians had Chippa United against the ropes for better periods of their DStv Premiership encounter on Sunday, but often let them off the hook with a 2-0 defeat. The marauding Sundowns could have buried their opponents with an avalanche of goals, had it not been for their poor finishing. “Maybe Madisha wanted us to only score two because we were playing for him,” said Mngqithi. "So I think it's fair to give him the two goals that he might have wanted. Because I honestly believe we deserve to score more than four, five goals,” Lebohang Maboe and Gaston Sirino respectively scored their first league goals, but the likes of Lyle Lakay, Gift Motupa and Peter Shalulile couldn’t take advantage of Chippa’s leaky defence.
