THE case against Tshepo Mashego has once again been postponed to 12 April. Mashego, a former Wata Taxi Association driver, appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court yesterday. He’s accused of killing Sanelisiwe Mfaba (29) after her body was found in Dobsonville Gardens in June. Daily Sun reported on her gruesome murder after protesters found her body under a tree next to a petrol station. Sanelisiwe’s body was found in a plastic bag and she had been stabbed repeatedly. Her hands and feet were bound together. Sanelisiwe’s sister, Xolile, said she had last seen Sanelisiwe when Mashego picked her up from a funeral. Xoli said Mashego later sent her an SMS claiming Sanelisiwe was too drunk so he would bring her back the next day. “I believe he had already killed her when he sent me the message. “Investigations suggested he killed her inside his taxi on the spot where she was found because the tracker indicates he parked there for an hour and a half,” said Xoli. The family received a lot of support from the public including Wata/JTA, who distanced themselves from Mashego’s alleged evil deeds.
