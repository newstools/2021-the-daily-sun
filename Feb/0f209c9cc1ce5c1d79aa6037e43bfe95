Netball is set to resume in Mzansi. This has been confirmed by Netball South Africa in a media statement. Netball in the country had been brought to a halt on 08 January following a spike in Covid-19 cases in Mzansi. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement of new lockdown level three restrictions forced Netball SA to take the tough decision to suspend all planned activities until further notice. But with Ramaphosa recently announcing that the lockdown level three restrictions have been reviewed and relaxed,  Netball SA President Cecilia Molokwane and her Executive Committee decided that netball activities should resume. This decision was made after Molokwane and her Executive held several meetings to review the situation in the country having been in constant consultation with the relevant government departments. “The decision to resume netball activities was not an easy one, because we are still amid a pandemic and we needed to be very careful on how we will do things going forward,” said Molokwane in a statement. “This was a balancing act, because key to our list of priorities is ensuring that we preserve the lives of all our stakeholders whilst we play the sport we love. “As the Executive together with our Events and Compliance teams, we have put measures in place that will enable us to make sure that we protect the lives of everyone.” The first event that will take place is the SPAR Challenge which was supposed to happen at the beginning of the year. The participating teams will be the SPAR Proteas, the SA President’s XII, the SPAR Baby Proteas (under 21), Uganda’s She Cranes with Namibia yet to confirm participation. The tournament will happen in a biologically safe environment in Cape Town from the 24th to 31st of March 2021.
