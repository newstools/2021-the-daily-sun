CAR and business owners have been warned about the latest trick used by hijackers in Manguzi, northern KZN. According to police, hijackers do thorough research on car owners before luring them with work and hijacking them. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “Many people from different areas in and outside the province have been targeted. “The criminals target individuals in construction, carpentry and truck hire services.” She said criminals offer jobs to the individuals, especially those that own cars. Once the individual shows interest they’re sent to the “intended” destination. “On arrival, someone will be waiting to hijack them. The vehicles are allegedly taken to neighbouring countries,” said Mbele. She urged anyone with information that may lead the police to the perpetrators to contact their nearest police station, or CrimeStop on 08600 10111. Community Policing Forum chairman Joseph Ngubane said: “Such incidents have been brought to our attention. We ask people to be careful. If you get such a call, involve local police and ask them to accompany you to ensure your safety.” Victim Mandla Phiri from Bloemfontein, who’s in construction, was hijacked on 10 January. “I received a call from a man who said I needed to come to Manguzi and build cottages,” said Mandla. “He even sent me R1 000 via Shoprite for petrol. He also sent copies of his ID, so I was convinced the business call was genuine.” When he arrived in Jozini he met a man who said he was taking him to the owner of the site where cottages would be built. “Along the way the man pointed at another one, saying he was his uncle and asked that we give him a lift,” he said. “I stopped the car, and that’s when seven more armed men emerged and forcibly took it.” He was still traumatised by the incident.
