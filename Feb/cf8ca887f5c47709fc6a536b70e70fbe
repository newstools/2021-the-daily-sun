DYLAN Kerr has no doubt that Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) will survive relegation. The former Black Leopards and Baroka coach is currently assessing Vhadau VhaDamani while on the verge of joining them to succeed Joel Masutha, who was recently fired. And so far, he has been impressed with what he has seen in the team. All that is left now is for the club’s new owner, Abraham Sello, to agree on Kerr’s contract. The Englishman is expected to sign with TTM soon as the negotiations are believed to be at an advance stage and he’ll be on the bench when the Venda side, who were sold to Sello for R50 million two weeks ago, travel to Maritzburg United in their DStv Premiership clash at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday (5pm). “I am positive that this team will move from the position they are in as the confidence is back after their 1-0 win against SuperSport United in the Nedbank Cup last week,” said Kerr. “The other good thing is that from what I have seen so far at training, the boys are now happy because all the problems they had with the previous management have been solved. “They all have been paid their salaries and they can’t wait to work hard for this team. I’m pleased that I’ll be joining a happy team.” TTM had financial problems which forced former owner Masala Mulaudzi to accept Sello’s offer. Tshakhuma are currently second bottom with nine points, the same as bottom side Leopards and The Team of Choice, who are above both of them on a superior goal difference. In their 14 league games, the PSL rookies managed only one win under Masutha. They head to United without a league win in 10 consecutive matches. But Kerr is known for being able to rescue teams struggling in the relegation zone. He has rescued Leopards and Baroka. “I have watched them against SuperSport and they have a good team. I think if there was no financial problem, this team would have been up there in the log,” added Kerr.
