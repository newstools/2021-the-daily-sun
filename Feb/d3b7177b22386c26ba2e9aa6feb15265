THE North West High Court has dismissed Xander Bylsma’s application for leave to appeal against his convictions and sentence. Earlier this year, Bylsma was slapped with two life sentences for killing two teenage girls in 2018. On Friday, Judge Ronald Hendricks said having considered all grounds of appeal and carefully perusing the record and main judgement, he was of the view that no other court would come to a different decision. Following his conviction, Bylsma’s defence attorneys made an application for leave to appeal. The defence team therefore requested the judge to grant them leave to appeal and the case to be moved to the Supreme Court of Appeal. Hendricks sentenced Bylsma to life imprisonment on two counts of murder for strangulating and hanging Sharnelle Hough (17), and strangling her friend Marna Engelbrecht (16) who is said to be his relative. The bodies were discovered in May 2018 at Stella High School hostel Huis Esterhuizen where they were both attending. Evidence indicated that the murder was premeditated and driven by malice. According to court documents, the lifeless body of Hough was discovered hanging on the hostel stairs with a rope around her neck while Engelbrecht was found in the bathroom. Bylsma is expected to effectively start his jail term as per the sentence meted against him.
