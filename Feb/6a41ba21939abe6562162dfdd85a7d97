THE Department of Mineral Resources is concerned about the legal cases against mining company, Vantage Goldfields. Department officials and former mine workers visited the families of Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyirenda and Yvonne Mnisi on Thursday, 25 February, to give them updates on the latest developments. Mthokozisi Zondi, deputy chief inspector of mines, told Daily Sun the families and former workers agreed to meet frequently after a meeting in September to get updates on the business rescue process. “The latest we received from the business rescue practitioners is that Vantage Goldfield would refinance the mine, which means they’ll refund the opening of the mine themselves. According to the correspondence we received from them, they plan to reopen the mine by 2 July,” he said. Arqomanzi, a new investor, has since taken Vantage Goldfields and business rescue practitioners to court after they allegedly changed the business rescue plan without consulting them as they are one of the creditors. Zondi said they were concerned about the legal cases as they might delay the finalisation of the business process. “We will await the final decision of the court and then act,” he said. Family representative, Harry Mazibuko, said they were not interested in company procedures, court cases and business rescue processes, but the container that remained buried underground five years later. “We have prepared a letter to the minister which we gave to the officials. They agreed to get it to the minister. We continue to appeal to the minister of mineral resources to intervene in this issues of Lily Mine.” Vantage Goldfields CEO, Michael McChesney, said he was very disappointed in Arqomanzi’s action. “We are very disappointed that Arqomanzi has been making empty promises for years. We’re tired of it and want our companies out of business rescue. Arqomanzi don’t have the ability and they continue to bring the processes down,” he said
