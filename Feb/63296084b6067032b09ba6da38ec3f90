CONVICTED murderer Dumisani Mkhwanazi will learn his fate on Friday. Mkhwanazi is appearing at the Joburg High Court for sentencing after he was found guilty in December of killing and burying Palesa Madiba in 2013. After the guilty verdict, the Madiba family were seen for the first time being happy, even singing with joy. During the trial last year, Mkhwanaziâ€™s friend told the court that after a night of drinking, he told him he had crushed Palesa. Zwelakhe Mahlangu said that was after he asked him about her whereabouts as the news of her being missing were doing the rounds. The court found that Mkhwanazi was the last person to see Palesa as she was supposed to have left for campus on the day she was last seen at his home, where she had been visiting her friend Matshidiso Mkhwanazi. Handyman Justice Ndaba, who often did odd jobs at the Mkhwanazi home, said there was a heap of soil behind the rooms days after Palesa went missing. Her body was found three years later where Justice had said there was a heap of soil.
