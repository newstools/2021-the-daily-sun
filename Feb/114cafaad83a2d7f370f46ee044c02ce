DESPITE extending their lead at the top of the DStv Premiership standings, Mamelodi Sundowns have not yet reached the level required by co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi. Early this week after their Caf Champions League victory, the coach lamented the lack of a killer instinct. Against Baroka FC in a league match at Loftus Stadium last night, the Brazilians certainly lacked fire power as they only managed to 2-0 win, despite creating a plethora of goal scoring chances. Second half goals from Gaston Sirino just after the hour mark and Peter Shalulile, five minutes later, ensured the home team maintained their unbeaten run this season. Mngqithi admitted that it could have been better, by scoring more goals but it is work in progress. Downs remain at the top of the standings with 36 points from 16 matches. They restored the five-point gap between themselves and SuperSport United who are second with 31 points. Baroka ended the game strongly, but could find no way past Onyango despite creating a handful of presentable chances in the dying minutes.Baroka will be back in DStv Premiership action on Saturday with a Limpopo derby against Black Leopards, while Sundownsâ€™ scheduled match against Maritzburg United has been delayed to aid their travel arrangements for a CAF Champions League clash away in Algeria on Tuesday.
