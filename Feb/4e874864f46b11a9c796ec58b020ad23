INSPIRED by the way his late brother communicated with him spiritually, up-and-coming actor and playwright Sandile Dladla has written a play titled Tau and Neo. Sandile, who played Romeo on the Zulu version of Romeo and Juliet staged at the Durban University of Technology last year, said the play is dedicated to his late brother Neo. Neo died in a car accident in 2012. The play is also aimed at teaching people to listen to the ancestors when they order them to do something for them. The 21-year-old third-year drama student at DUT told SunBuzz dead people are alive spiritually. “I want people to learn more about what I learned from my late brother,” he said.

The two-man play is directed by Siyabonga Msibi. It will show at KCap in KwaMashu during the Isigcawu and Insika festivals. The play will also show at the Stable Theatre in Durban during the Imbewu Festival. “We’re still in talks with the Market Theatre because we want to perform at the theatre in April, if everything goes well,” said Sandile. “We’ll perform the show at the Durban Playhouse during the Community Art Festival in August.”
