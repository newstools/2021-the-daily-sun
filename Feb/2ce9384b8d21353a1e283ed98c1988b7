HE WAS found guilty of sexual misconduct involving pupils and dismissed. But he managed to crawl back into teaching and landed a deputy principal position! According to a source, the teacher has yet again been accused of misconduct and has been placed on special leave. In 2014, the teacher from Mohlakeng on the West Rand, whose name is known to Daily Sun, was found guilty of seven counts of sexual misconduct by the Gauteng Department of Education. It has now emerged that he was appointed deputy principal at another school in Kagiso. In his dismissal documents, the 50-year-old is accused of sexually assaulting a pupil and telling others he wanted to poke them. The documents state he was accused of telling pupils they had sexy legs and looked like they would be good in bed. He lodged an appeal, but it was dismissed.

However, it was unclear whether he was listed on the National Register for Sex Offenders as is required. Education department spokesman Steve Mabona said: “He was indeed dismissed from his teaching duties at Phahama Secondary School in 2014 due to allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct.  Mabona said on Wednesday, 10 February, the department had a meeting with the school to discuss the matter further. “Subsequently, the school resolved to put the teacher on precautionary special leave while resolving the matter. We’re monitoring this matter with keen interest,” he said.
