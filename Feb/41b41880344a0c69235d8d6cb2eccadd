GOLDEN Arrows coach Mandla Ncikazi has admitted that conceding a late injury time second half goal against AmaZulu was a knockout blow for his players. Arrows crashed out of the Nedbank Cup at the hands of Usuthu losing 5-4 on penalties after the game ended 1-1, and when the teams couldn’t score in extra time in their last-32 round game at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday. A disappointed Ncikazi said as soon as AmaZulu scored the equaliser, he knew it was over for his side. It meant Arrows once again bowed out in the first round of the Ke Yona Cup for the second successive season. “The biggest setback was conceding in the last minute of the game,” said Ncikazi, whose side also finished the game with a man down after Ntsako Makhubela was sent off. “We never recovered from that. I never saw my team with the same energy (after the equaliser). It was not the best brand of football in the second half and I feel for the boys. I hope we will learn from this when we prepare for our upcoming league matches.” Despite this setback, it has been a good start to the season for Ncikazi and Abafana Bes’Thende. They are perched fourth in the DStv Premiership table with 25 points from 14 games. They went on a record run of 11 league unbeaten games before that was ended by Cape Town City late last month. Ncikazi said his boys should learn not to drop their guards mentally. “They need to know that after a setback like that (to concede late), you still have to come back and win the match,” said Ncikazi.
