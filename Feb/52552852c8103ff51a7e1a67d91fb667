Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a taxi owner (34) was gunned down after he parked his Toyota Quantum at the home of a motor mechanic on Thursday, 11 February. “An armed man emerged out of nowhere and fired a shot at the victim. He then fled the scene,” said Hlathi.

A case of murder was opened.” In the second incident, a taxi owner’s family came under attack in Barberton on Thursday, 11 February. This after suspects opened fire at his house. But fortunately, no one was injured during the incident. “Police were informed and a case of attempted murder was opened,” Hlathi said. “Preliminary investigations suggest the suspects had targeted the taxi owner, who was not home at the time of incident,” he said.
