RESIDENTS of Mooiplaas near Centurion in Tshwane were recently left in shock. Two coffins were found in the bushes nearby! What scared them was that they suspected the coffins had been dug up. Makhosini Nkosi, one of the residents who found the coffins, said he initially feared there might be bodies inside. “When I got closer I was relieved to discover they were empty. But I was still worried about how they got there.” Makhosini, Sanco chairman in Region 4, said they suspected the coffins had been in the bushes for more than a week. “In African culture, coffins are respected as they carry dead bodies. “The people who did this are disrespecting our culture.” Funeral Industry Reformed Association chairman Johan Rousseau advised residents to call the police for a proper forensic test. He urged them not to touch the coffins as they could get infected. “The coffins could have been dumped and emptied by people who use muthi,” he said. Funeral undertaker Edith Simelane said: “That person must be arrested. Dumping coffins will cause tension between us and our clients.” Another undertaker, Mmusi Motaung, said this was disrespectful, adding that such people should face the full might of the law. “The coffins must be traced and the makers should tell the police who bought them.” Sangoma Thulani Mabena said coffins are bad luck and urged those who saw them to be cleansed. “People who normally do such do so for ritual purposes.”
