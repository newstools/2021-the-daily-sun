SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo is delighted with the progress of striker Evans Rusike following his return from injury. The Zimbabwean forward is working his way back to full match fitness having missed a chunk of United’s matches this season. He has made two appearances as a substitute since his return and is slowly getting back to his best.He made his return in their 1-1 draw with Swallows FC and also got a run out in their 1-0 loss to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in the Nedbank Cup. Tembo is happy to have his compatriot back as an option to further boost what is already a lethal attack. Rusike will be expected to share the scoring burden with the league’s top scorer Bradley Grobler and the ever hard-working Thamsanqa Gabuza. “Evans was out for quite some time so he is not ready to play 90 minutes just yet,” said Tembo. “But I think he brings a lot of energy to our attack. He’s a player who tries to run behind the defence and that’s a different option. “He can cause the opponent a lot of problems. He just lacks a bit of match fitness at the moment because he’s been out for a very long time.“But we will try to bring him in gradually, he has got a few minutes under his belt in the last two matches. “He might be ready to start the next match for us.” SuperSport, who were booted out of the Ke Yona Cup by TTM, will now focus on DStv Premiership. Tembo’s charges have their sights on the league title this season and they resume their mission with a clash against Bloemfontein Celtic tomorrow (3 pm) at Dr Molemela Stadium.
