IT’S not every day that cops inspect a taxi and find the passengers are not people. That’s what happened on a routine patrol in Zonkizizwe, Ekurhuleni. Police found 30 sheep and goats, and two firearms, leading to the arrest of suspects on Tuesday. Cops came across a suspicious red Toyota Quantum with two occupants. Captain Kay Makhubele said cops stopped the vehicle at about 2.30am and found two illegal firearms and 10 goats after searching the taxi. According to Makhubele, the suspects led police to their accomplices, where 10 goats and 10 sheep were recovered.  “On arrival, three suspects were found with other livestock,” he said. Makhubele said the three suspects noticed their friends were accompanied by police and started shooting at them. “Police returned fire and one suspect was shot and killed, while one officer was injured and taken to hospital,” he said. The injured officer is in a stable condition. “Two suspects fled and police have launched a manhunt. An investigation is under way to establish if the arrested suspects and weapons can be linked to other crimes.” The arrested suspects will appear in court soon.
