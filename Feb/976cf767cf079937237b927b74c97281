HE started playing with R50, but had R720 by the time he was about to leave. However, other gamblers were jealous he was beating them in the card game and taking all their money. So they demanded it back. But John Kwasa (28) from Tambo section in Bekkersdal didn’t want to give it back. A fight ensued and it got so bad he was thrown to the ground and some of the gamblers went straight for his pockets and took all the money he won. An angry John then went to the police station to open a case against them and cops are now looking for the suspects. John, who’s a recycler, said he usually gambled to supplement his income. “It’s sad that some people are hooligans and don’t take defeat with grace. They rather resort to violence,” he said. “I had to fight for what was mine. I didn’t rob them. I won fair and square.” John’s eye was injured during the fight and he showed it to the police. “I just want to teach them a lesson. I was planing to buy things for my aunt’s children when schools reopen on Monday. “I didn’t want to squander money on useless things. My heart is sore because I won’t be able to help my nieces and nephews,” he said. A case of robbery and assault was opened at Bekkerdal Police Station.
