ATCHAR has changed Patrick Berry’s life. The 34-year-old from Nellmapius in Tshwane has his own atchar business called Monna Ke Pan. He goes around the kasi with his atchar trolley attached to a four-wheeled motorbike and sells to small businesses like spazas. Patrick told Daily Sun that since he started the business, he no longer went to bed hungry. “The most beautiful thing about my business is that most of my customers come from the same kasi as me. I’m now a funny man to children because they laugh at my trolley. I love it because I’m recognised everywhere,” he said.  Patrick said he to started selling atchar because people ate it almost every day. He said he started his business in 2012 and sold in containers of up to 20kg. “People love my atchar and they say it’s delicious,” he said. To make atchar, the father of one said he bought raw mangoes, oil, spices and other ingredients. He said it was difficult to make atchar. Patrick said he worked on his own but was hoping to employ two people to assist him. He said before he handed over atchar to a customer, he made sure to sanitise their hands first. Customer Golden Maphanga (38) said Patrick’s atchar is the best. “I buy the atchar and sell at my spaza,” he said. Golden said Patrick passed his shop in the morning with a trolley full of stock and came back sold out in the afternoon.
