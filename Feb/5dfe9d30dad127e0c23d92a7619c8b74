Actor Aubrey Poo has landed a big role on SABC3’s newest telenovela, The Estate. The actor will play the role of Castro. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said: “I was really excited when I was told I got the role. I believe it came at the right time. It’s a blessing actually because it came just as it was announced that Isibaya is being canned. This means continuous employment for me.” Aubrey said his character is a villain. “Castro is very dark. Playing a character like him is interesting because viewers tend to love to hate such characters,” he said.

The subject matters that are dealt are things that are topical to many South Africans. “These are human issues that are very present in the South African socio-economic landscape as many of them grapple with issues of land disposition and wealth. “The show is going to resonate with the viewers because, one way or another, many of us have come across such issues.” Aubrey shared how his journey has been like and how he’s managed to have a longstanding career in the entertainment industry. “Because we’re not like America where you can focus on one thing and be able to make a killing, I believe diversity is important. “I have this longstanding career that I have today because I was able to diversify myself and learn languages.”
