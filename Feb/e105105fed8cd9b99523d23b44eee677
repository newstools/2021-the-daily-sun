INSTEAD of being called on to pray for the flock of God, Pastor Wiseman Nazo is receiving calls from people asking him to rescue them from the stench coming from the rubbish and the sewage. Pastor Wiseman of the Atteridgeville Saulsville Pastoral Association in Jeffesville, Tshwane, told Daily Sun he’s a respected man of the cloth but he can’t help the community with the piled up rubbish in front of him and in the community. He said the smell coming from the rubbish and sewage water is unbearable. “My phone doesn’t stop ringing, with people telling me about the rubbish,” he said. “My job is to bring people close to God, not to protect them from flies.” He said it’s difficult to walk in the streets because of the piled up rubbish. “The stench is chasing away our visitors from the kasi and we are worried about people getting sick,” he said. He said the Makhaza Sports Ground is flooded with dirty water and it’s difficult for them to host football teams. Community leader Samuel Masilela said they needed storm water drains to keep their kasi clean. “The state of our grounds has chased away our youth who are now addicted to drugs and alcohol,” he said. City of Tshwane acting chief of staff, Jordan Griffiths said the city has a process to ensure that they clear areas where illegal dumping is taking place. He said, to date they have cleared over 2 000 illegal dumping sites and the municipality has issued multiple fines to those caught dumping. “Residents are encouraged to report illegal dumping to TMPDComplaints@tshwane.gov.za.
