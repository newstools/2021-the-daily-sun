AS reported by SunSport, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) star Mogakolodi Ngele is back in Venda. The 30-year-old midfielder was expected to join the rest of his teammates at their training ground at Louis Trichardt High School yesterday. The former Mamelodi Sundowns player had originally refused to return from his home in Botswana since the festive holidays as he wanted to be paid the outstanding salaries the club owed him. But Ditonkana Sello, who bought Tshakhuma for R50 million from Masala Mulaudzi last week, appears to have solved the Botswana international’s problem with club. “He (Ngele) is back which is a good news for us,” said under-pressure coach Joel Masutha. “Ngele is important to the team and we missed him. He has been doing well since he joined us at the beginning of the season. I am happy to have him back. We need all the players as we have to fight and move from the relegation zone.” The only concern for Ngele will be his fitness as he has not played a competitive game this year for Tshakhuma. Since joined Vhadau VhaDamani from Black Leopards this season, Ngele played five league games and scored one goal. However, Ngele is unlikely to be ready when TTM host SuperSport United in their Nedbank Cup last-32 clash at Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow (5pm). Ngele has missed seven consecutive league matches for Tshakhuma while staying in Gaborone. Meanwhile, Masutha’s team received another huge boost ahead of their clash against Matsatsantsa a Pitori with the return of their trusted and veteran defender Alfred Ndengane. The former Orlando Pirates player missed Tshakhuma’s two DStv Premiership defeats against United and Bloemfontein Celtic due to suspension. The last time Ndengane played for Tshakhuma was two weeks ago in their 3-0 defeat to Kaizer Chiefs where he received a red card.
