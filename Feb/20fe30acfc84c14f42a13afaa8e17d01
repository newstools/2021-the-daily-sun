A SHOCKING surprise awaited the Selapa family at the graveyard on Friday, 2 January. They found that two of their loved one’s tombstones were stolen. Sello Selapa (45) from Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo said someone told him the fence at the graveyard was tampered with. He said they then went to the graveyard to inspect the damage. “We were very shocked when we found that two of our loved ones’ tombstones were stolen. “The structure protecting the graveyard was also stolen. “We suspect the tombstones were stolen a few days ago because we saw footprints. We don’t know who could have done this,” he said. Sello said they tried to follow the footprints, but did not get anywhere. “They stole my younger sister’s tombstone as well as my cousin’s. “We erected the tombstones in 2018. The graveyard is full of graves. We don’t know why they specifically targeted these ones,” he said. He said the tombstones cost more than R20 000. Sello said he believes their loved ones will no longer rest in peace as they were disrespected. “It’s unusual for tombstones to get stolen. It’s the first time we witness this. We don’t know if they were stolen by jealous people who are going to perform evil deeds or sell them,” he said. The family opened a case and appealed to SunReaders who may have been approached by people selling tombstones to alert the police. “Those who did this will not find peace. Our ancestors will deal with them because they disturbed their peace,” said Sello.
