SOUTH Africa Under-17 coach Vela
Khumalo has a mountain to climb. Khumalo will be hoping his side
get out of their tough Group B where they were pitted against reigning
champions Cameroon, Senegal and Mali. The draw for the 2021 U-17 Afcon
which saw Amajimbos drawn in what is definitely the “group of death” against a
wholly West African opposition was held on Wednesday. The tournament is billed to take
place in Morocco, Casablanca from 13-31 March. Khumalo says he believes that
the group will test his lads’ ability. Khumalo said: “Cameroon are the
current title holders and we are fortunate to have their recordings of their build
up to the Afcon. “Senegal and Mali are very
physical teams, which will force us to really work hard on our ball possession.
However, we will continue studying the style of play now that the draw has been
concluded. ‘’I am looking forward to the
challenge. We will ensure that we raise the country’s flag high.” Amajimbos will be reporting for
their final home camp this Friday, before heading to Casablanca for their
opening matches of the youth tournament. The Under-17 Afcon is normally
used as a qualifier for the Fifa Under-17 World Cup. However, this year’s
edition will be different due to the current world pandemic Covid-19. Fifa has decided to cancel the
World Cup tournament. Hosts Morocco are in Group A
alongside Uganda, Zambia and Ivory Coast, while the highest ranked African side
Nigeria will form part of Group B against Tanzania, Algeria and Congo.
