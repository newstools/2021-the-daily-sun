A MOTORIST drove into a ditch and dumped his car to avoid an Operation Okae Molao road block on Saturday night. Over the weekend, police left no stone unturned when they patrolled Olifantsfontein Road in Midrand, Gauteng, which connects to the N1. Several arrests were made, among them a driver who tried to dump his car and flee. Police Minister Bheki Cele, who joined the operation, told Daily Sun: “We had five of these road blocks in Gauteng. “We started during the day after Premier David Makhura handed over 65 high-performance cars. “Here we’ve found 12 drunk drivers, more than 20 illegal immigrants, two cars that seem to have been interfered with, and the motorist who tried to dump his car and flee.” Cele said the BMW 3 series cars handed over to police would be used in dealing with high-priority crimes such as hijackings and heists. GBV was also prioritised as 11 of the cars were given to units dealing with those matters. The new vehicles would help the police detect stolen cars. “There’s state of the art technology in these vehicles to help us with that particular crime,” he said during the handover the Buccleuch Interchange.  Cele also spoke about the disturbing new crime stats, which showed rape cases had skyrocketed in the past three months. “In three months, 12 000 women were raped and 129 South Africans were given life sentences. That shows you efforts are being made,” he said. “The answer to these problems is prevention because it doesn’t mean much when you get a life sentence after someone has already been raped and murdered.”
