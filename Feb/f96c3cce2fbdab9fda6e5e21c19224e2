The spreading of fake news about the Covid-19 vaccine before it landed prompted President Cyril Ramaphosa to say no one will be forced to vaccinate. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng’s utterances must have made many people doubt the legitimacy of the vaccines. The president went on to say no one will be forbidden to take part in public activities if they’re not vaccinated. Although under pressure from negative people, it’s somewhat wrong for Ramaphosa to say no one will be forced to vaccinate. We’re one nation battling the pandemic. If half of the nation refuse to take the vaccine, that means the coronavirus will still be in our midst for years to come. If people who’re not vaccinated continue to be infected with the coronavirus, we can’t say we have defeated the pandemic even if the majority are immune. It could be better if government made it compulsory for people to be vaccinated. If they can put it that way, only a few would abstain from it. My deepest wish is that the president reconsiders what he said about the choice to be vaccinated. We should encourage one another as a nation to take the vaccine.
