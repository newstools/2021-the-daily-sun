Reigning Miss South Africa Shudufhadzo Musida has opened up her heart and pockets. The Limpopo-born beauty queen, who’ll be representing Mzansi in the Miss World pageant later this year, recently visited the Khayalethu Youth Centre in Gqeberha, formerly Port Elizabeth. Shudu, who also recently kicked off her mental awareness campaign, donated shoes, blankets, sanitisers and other items to the children at the centre. “These little guys are going back to school and I’m honoured to be part of The Boardwalk’s Back to School programme at Khayalethu Youth Centre,” she wrote on Twitter. “South Africa’s future is in great hands. S/O to mama Peggy for leaving the Pegacy behind.” ALSO READ | TOP UZALO ACTOR LOSES HIS VOICE At the handover, Shudu told the SABC this is a cause dear to her heart. “I think it sets a good example for our society in general. I mean Khayalethu cultivates young men and teaches them respect, kindness and just to be responsible,” she said. “I think it’s not just important to do this here but all over the country. And for me personally, I’d love to live a life of service. “So to see people be of service to society, to see people be of service to their community is such an amazing inspiration to me.”
