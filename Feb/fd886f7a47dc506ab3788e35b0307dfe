TWO men were arrested for possession of drugs estimated to the street value of R3,4 million at the Lebombo Port of entry in Komatipoort. The suspects, aged 24 and 44, had appeared before Komatipoort Magistrates Court on Thursday, 4 February, but are in police custody until 9 February for formal bail hearing. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the suspects were arrested in Komatipoort by members of the SAPS Border Policing and Custom Officials while conducting routine stop and searches at the gate on Wednesday. “The members stopped a Toyota Dyna truck with the said occupants. Upon searching it, they found drugs valued at R3,4 million stashed inside bags of potatoes. “They were allegedly travelling from Mozambique to Gauteng with the contraband. The truck was also confiscated as it was reportedly used in the commission of crime. The case was postponed to 9 February where they are expected to apply for bail,” he said. Meanwhile, the Hawks has taken over the investigation as per its mandate, he added.
