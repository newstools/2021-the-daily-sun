UMKHANYAKUDE District Municipality in KZN has been placed under administration. Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka said this was to ensure good governance, sound financial management and efficient service delivery. “Residents rightly expect a well-run entity, but what they actually see leaves a lot to be desired,” he said yesterday. “It’s therefore our duty, following the resolution of the provincial executive, to make an important announcement before this council regarding the immediate future of this municipality.” The municipality was previously placed under administration in October 2015. According to Hlomuka, it had been limping from one problem to another. “There were persistent governance, financial and service delivery challenges the municipality was unable to resolve,” said Hlomuka. “This was despite support from the provincial and national governments.” He said at the time the municipality made good progress in all key performance areas that informed the decision of the provincial executive to intervene in 2015. “As a result, the provincial executive terminated the intervention in November 2017,” said Hlomuka. “Years later, it appears the municipality has slipped back into instability and dysfunctionality.” Internal divisions were the reason the municipality failed to convene council for three straight scheduled meetings. “The municipality has also failed to prevent unauthorised, irregular and wasteful expenditure, and this council has failed to investigate such expenditure.” Hlomuka toldthe People’s Paper an administrator would then prepare and implement a recovery plan to address all the challenges.
