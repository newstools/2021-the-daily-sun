CASTER Semenya has taken her fight against the World Athletics to the European Court of Human Rights. In a statement yesterday, the 400m and 800m specialist said this fight is not just about her, "it's about taking a stand and fighting for dignity, equality and the human rights for women in sport". She wrote: "All we ask is to be able to run free as the strong and fearless women we are. Thank you to all of those who have stood behind me." This is as she takes a crucial step in a fight for dignity, equality and be allowed to compete in events that she has been prohibited. The Switzerland's supreme court dismissed Semenya's appeal against a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruling last year following the ban imposed by the World Athletics, unless, the court argued, she races only if she takes testosterone-reducing drugs. "Caster asks the Court to find that Switzerland has failed in its positive obligations to protect her against the violation of her rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. This is as a result of World Athletics' continuing discriminatory attempts to restrict the ability of certain women to participate in female athletics competitions," read the statement from her lawyers. The top world female athlete said she had hoped the European court will put an end to the longstanding human rights violations by World Athletics. "All we ask is to be allowed to run free, for once and for all, as the strong and fearless women we are and have always been." This fight is not just about me, it's about taking a stand and fighting for dignity, equality and the human rights of women in sport. All we ask is to be able to run free as the strong and fearless women we are!! Thank you to all of those who have stood behind me??? pic.twitter.com/0PdBiujH8b
