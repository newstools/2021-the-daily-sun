THE closing down of Musica has left many artists very worried. The group announced that due to declining sales and the effects of the pandemic, it has decided to shut down its stores in May. Brenden Maseko of Open Mic Productions told Daily Sun the closure took them by surprise. “We still produce CDs for our artists. There are still diehard music lovers who collect CDs,” he said. “The music industry is already suffering. This is another hard knock to the music industry because many people are going to lose their jobs.” He said they didn’t entirely agree with the decision to close the stores. “But all we can do now is to go back to the old ways of selling CDs ourselves, probably at events when things are back to normal,” said Brenden. Veteran music distributor, Kingsley Khumalo, said Musica has always been known as a destination store. “This will fuel the piracy rate, which will lead to more suffering for artists.” Music sensation Big Zulu, who’s set to release his album, said this is a huge knock to the music industry.  Maskandi musician Khuzani Mpungose told the People’s Paper he was heartbroken because his fans prefer physical recordings of his music. “It makes me wonder what’s next for the industry. We’ve taken so many knocks since the pandemic started,” he said. “It’s a wake-up call for fans to familiarise themselves with the digital stores.” He said he’s lucky to have stores where he distributes his music himself. Gospel sensation Butho Vuthela said he’s just released an album. “I think it’s time government steps in and helps us establish our own stores,” he said. “My album is in demand but now people can’t get the physical disc anymore.” He said he will courier the disc to fans. “But it’s expensive,” he told the People’s Paper.
