THE Ghana Football Association have reportedly written a letter to the Confederation of African Football (Caf), requesting that their Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifying match against Bafana Bafana next month in Mzansi be moved to a neutral venue. According to a SunSport source, the Black Stars’ concerns are due to the spike in Covid-19 cases in South Africa. Ghana are now waiting for Caf’s response. Bafana, who lost to Ghana in the opening match of the Afcon qualifiers in Cape Coast in October 2019, are scheduled to host the West African country onat FNB Stadium 25 March. After playing Ghana, Bafana will complete their qualifying programme against Sudan in Khartoum three days later. Safa head of communications Dominic Chimhavi said Safa have not received any communication from either Caf or the GFA about this request. “We communicate with the GFA, not stories from the media. We see the story in newspapers in Ghana. “So from our side, we will deal with Ghana FA, not the media,” said Chimhavi. SunSport understands that this is a ploy from Ghana to put pressure on Caf so that the game can be played elsewhere to deny Bafana home ground advantage. Bafana and Ghana are tied on nine points at the top of the Group C standings after four matches. Sudan are in third position with six points, whereas Sao Tome and Principe languish at the bottom of the group with no win, and cannot qualify. In a similar matter, Bloemfontein Celtic were denied entry by the Nigerian authorities to play Rivers FC in the second leg, first round of the Caf Confederation Cup earlier this year. The match was played in Benin on 23 January and Celtic lost 3-0 (5-0 on aggregate). Kaizer Chiefs have also been denied entry by Moroccan health ministry to play their Caf Champions League group stage match against Wydad Casablanca on Saturday. The Moroccan FA said the game should be postponed or played at a neutral venue.
