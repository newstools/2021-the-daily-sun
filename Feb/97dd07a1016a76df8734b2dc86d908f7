A TRUCK driver has died after losing control of his double-trailer truck, crashing on pillars of a bridge in Cape Town earlier on Saturday, 13 February. According to Department of Transport spokesman Jandré Bakker, the truck crashed just after 5am. Eyewitnesses said the truck, with double trailers, started swaying on the road before the driver lost control and crashed into the bridge between Klapmuts and Klipheuwel turn-offs.  “Shortly after 5am, a heavy motor vehicle was involved in a single-car crash. The truck left the roadway and crashed against bridge support. The driver was trapped and later declared dead. Traffic was considerably delayed as the road had to be closed in order to first secure the scene and later complete the recovery,” said Bakker. Western Cape health Emergency Medical Services (EMS) spokeswoman Deanna Bessick said they responded to the incident after receiving a call at 05.12am. “The driver was on his way to Cape Town when the incident occurred. Bystanders witnessed the truck swaying, eventually driving off the road and crashing into a bridge on the side of the road. Unfortunately, the driver died at the scene. EMS had to use the jaws of life to extricate the patient. A crane and two rescue vehicles assisted with the operation,” said Bessick. Last month, a truck carrying 80 workers crashed and injured many people in the Klapmuts area. “Our thoughts go out to the family of the deceased,” said Bakker.
