THE EFF has condemned the move by President Cyril Ramaphosa to lift the booze sales ban. The Red Berets said Ramaphosa was trying to please business. In a statement, the party said it was irresponsible to lift the ban after the arrival of only one million dozes of the Covid-19 vaccine. The EFF said there’s evidence that links booze to the increase in the spread of the virus. This, the party said, overburdens the healthcare system. “The reopening of alcohol distribution and sale is reckless, and Ramaphosa is doing so to please the alcohol manufacturing capitalist establishment, which has been threatening our country with disinvestment due to the correct decision to curtail the free flow of alcohol. “Ramaphosa opens the sale of alcohol on the day a meagre one million vaccine doses arrive in South Africa, as if that’s enough to insulate more than 58 million people,” said the Red Berets. “One million doses is not even a drop in the ocean of 58 million people, particularly with the unreliability and undependability of Ramaphosa’s administration to fulfil its commitments.” The EFF said allowing provinces to distribute the vaccine would lead to another looting spree. Meanwhile, the DA welcomed the unbanning of alcohol and reopening of beaches. “DA welcomes the lifting of the nonsensical beach ban and the easing of alcohol restrictions and curfew. “However, these come too late to save hundreds of thousands of jobs and businesses in the tourism, restaurant and alcohol industries, which have been needlessly destroyed by our indiscriminate state. ANC politicians should pay with their jobs.”
