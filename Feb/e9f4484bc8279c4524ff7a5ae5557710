ITUMELENG Khune has a chance to redeem himself. This after Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt decided to retain the stopper in goal for their clash against SuperSport United. The match takes place at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Khune has been error prone of late, costing his side dearly. The latest of his mistakes came in Chiefs' 2-1 loss to AmaZulu midweek. Khune came off his line in an attempt to punch a corner but he was unable to connect properly‚ allowing substitute Lehlohonolo Majoro to spoon in Usuthu’s winner. This season Khune has conceded 12 goals in his six starts in the league‚ with a number of those coming from his individual errors. READ: WATCH: ITUMELENG KHUNE'S HORRIFIC BLUNDERS! But despite his struggles, Hunt has decided to persist with the former Mzansi number one. Daniel Akpeyi, who has been the number one keeper for Chiefs for the bulk of the season, continues to play second fiddle. His performances have also not been the strongest, leaving Hunt with a goalkeeping problem.
