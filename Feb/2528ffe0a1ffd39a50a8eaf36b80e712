KZN has warmly welcomed the arrival of vaccines. Giving an update on the Covid-19 situation in the province, Premier Sihle Zikalala said: “KZN had the first case of Covid-19 and many people died, especially in the second wave. “But as the vaccines have finally arrived in the country, we’re very pleased. The vaccine will arrive in Durban on the 14th of this month.” He was speaking during a media briefing held in Mayville, Durban. The premier said a vaccination committee had been formed and there would be 91 sites. “We also have a distribution plan. Vaccinations will be given to nurses in both private and public hospitals,” he said. “Those who’re vaccinated will be monitored in case there are complications.” The premier said the number of cases in KZN had gone down and the province was ready for government schools to open on 15 February. “The education department has made sure that Covid-19 essentials arrive at schools before pupils come back. Schools will not run out of water,” he said. The department had set up a committee that would assist pupils who hadn’t been admitted to any schools. “The schools that were damaged by the rain during the holidays are being attended to,” he said. “Vacant posts of teachers and principals who died due to Covid-19 complications have been filled.” He was accompanied by Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu and Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu.
