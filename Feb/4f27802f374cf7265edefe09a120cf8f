RASTA The Painter is working on a painting of former president Jacob Zuma and EFF leader Julius Malema drinking tea. But he said he can’t finish it because he needs paint. Rasta said he feels this painting will be his breakthrough. “As soon as I buy paint, I will be able to finish the drawing. I’m happy about this painting because people are positive towards it. It’s quite an important picture of two big people in South Africa. I hope the picture ends up in either former president Zuma’s house or Mr Malema’s house,” he said. Malema responded to the painting and said people must alert him once Rasta’s finished. ALSO READ | LUCKY DUBE BACK TO LIFE “Let me prepare myself. Today I’m breaking someone’s jaws. Please alert me when he is done,” he wrote on Facebook. On Monday, 8 February, Rasta took to Facebook to ask people to help him as he’s running out of paint. “It’s been a very busy 2021 with us losing our beloved ones and public figures, as a result, I’ve officially run out of paint. Please DM for donations,” he wrote. Speaking to Daily Sun, Rasta said he needs about R1 500 to buy all the paint he needs. “I need at least six colours of the South African flag – blue, red, black, yellow, white and green. All these will cost me R1 500. So far, I’ve got R300 from donations and some have promised to donate,” he said. ALSO READ | TOP ACTOR JOINS UZALO!
