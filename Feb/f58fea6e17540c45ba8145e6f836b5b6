RESPONDING to a domestic violence case, two officers accompanied the victim home. But a shot was fired from the woman’s house in Welbedacht East in Chatsworth on Thursday last week, which struck Constable Mfihloyakhe Ndlovu (45) in the upper body, killing him. The shooter then ran out of the house, firing randomly. The other constable fired back, fatally wounding the suspect. Acting Community Safety MEC Kwazi Mshengu visited Ndlovu’s home in KwaXimba in Durban on Saturday. He warned thugs that police would not hesitate to use deadly force if their lives were threatened. “Police must not die with their guns in their hands. Police must not be tolerant of criminals because when criminals draw their guns, their intention is clear and that is to kill police. “Our message to police is that when faced with hardened criminals or anyone who points a gun at them, they must not hesitate to defend themselves and their communities,” he said. Mshengu described Ndlovu as a dedicated cop who died in the line of duty.  “We’re saddened that we continue to lose experienced police officers at the hands of criminals. The killing of police officers needs to be confronted by all of us because it’s a direct attack on the state and rule of law.” Mshengu expressed his deepest condolences to Ndlovu’s family. The constable will be buried on Sunday, 28 February. Ndlovu’s brother, Mqondisi (51), said they were saddened by his sudden death. He said they were comforted by the fact that he died doing what he loved the most: protecting vulnerable people. “He was a brother to me, husband to his wife and father to his child. We will miss him,” he said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the shooting.
