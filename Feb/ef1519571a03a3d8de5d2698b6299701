Life mimicked the arts for Ayanda Daweti, who plays Chumani on popular e.tv soapie Scandal! His character was checked into a mental facility for psychiatric evaluation, and that’s exactly what he needed in real life. The talented actor told Daily Sun he was on the brink of a mental breakdown. This was caused by hectic scenes he had to play, for which he was lauded by the show’s viewers for an excellent portrayal of his character. The star almost lost his mind because of the intense scenes involving the murder of his on-screen father. “I’d changed completely. I wasn’t the same person. The storyline I was doing was emotionally and mentally draining. “I only realised I was going through a mental breakdown after I started changing when I was with family and friends.
