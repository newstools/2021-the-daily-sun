country that will conclude the international summer for the Proteas. The tour is scheduled to run
from 02 April to 16 April 2021, with the subcontinent side arriving in South
Africa on 26 March prior to the first game when they will enter a bio-secure
environment (BSE) in Gauteng. They will go into a period of
quarantine before commencing with inter-squad training. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)
has agreed to a request by CSA to play an additional Twenty20 International,
meaning the tour will now comprise of three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and
four T20Is with the games played in Centurion, SuperSport Park and
Johannesburg, Wanderers Stadium. “We are delighted to finally
confirm the dates and full schedule for Pakistan’s white-ball tour to South
Africa,” said CSA Director of Cricket Graeme Smith. “Pakistan has proved their
status over the years as one of the most dangerous limited-overs teams and I’m
sure they will give the Proteas a stern test on the Highveld. “We will also have the
much-anticipated ‘Pink ODI’ take place during the tour and that is something
further to look forward to for the players, the fans and all those associated
with this iconic day.” Schedule: 02 April at 10am: 1st ODI (CWCSL) South Africa v
