 Police have arrested the husband of Lesedi FM's current
affairs presenter, Mackenzie Ratselane. Mackenzie allegedly brutally attacked and stabbed his wife
Dimakatso Ratselane in Mangaung on Thursday. After several attempts to get into contact with Mackenzie,
the police took the investigation to another level and obtained a warrant of
arrest. He was then regarded as a suspect on the run. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said that police
finally caught up with the 39-year-old husband of Dimakatso who was on the run. "Within 24 hours after his warrant of arrest was
issued, the team worked around the clock following all leads until the early
hours of Tuesday morning when they followed intelligence-driven information
which led them to the house in Gauteng Province. "The Free State team supported by the Soweto flying
squad went to a house in Ennerdale, south of Joburg where they found the
suspect in hiding. He was taken into police custody." Dimakatso was found by residents of Dinaweng, covered in
blood because of the multiple stab wounds she had sustained. According to preliminary investigations conducted, Mackenzie
was the last person suspected to have been with her before she sustained these
injuries. She was sent to Pelonomi Hospital where she received
treatment.
