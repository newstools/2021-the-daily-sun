DESPITE recent heavy rain that led to floods in the Free State, residents are still without water. Residents in Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality said they did not understand how they were without water when dams were filled to capacity. They said they were subjected to waiting days before they got water from the municipality. But the municipality claimed it provided the community with water tanks. Pule Mokoena (43) from Mabolela Village said the water crisis was man-made. “Politicians are fighting their battles at our expense. They are making a lot of money from the so-called Maluti-a-Phofung water crisis. We have been struggling without water for some time,” said Pule. Speaking to Daily Sun, Free State Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Thembeni Ngcangisa said old infrastructure, malfunctioning water treatment plants and damaged water pipes were the main cause of the current situation. Ngcangisa met Maluti-a-Phofung Mayor Masetjhaba Mosia-Lakaje, the Department of Water and Sanitation and Sedibeng Water on Wednesday to find a way to address the situation. “The indication here says there are 59 boreholes that are equipped and already providing water to some of the areas, including projects that are currently underway, while 20 boreholes are in the pipeline pending the review of the impact on those that are already working. “Our people deserve clean water from their taps,” he said.
