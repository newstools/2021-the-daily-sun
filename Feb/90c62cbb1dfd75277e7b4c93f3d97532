THE Phalane family need help from SunReaders. They’ve been living in a house in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, which has had no roof for five months. Speaking to Daily Sun, Bontle (25) said she cries whenever it rains. They’re forced to step over water puddles. She said six kids and four adults live in the house. “I live with my pensioner grandparents, mother, child and siblings,” said Bontle. She said the roof collapsed last September during heavy rains, and fixing it is a problem as only one of them is employed. “Community members and my grandfather’s friend have tried to help,” she said. A Good Samaritan bought them toiletries last week. “The little help we’ve been getting means a lot and makes a huge difference. “We’re still battling with essentials, especially food, because we often run out and go hungry.” She said others donated money to fix the roof. “Any help from SunReaders would be appreciated. The house isn’t in a good state.”
