REALITY TV star and businesswoman Mome Mahlangu has gone down memory lane. The media personality has revealed that her priorities have changed and she’s not the same person she was before. In a brief post, Mome shared an image of herself holding a bunch of sneakers and said she has grown from who she was 15 years ago.

Mome was once part of Vuzu docu-reality show Cream Cartel that created a cultural reset. It was about the lives of four uber-cool Joburg creatives and their creative processes.
