MZANSI’S sexiest podcast is back again this week with another steamy episode. Hosts Mlungisi Mpela and Gomie Seabi, as well as an expert, will be discussing the importance of foreplay during sex. Speaking to SunBuzz, Mlungisi said: “I’m really excited for this week’s episode as we will be heating things up. “We will be discussing all things foreplay and unpacking the role it plays during sex.” The talented presenter said he believed that foreplay was important during sex. “During one of our off-air discussions with my co-host Gomie, she beautifully said that you cannot fry an egg without heating the pan with oil. I totally agree. “This is because there are processes that people have to go through in order to have the perfect sex,” said Mlungisi. “Things like how you kiss and touch each other are very important because they can activate the greatest arousal that can lead to the greatest orgasm. “Most people tend to ignore foreplay and go straight to penetration, which then leads to boring sex. It’s also important to listen to your partner.” Mlungisi said foreplay was more important to women than to men. “Although sex is about serving each other’s needs, I believe that is important to women than it is to men because it gets them heated and ready for action. “I’m singling out women because according to statistics, over 30% of women across the globe tend to orgasm to foreplay than actual penetration.” Mlungisi also said people should not be worried when their partner enjoyed foreplay more than the actual sex. “Women want different things when it comes to sex. Some days they want oral while others they want fingering or penetrative. So it shouldn’t be an issue. “In fact, that should display the skill of the other person if you can get a woman to orgasm with physical sex,” he said.
