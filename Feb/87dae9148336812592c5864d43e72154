A 45-year-old mine official in Barberton has been arrested for alleged tender corruption and extortion. The arrest was made by members of the Mpumalanga Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation team during an intelligence-driven operation on Friday. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, the arrest followed reports of the official allegedly demanding a substantial amount of money from a businessman who had an existing tender with the mine. The official had allegedly been demanding the money every month since 2018. “The case was brought to the Hawks’ attention in December 2020. It then culminated in an intensive investigation that resulted in the arrest,” said Sekgotodi. “The official was found with just over R150 000 in cash during his arrest. The money has been seized and will form part of the evidence during trial. The suspect is expected to appear in the Nelspruit Magistrates Court on Monday. Additional charges of money laundering, enticement to commit crime as well as conspiracy to commit crime are being explored,” she added.
