KAIZER Chiefs captain Ramahlwe Mphahlele has urged his teammates to “knuckle down and work harder” to ensure they turn the corner because no one is coming to save them. The Glamour Boys have fallen back to early-season struggles again and are currently enduring another tough winless period. have lost the last three matches in a row in all competitions.They continue to fall away from the business end of the DStv Premiership table. But Rama, who was recently confirmed by coach Gavin Hunt as Amakhosi’s new captain, insists they can turn things around. “Losing three games in a row is not nice at all, there is no other way to put it,” said Mphahlele. “For a team of our calibre, with the quality we have, it’s not good enough. We have to stick together as players and just keep on fighting. “The only people who are going to take Kaizer Chiefs out of this situation are this current crop of players, there’s no one who is going to come from anywhere to save us. “We have to knuckle down and work harder to turn the corner, I believe it’s possible. We have to put a little bit more greed, determination and just fight. With a positive attitude, we can turn the corner.” It does not get any easier for Chiefs as far as opponents are concerned. They next face title-challenging SuperSport United at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3 pm). “They are a team that always gives us problems, they are very difficult to play against because they have such good players,” added Mphahlele. “But we have to be strong together as a group and believe that we can start collecting points. That’s what we are lacking at the moment, we don’t believe we can win. But it’s another opportunity to fix our mistakes, we have to get maximum points.”
