THE Samas have reached a new milestone. The popular music awards hit an all-time record since inception in 1994. According to organisers, the Samas have received a total number of 1 163 entries. Entries for this year’s Samas opened last November and closed at midnight, 31 January. The call was that the Samas were inclusive and fair, and that music was judged on its merits by reputable industry experts. Musicians from all genres, persuasions and influences threw their names in the proverbial hat to be considered for the much sought-after trophy. Speaking to Daily Sun, Recording Industry of South Africa CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi said he was impressed by the positive response from the industry. “We’re greatly encouraged by this huge number of entries despite the challenges we faced as a nation, from the Covid-19 pandemic to economic woes and loss of income, especially in the creative sector,” he said.

Congratulations to the team at the Samas, and best wishes to all musicians who brought their names forward.” The next step was the vetting of entries that will be conducted by a special independent committee of industry practitioners. “That would then be followed by a judging process by independent panellists as selected by the industry committees. The list of nominated artists will be announced in April,” he said.
