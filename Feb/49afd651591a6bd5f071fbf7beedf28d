THEY were told their daughter had a calling and should thwasa. Nine-year-old Refiloe Releie went to initiation school in March, but now she can’t go home. This is because the family needs to slaughter a sheep and goat to welcome her home and pay the gobela R4 000, but they can’t afford it. They’re now asking for help to bring their little girl home. Refilwe’s aunt, Puleng Solo (49) from Kutlwanong in the Free State, told Daily Sun no one in the family works. “We’ve been asking the gobela for more time while we ask for donations and she agreed,” she said. “But she’s losing patience. We want Refiloe to go back to her normal life. She said they allowed Refiloe to go to initiation school as she had been sick for two years. “She’d faint at school and had no idea what happened when she woke up. She used to see snakes and spirits in the house, but we didn’t see them.” Puleng said traditional healers told them Refiloe had a calling and would be healed if she answered the calling. “It was either she thwasa or we lose her. It was really bad,” she said. ALSO READ: PROSECUTOR BUST FOR SHOPLIFTING! Puleng described Refiloe as a smart kid who always has a bright smile. “She’s a very respectful child. You’ll never find her being unruly no matter how angry she is. She’s a great kid to raise,” she said. Gobela Lebohang Ntsane said Refiloe needed to go back home. “We can’t keep her here any longer. She’s done with everything. She needs to go back and continue with school. I’ll give the family a few more days,” said Lebohang.
