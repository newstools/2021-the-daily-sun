A warrant of arrest has been issued for AbaThembu king
Buyelekaya Dalindyebo after he failed to appear in the Mthatha Magistrate's
Court on Thursday. The warrant of arrest had been stayed until his next court
appearance, said National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson Luxolo
Tyali. "The court was informed that he is ill. A warrant of
arrest was then issued but it was stayed until he brings a medical
certificate." Tyali said the case was postponed to 10 March. In March last year, City Press reported Dalindyebo allegedly
went on a rampage in the Bumbane Great Place. The wife of his son, former acting king Azenathi, was
hospitalised, while Azenathi was also seen limping later, the publication
reported. Dalindyebo allegedly stormed the Great Place and threw out
clothes belonging to Azenathi and breaking furniture. He was allegedly carrying an axe. SOURCE: NEWS24
