THE man accused of killing Tshegofatso Pule has been sentenced to 30 years in jail. This after he pleaded guilty to all charges against him and agreed to turn state witness. Muzikayise Malephane (31), who was facing charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice, appeared in the Johannesburg High Court on Friday. Presiding Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng sentenced him to 20 years for murder, five for defeating the ends of justice and another five for possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition. The accused had entered into a plea and sentence agreement with the state. Malephane’s lawyers told the court that their client was hired to kill Pule by her boyfriend, who did not want his wife to find out that he had impregnated her. Pule (28) was eight months pregnant when she was killed last June. Her body was found hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort, by passersby. Her death sparked an outcry against gender-based violence in the country and a call for justice for all the women who had lost their lives in similar incidents. Lebo Moemisi from Our Sister’s Keeper Movement told Daily Sun they were happy that justice had prevailed, but not with the sentence. “I know Tshego on a personal level, and I feel that the accused should have received a life sentence because he killed two people. For now, I will find comfort in the fact that he confessed to his wrongdoings and will remain in prison for his evil deeds. Tshego fought for herself and the truth was revealed, even though it was gruesome,” said Moemisi.
