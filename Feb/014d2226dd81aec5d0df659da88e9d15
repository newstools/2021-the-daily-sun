SAMIR Nurkovic is available for Kaizer Chiefs Tuesday’s Caf Champions League Group C clash against Horoya. Amakhosi will be playing in the group stages for the first time in 24 years. They will kick-off their African safari when they host the Guinean giants at FNB Stadium (6pm). Nurkovic was forced off the pitch when he picked up an injury in their DStv Premiership 1-1 draw against SuperSport United on Saturday. Willard Katsande is also available for selection after recovering from a shoulder knock. The bad news is that Amakhosi will be without the likes of Khama Billiat, Kgotso Moleko, Happy Mashiane, Dumisani Zuma and Erick Mathoho who are still nursing an assortment of injuries. This will be Chiefs first Group stage match. They will jet off to Burkina Faso to face Wydad Casablanca in another Champions League tie on Sunday. Amakhosi’s maiden group stage voyage was put on ice after their scheduled fixture against Wydad Casablanca was postponed. Gavin Hunt’s charges were denied visas to Morocco due to Covid-19 concerns. As a result, Chiefs will face Wydad in a neutral venue.
