AFTER she was axed by two radio stations, Zookey Zarling refused to give up on her career. Real name Zukiswa Vutela, Zookey said radio gave her life. She is currently hosting The Rise FM Drive with Zookey and Lilly on the Mpumalanga station. “I love radio and it lives within me. I believe that working as a radio host is like roaming in green pastures. I have a talent; a gift from above,” said Zookey, who joined Rise FM in December. Zookey was fired by Gagasi FM in 2015 after much publicised drama following her claims that she was impregnated by Generations: The Legacy actor Kay Sibiya. She then joined Vuma FM the following year, but was eventually shown the door after she split coffee in studio, which was against the station’s rules. ALSO READ: PRESENTER STABBED, HUSBAND SOUGHT! After all the negativity, Zookey said she would never give up on radio. “The best thing I love about radio is that listeners get to imagine the presenter; they get to imagine how you express yourself when you talk on the mic. Listeners learn to use their imagination. That is why they say radio is the theatre of mind,” said Zookey. The bubbly radio personality said she can work for any radio station. “For me, there’s no big or small radio station – as long as long as it gives a listener what they need. I can work for a community radio, which will not mean that I’m down and out or have downgraded because I respect all radio stations,” she added.
