MAMELODI Sundowns are making a habit of making things tough for themselves this season. For a team that dominates games, Masandawana shouldn’t have problems brushing aside lowly sides such Stellenbosch, no matter the competition. But they made heavy weather of their Nedbank Cup opener, seen as they raised sweat to see off Stellies 3-2 in their last 32 round fixture at Loftus Versfeld last night. Stellies were first on the scoresheet, getting in the lead through Ashley du Preez’s opener early in the 12th minute. But Sundowns were back in it four minutes later, Peter Shalulile levelling for the home side before the Winelands boys frustrated their illustrious opponents for the better parts of the match. Just as Gaston Sirino thought he had sealed Downs a last-16 round spot with a late winner, Phathutshedzo Nange made it 2-2 to take the game into extra time. However, Shalulile grabbed a late winner and his second of the match. But in truth, there was no need for the late drama, on the evidence of how Manqoba Mngqithi’s side dominated proceedings. Nothing suggested they were undermining their opponents as he fielded a strong team. Sundowns made two changes to the team that thumped Chippa United, Denis Onyango getting a rest as Ricardo Goss made his debut in goals and Rivaldo Coetzee starting in midfield. But as Mngqithi said afterwards, his team is “not sharp in front of goal”. Their struggles upfront were once again laid bare through a plethora of opportunities they messed up.  But Stellies walked away with their heads held high. They really gave it their best shot.
