Sassa Western and Eastern Cape regional manager, Bandile Maqetuka, has been suspended following sexual harassment allegations. It’s alleged the incident involves Maqetuka and a Sassa employee based in the East London office. Sassa CEO Totsie Memela placed Maqetuka on precautionary suspension. “We’re committed to ensuring all employees feel safe and are treated equally,” said Memela. “To this end, the agency has embarked on an internal awareness campaign to educate employees about sexual harassment and what their rights are.” Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said a letter was sent to Maqetuka and the victim notifying them of the investigation. “Maqetuka’s precautionary suspension will ensure there’s no hindrance in the investigation, and a full report will be submitted to Memela once the investigation is complete,” said Letsatsi. DA MPL Gillion Bosman, who’s the party’s spokesman on social development, said: “We will not accept any attempt by Sassa to use Maqetuka’s suspension to delay processes and transparency in dealing with the current crisis. “With over 48 000 temporary disability grants still to be processed in the Western Cape, the president and Minister Lindiwe Zulu must see to it that Sassa has enough capacity, even without the regional manager, to deliver on promises given to the standing committee as well as the residents who rely on disability grants in the province.” Maqetuka was at the forefront of the fight to bring Sassa offices back to order after an outcry over long queues in Cape Town. Minister Zulu was also in the province recently, where she visited Sassa offices.
