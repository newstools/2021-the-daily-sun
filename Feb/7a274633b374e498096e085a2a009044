MAMELODI Sundowns got their Caf Champions League group stage campaign off to a bright start as they thumped Al Hilal 2-0 at Loftus on Saturday. An early goal from Mosa Lebusa and a late strike from Kermit Erasmus sealed a convincing win for the 2016 Champions League winners, ensuring they continue their fine domestic run. Victory, achieved through blood and sweat, also ensured the Brazilians preserve their 19-game unbeaten record at home in the Caf tournament. Lebusa headed in powerfully past goalkeeper Mohammed Saeed after a perfectly delivered pass from Lakay. Erasmus skinned a defender and calmly slotted past the goalie to make it two after a great hold up play as the Sudanese side left their defence exposed. Lyle Lakay drew a stunpedous save from the Hilal 'keeper with a stinging free-kick. As the pendulum swung fully the Downs way, Rivaldo Coetzee got to the end of the rebound before his cross was cleared away by the defence.
