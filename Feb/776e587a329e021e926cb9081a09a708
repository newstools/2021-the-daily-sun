DUMISANI Mkhwanazi has been sentenced to 43 years in prison. This following the five charges he was found guilty of last December. Mkhwanazi was given 20 years for the murder of UJ student Palesa Madiba, 10 for possession of unlicensed firearm, eight for defeating the ends of justice, three for cellphone theft and two for illegal possession of ammunition. Judge Prince Manyathi ordered the murder, possession of illegal firearm and ammunition sentences to go concurrently, meaning that Mkhwanazi will effectively serve 31 years in prison. The sentence was well-received by the family, who left the court in a jubilant mood. Mkhwanazi maintained his innocence throughout the trial, denying everything linking him to the crimes and also opposing what most witnesses said against him. Manyathi said Mkhwanazi didnâ€™t show remorse for his actions.
