WHILE many older musicians are on the brink of retiring, Mduduzi Magwaza released a debut album at the age of 71! The legendary jazz musician from KwaMashu in Durban, KZN, said it’s better to do something later than not do it at all. His 11-track album, titled Siyabonga Njinji, praises his ancestors for keeping him alive all these years. He told Daily Sun age is just a number and he still feels strong. “I’ve lost many people in my musical journey, which started in the 80s. Others are unable to sing or perform because of their ages or illnesses,” he said. “I still feel strong and fresh and want to praise my ancestors and God for protecting me and leading me all the way.” Madala Mduduzi said it was his wish to release a solo album, but he spent more time touring the world with many jazz bands as he was a session musician. “I was among the people who formed Bayete in the early 80s,” he said. “I was a member of Mango Grove from 1986 and toured the world playing the penny whistle and alto saxophone.” He moved back to Durban when Mango Grove disbanded in 2010 and worked with the legendary Madala Kunene. In 2012 he joined jazz band Umkhumbane Jazz Ensemble, and this was when he realised his dream to release a solo album could still come true. Siyabonga Njinji is available on all digital platforms.
