“THE interests of justice do not permit your release on bail.” These were the words of Magistrate Michelle Pillay to bribery-accused prosecutor Dumisa Kumbaca during the judgement on his bail application at the East London Magistrates Court on Friday. Kumbaca was kept in custody pending the finalisation of his case of corruption and defeating the ends of justice. The state intended that Kumbaca extorted R25 000 from a drunk driving accused he had prosecuted, and destroyed two dockets the police were investigating against the accused. The National Prosecuting Authority has since suspended Kumbaca with pay. Pillay said there was strong evidence that Kumbaca would interfere with the evidence and intimidate witnesses as he had done in the past, according to the investigating officer. “The investigating officer alleges that the witness was contacted by the applicant. The witness was further contacted by an unknown person telling him the Hawks would pick him up,” she said. Pillay added that Kumbaca’s case going to trial did not depend on the arrest of another suspect, who was also a prosecutor and colleague of Kumbaca at the same court. She said the fact that Kumbaca knew the identity of the witness and had threatened them twice detriments against his release. “The applicant is very resourceful. From the evidence before this court, the applicant did not cooperate with the police; he evaded them at all cost. The applicant was only arrested the following day with the assistance of the police intelligence unit,” said Pillay. “The docket, said to be in his possession and money said to have been given by the witness, were still missing,” said Pillay. The case was postponed to 19 March for further investigation.
