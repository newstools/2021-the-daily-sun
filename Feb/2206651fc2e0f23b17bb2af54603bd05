WHEN Daisy Makola (30) was allegedly stabbed to death by her ex-boyfriend on Monday evening and fled the scene, a manhunt was launched. On Friday morning, 12 February, Limpopo police made a breakthrough and arrested the 37-year-old man. Daisy, who had three children, was found lying dead in a pool of blood at a house in Extension 44 outside Polokwane following the alleged argument between her and the suspect. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the suspect was arrested by a team of dedicated detectives from the provincial office, Thohoyandou Crime Intelligence Unit and Siloam Detectives. “He was at his hideout at Tshikombani outside Thohoyandou. He was officially charged with a case of murder, and further expected to appear before the Polokwane Magistrates Court on Monday,” Ngoepe said. Ngoepe added that the motive behind the killing was still unknown. MEC for Social Development Nkakareng Rakgoale said she was worried about the re-emergence of gender-based violence and femicide incidents in Limpopo. “It is very disturbing to hear that the attacks on women and children are continuing in the province, especially during the Coronavirus pandemic. The criminals who kill women and children must be brought to book,” Rakgoale said. “Teams of psychosocial support have been dispatched to the Makola family to provide necessary support. We also have a family preservation programme that can assist to build strong family units, and our people are implored to make use of them to avert some of these tragedies that leave children orphaned,” Rakgoale added.
