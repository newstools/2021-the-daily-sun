SAFETY boots disappeared at his workplace and his boss suspected he stole them. Phillip Mtshwene was then allegedly kidnapped and beaten for a confession, but he died a few hours later. The boots were then found and his boss (57) and two other people, both aged 17, were arrested for his murder last Thursday. Now Phillip’s devastated mum Phindile Makhubo (54) from Zamane in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, wants justice for her 29-year-old son who worked as a livestock herder. “My son was clearly killed for nothing. Why didn’t they call the police if they suspected he stole the boots?” she asked. She said the boss allegedly told her eldest daughter he’d pay for his freedom as he has money. “He will be able to buy his freedom, but what about me? He must pay for his sins,” she said.  Phindile said after the man was arrested, he asked to see her. “He begged to bury my son, but I refused. Maybe he wanted to buy his freedom. I don’t want his money,” she said. “They killed my son like a dog. I heard they used a pick handle, knobkerrie and steel rod to beat him for mere safety boots.” She said the suspects allegedly dumped her son at her gate after assaulting him. “His friend and I took him to his room to sleep. At the time, I only saw bruises on his face and thought he would be okay. After he died, police came and a cop photographer removed his clothes. “That’s when I noticed open wounds on his body. I would have called an ambulance had I known and saw the wounds,” said Phindile. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu said: “The victim was allegedly taken from his home by the employer’s son and his friends to an unknown place where they assaulted him.” She said the victim was later brought home. “The unlawful action by the suspects comes from the accusations of theft of property against the victim by his employer.” She said the suspects have already appeared in court and will appear again soon.
