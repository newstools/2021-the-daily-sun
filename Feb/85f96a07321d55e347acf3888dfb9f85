FORMER AmaZulu boss Lunga Sokhela spend most of his time in the kitchen instead of being on the pitch now that he is no longer involved in football. He has posted pictures while cooking Chicken and veggies trying to outsmart Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni who has gained more popularity by posting meal that he cooks on Twitter like tin fish mixed with onion, tomatoes, and potatoes. It seems Mboweni has inspired a lot of men including Sokhela who asked him what he thinks about his meal.
