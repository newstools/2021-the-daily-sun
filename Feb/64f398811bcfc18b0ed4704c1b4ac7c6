Can sex be an emotionless activity? Some might argue that the perfect sex has no emotional attachment to it. But according to many experts, sex in some way is an act that involves feelings. This can be said about demisexual beings. Demisexual are people who only feel sexually attracted to someone when they have an emotional bond with them. Despite their sexual orientation, the prefix “demi” means half, which can refer to being halfway between sexual and asexual. According to experts, demisexuality can be a type of graysexuality. A graysexual person may experience sexual attraction only rarely or feel sexual attraction but aren’t that interested in sex. Demisexual people do not feel primary attraction - the one you feel for someone when you first meet them. They only feel secondary attraction - the type that happens after knowing someone for a while.
