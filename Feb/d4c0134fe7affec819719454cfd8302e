FOOTBALL fans were left unimpressed by midfielder Willard Katsande after their 1-1 draw against SuperSport United in a DStv Premiership on Saturday. Katsande started the game and lasted 64 minutes on the field as he was substituted following a shoulder injury. In his rare start this season, undoubtedly, Katsande had a solid shift until he got injured and was substituted. While he was sitting on the stands, the 35-year-old seem to have no interest on the match as he was spotted by the camera sitting on his phone for the remainder of the match. This was Chiefs sixth consecutive match without a win in all competitions. Katsande already checking his bettings on betway. #DStvPrem #Amakhosi4Life pic.twitter.com/5tQXGEmllZ  That's unprofessional from a legend like katsande, what message is he sending to the young and upcoming players.i am verry dissapointed That's unprofessional from a legend like katsande, what message is he sending to the young and upcoming players.i am verry dissapointed  Not @WillardKatsande on his cellphone after being substituted ??‍????‍??during a match ???? #DStvPrem @KaizerChiefs  Willard Katsande is uploading his dancing video on Instagram and not watching the match????
