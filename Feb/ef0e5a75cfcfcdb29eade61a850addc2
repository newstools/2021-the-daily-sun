GOLDEN Arrow Bus Services passengers in Cape Town are still shocked after getting robbed by criminals who posed as passengers. One passenger, who asked to remain anonymous, said the bus was travelling from Mitchells Plain to Tyger Valley. “They planned the robbery well because they waited for the bus to be in motion. Then while everyone had their phones out to listen to music, they started collecting them,” said the passenger. Golden Arrow spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said unknown perpetrators, posing as passengers, held up the passengers and driver. “We condemn this act of criminality in the strongest possible terms, and call on the SAPS and government to help us,” Dyke-Beyer said. Anyone with information regarding the incident can contact 0800 111 167. Zukile Mzava said Golden Arrow needed private security inside its buses. “Robbers roam these buses almost every month. The best way is to hire private security because passengers who lost their belongings received no compensation.” He added that criminals would only stop robbing passengers as soon as the buses had security. “This is the least Golden Arrow can do for its loyal passengers as it cannot let this happen any longer.” Another resident said the criminals didn’t just rob the bus, they also made sure that everyone had their cellphones out first. Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the robbery, saying the passengers were robbed by four suspects on the R300 close to Mitchells Plain. “No one sustained any injury and the case was reported at Bellville Police Station, where it was currently under investigation.”
