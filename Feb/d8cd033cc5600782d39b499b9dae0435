WHAT was supposed to be a day of relief for Calvin Mampa turned into another disappointment on Wednesday, 3 February. Naing Soe, CEO of Mamelodi Day Hospital in Tshwane, allegedly fled instead of attending to Calvin. The 39-year-old Calvin from Ekangala has been living in pain since the hospital botched an operation four years ago. He reached out to Daily Sun for help last month. He said he went to the hospital with a stomach bug but left with a deep wound. After the story was published, the Gauteng health department arranged a meeting with Soe, but he was a no-show and instead sent executive clinical manager Tebatso Tebeila. Calvin said although the hospital had promised to give him medical attention, it was hard to believe its promises would be kept. “I’ve communicated with the hospital before and nothing happened,” he told the People’s Paper. “I’m not convinced they’ll come through, but I’m happy there has been progress.” Calvin attended the meeting with his mum Olga, a legal advisor and community leader. Olga (65) was disappointed the doctor who left her son in pain didn’t attend the meeting. “My child has been in pain for four years. I don’t want any delays. I just want him to be healed,” she said. Calvin’s lawyer, Raymond Rasebitse, wanted to make sure the hospital fixed the mess. He said the meeting was a chance for the CEO to explain how the hospital planned to help Calvin. He wasn’t satisfied with the meeting as the people responsible for causing pain and suffering weren’t there. When the SunTeam contacted Soe, he said he didn’t run away but that Calvin arrived an hour late. The CEO said he’d arranged for Calvin to see a specialistat Steve Biko Academic Hospital.
