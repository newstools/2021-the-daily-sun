Masks are now part of our daily routine, that one item you can’t leave the house without. But how clean is your mask? Do you wash it every day or repeat one for at least two days because you don’t have the time? A mask has to be treated like underwear. You’d not wear the same underwear twice, so why not do the same with your mask? It prevents the virus from spreading and protects you from germs that harbour around it. All it takes is a quick wash with soap and water. Nothing out of normal routine.
