HE lost everything when he started smoking zol and nyaope nine years ago. Even his best friends distanced themselves from him as he didn’t have any direction in life. But Vusumuzi Mkhwanazi saw the light and quit smoking nyaope lat month. The 32-year-old from Amanda Park in Tshwane told Daily Sun that he was introduced to nyaope by a friend. He said life became horrible and difficult. “I had an appointment with the devil when I smoked nyaope,” he said. He said that he struggled to get money to feed his habit as there wasn’t much recycling during lockdown. “You have to sweat and work hard to get nyaope. I used to do anything to get money to feed my habit. Nyaope is not bought on sekoloto (credit) – it’s cash and carry,” he said. Vusumuzi said he usually had stomach cramps when he didn’t smoke nyaope and zol. “Nyaope wasted my time and money. I spent over R200 everyday. It ruined my life, but I don’t blame anyone. It’s not easy to quit, but I was brave,” he added. Vusumuzi was currently looking for a job to start his life. “I am clean and want to be a good example to addicts,” he said. Vhathu Phanda Community Forum chairman Thabo Moshebelo said he was happy Vusumuzi chose a good road. He said they would continue to support him. “He is on the right path and is always in his shack. We are proud of him,” he said.
