SPRINGBOK captain Siya Kolisi is leaving the Stormers and is expected to be unveiled at the Sharks. The loose forward will be bringing to an end his 11-year stay at the Cape Town franchise, who released him early from his contract early, which was due to expire at the end of October, having accepted a transfer fee from an unnamed team. But speculation is rife that he is headed for Durban. Kolisi has already bid farewell to Western Province. “I would like to thank everyone at Western Province Rugby for what has been an incredible time in my life in which I have grown as a rugby player and a person,” he said. “All of the coaches, management and teammates who had such a big influence on me over the last 11 years and especially the Stormers faithful and people of Cape Town and beyond who made my time with the union so special. It has been a privilege to experience their support.” Kolisi is the second-most capped Stormers’ player in Super Rugby with 118 appearances, behind legend Schalk Burger (123). The 29-year-old led the Boks to their 2019 Rugby World Cup triumph.
