KAIZER Chiefs are on a mission to stun Wydad Athletic! The two sides will meet at the 4 August Stadium in
Ouagadougou on Sunday at 6 pm SA time. Chiefs are going to this game having failed to win their
first group match at home on Tuesday. They were held to a goalless draw by Guinean champions
Horoya. Having failed to get maximum points at home, they are under
immense pressure heading to their second match against Moroccan giants away. Chiefs midfielder Anthony Akumu is aware that their
opponents are the favourites heading to this encounter. But he reckons that
it's a good sign they are the underdogs. “Wydad Athletic are a good side, they have competed for many
years," said Akumu. “On our side, maybe we will look like underdogs but that's a
good sign because maybe they don't know us. So, that's another good thing. Akumu said they will try their best to milk maximum points
from the 2017 Champions. “For us, we will just go there, play our game the way we
know and do our best to get maximum points. It’s very important to get the
three points. We have ambitions to get out of the group stages of the Champions
League,” he added. “I think the spirit is there and everyone is eager because
we didn't get maximum points in the last game."
