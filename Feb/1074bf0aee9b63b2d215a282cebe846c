BONGANI Zungu has been dropped
from the Europa League squad! RANGERS coach Steven Gerrard has
confirmed that the Bafana Bafana midfielder is one of the players who breached
coronavirus rules and has been removed from the team travelling to Belgium on
Thursday. Five players, including
Zungu, Nathan Patterson, Calvin Bassey, Dapo Mebude, and goalkeeper Brian
Kinnear have withdrawn from the team that will face Royal Antwerp in the first
leg of the Europa League last-32 duel. This comes after the players
breached Covid-19 protocols. Gerrard has said he feels
"personally let down" by the Covid rule breakers, who attended a
party just days before the team’s last 32 tie. "First and foremost, we
have to acknowledge that five of our players have been involved in a breach of
Covid regulations which from the top of the club to the bottom we are all
really disappointed in. That will be dealt with internally.” Gerrard told
Rangers TV. Scotland remains under tight
restrictions to help curb the spread of Covid-19, with no indoor mixing of
households allowed under normal circumstances. Rangers' most recent breach
comes two months after Jordan Jones and George Edmundson were handed two-week
club suspensions for breaching coronavirus protocols by attending an illegal
house party. Northern Ireland winger Jones
and defender Edmundson were subsequently handed seven-match bans by the
Scottish Football Association and left the club in January. Gerrard added: "The
players will be fined, and we are in dialogue with the SFA and the government
to find a solution moving forward in terms of them boys. "They have been removed
from the club and the squad for now on a short-time basis while they isolate. I
will sit down with them face to face when we can do so."
