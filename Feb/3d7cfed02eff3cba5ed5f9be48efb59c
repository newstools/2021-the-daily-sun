MARITZBURG United coach Ernst Middendorp was left furious after his side lost 2-1 to Golden Arrows in a DStv Premiership Kwa-Zulu Natal derby clash at Sugar Ray Stadium on Saturday. Middendorp said his players must learn to manage the games after they have taken the lead because if they don’t, they will find themselves in trouble. The visitors took the lead via Thabiso Kutumela in the first half, in what was a dominant display from Maritzburg. However, in the second half, the Team of Choice dropped off and Arrows stormed back to take the game away from the struggling visitors to take the three points. “When things happen like this, you sometimes ask yourself what’s going on,” said a baffled Middendorp. “We must learn to manage the games, handle the games for longer periods, not only for 70 minutes of the game. That is what we have to do.” This loss to Arrows was the third on the bounce for Maritzburg after losing previously to TS Galaxy (3-0) and Orlando Pirates (1-0). They still remain third from bottom of the table with nine points from 14 games, alongside 15th placed Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and bottom side Black Leopards, who both also have nine points). While Maritzburg are losing games, they should be grateful that Leopards and TTM are not winning games either. Leopards lost to Galaxy and TTM lost to Bloemfontein Celtic, also on Saturday. TTM have lost their five league matches while Leopards have lost their last three just like Maritzburg. “It was an excellent first half and totally dominant but in the end, we were not able to win the game,” added Middendorp. “It is our problem at the moment, but we have to work on it. Even though the majority of the game was good, we have to convert chances to win the games.” Maritzburg will put their league campaign on hold this week. They host GladAfrica Championship side Sekhukhune United in the Nedbank Cup Last-32 at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday (5pm).
