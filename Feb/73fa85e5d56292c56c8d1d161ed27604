THINGS are about to heat up in the Senzo Meyiwa case. According to Advocate Malesela Teffo, the family is seeking help from the Hawks. The Meyiwas hired Teffo to help them solve the case. Teffo said he sent the request to the Hawks to speed up investigations. He told Daily Sun the family’s decision was sparked by the five bust suspects, who they strongly believe had nothing to do with Senzo’s murder. “The family is not at all happy that the case was removed from being a priority case to a cold case with the SAPS leadership claiming there’s been no breakthrough in the matter,” said Teffo. He claimed there were clear leads which could bring justice to the Meyiwa family, but there was foul play. “The real culprits are still out there, but the lead investigator, who claimed he had a confession and suspects, just made matters worse,” he said. Teffo said he sent letters to the Hawks, SAPS and NPA in an attempt to close the gaps that were deliberately left open. He said that he’s been observing the prosecution, who seem to be conflicted when it came to this matter. “I’ve requested the services of a prosecutor who’s been handling political killings in KZN to step in. I trust him because culprits have been brought to law since he moved that side,” he said. Prosecutor George Baloyi responded to Adv Teffo. Baloyi said: “The prosecution has agreed to meet with the family as they are victims of a crime and have lost a loved one.” Baloyi added he will also request Adv Gerie Nel of AfriForum to be present as he has been acting for the family.
