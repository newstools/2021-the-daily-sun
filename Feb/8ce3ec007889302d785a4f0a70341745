PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa lifted the ban on the sale of alcohol on Monday. And first to celebrate were Gabola Church members. The church, which holds services in taverns while members drink, will finally be able to operate again. Church founder Pope Tsietsi Makiti told Daily Sun it was the best news since the start of the year. He said members couldn’t enjoy the festive season as alcohol was banned. “There was no church and no alcohol. We felt like an abandoned nation.” Members would be able to pray hard with the ban lifted. He said they got their strength to pray from alcohol. “The more alcohol we have, the more we pray and the more we curse bad spirits,” he said. Makiti said the plan was to get as much alcohol as possible so the church could worship on Sunday. “When we pray this time we’ll be cursing the demon of Covid-19. We want it to leave us for good,” he said. “With the amount of alcohol we’ll have, we’ll be able to pray very long and hard. “Our prayers will definitely be heard and the world will be saved from this virus through us.” Church member Simon Khuzwayo (44) said: “I nearly died. I was thirsty and I missed church so much.” He said he quit praying because when he was sober he mumbled. “I didn’t even know what I was saying when I was sober. When I’m drunk I pray and speak in tongues,” a tipsy-looking Simon told Daily Sun. Thulisise Ngubane (40) said: “Amen, now you can pass on the booze.” Katlego Kau (39) said: “This coming Sunday we will be at church.”
