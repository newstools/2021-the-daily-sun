BLACK Leopards have appointed former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates coach Kosta Papic as their new “technical manager”. The 60-year-old Serbian will essentially be the new head coach of Lidoda Duvha as he will be responsible for the team’s performance, take training sessions and sit on the bench on match day. He joins the Limpopo side after he parted ways with Ghanaian side Hearts of Oak barely three months into his second spell at the club. He now begins his second spell at Lidoda Duvha, having previously been the coach seven years ago. Papic will be working closely with Lehlohonolo Seema and Mongezi Bobe, who will be assisting him. The well-travelled coach has led a number of teams in Mzansi including the two Soweto giants Chiefs and Pirates, Leopards, Maritzburg United, Polokwane City and Chippa United. His last stint in the country was with troubled Royal Eagles. Papic has vowed to help Leopards move away from the bottom of the DStv Premiership table. “We are Black Leopards. We can do it,” said Papic at his unveiling during a virtual press conference yesterday. “I came back because I wanted to operate in a professional club and environment. I am convinced we will succeed. We have a good technical team and the full support of the management. I would not have signed if I did not believe that it was possible to save the club from relegation.” Papic could be on the bench when Leopards take on Baroka in the Limpopo derby at Peter Mokaba Stadium tomorrow (5pm). Meanwhile, Seema has pledged his full support to Papic and said he is looking forward to working with him.
