ANTI-LOCKDOWN protestors say masks and lockdown restrictions are something they don’t believe in. On Friday, they picketed at Church Square in Tshwane without wearing masks or social distancing. Walter Mashilo said they were protesting against injustices happening in the country. He said the government was trying to take away their rights. “Our government is more offended by prayers than murders. As Christians, we are forced to believe in science. I would rather die than be vaccinated,” he said. Another protestor, Sibongile Mlangeni, said the government took away basic rights. “We’re not scared of the virus and we say no to lockdown,” she said. Shawn van der Merwe of the Vaccine Pushback Movement said they refused to wear masks during the protest as it showed they were not bowing to the system.  “We’re not here to do a stupid gathering. We’re sending a message to the government. We’re not afraid of contamination. “If it’s God’s will for us to die of Covid-19, surely we will,” she said. Mzi Ngewu from Kingdom Activists told Daily Sun the government should open churches. He said religious people’s rights were being taken away.  During the protest, two people were bust for not wearing masks. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed there was a gathering of church pastors at Church Square. “Two people have been arrested for contravening lockdown regulations for not wearing face masks in public,” he said. Masondo said the two paid a fine and were released.
