THE FATHER wanted meat badly and sent his son to the butcher to buy nyama on credit. But the son never gave the meat to his father – keeping it for himself instead – and the two started arguing. THE SON ALLEGEDLY WENT TO HIS SHACK, FETCHED A KNIFE, AND STABBED HIS DAD TO DEATH! A 27-year-old man was arrested on Saturday for the murder of a 54-year-old man at Orient Hills squatter camp in Magaliesburg, west of Joburg. “It’s alleged the suspect and the victim were at home when the argument ensued,” said Sergeant Kgomotso Mogwere. “The suspect left home and later came back home, pushed open the door and went to the victim’s bedroom, where he stabbed him several times in his sleep.” The suspect fled the scene. Mogwere said police on arrival found the victim lying on his back in the bedroom, with multiple stab wounds to his upper body. “A sharp object suspected to have been used in the commission of the crime was found next to the body and was confiscated,” he said. Paramedics were called to the crime scene and declared the victim dead. The incident left residents of Orient Hills in shock. “We’re shocked and saddened at the same time,” a neighbour told the People’s Paper. “The old man was with us during the day and now he’s gone. Dying is so easy.” Neighbours said the kindly old man used to get meat on credit from sellers because he was trustworthy. “We don’t know why the boy had to be greedy and didn’t want to share with his father,” said another neighbour. “His father was the one who was going to pay for the meat in the end.” The suspect was arrested on the same night. He appeared in the Krugersdorp Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 9 February. The case was postponed to 23 February.
