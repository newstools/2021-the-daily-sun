MPUMALANGA police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma has a warning for the youth who want to join the police service. He said they must be on the look-out for a man who calls himself Captain Bongane Hlope and offers fake police interviews. Zuma told Daily Sun Hlope operated around Hazyview, where he contacted people and asked if they wanted police jobs. Victims are then told to pay money to score points when they attend interviews at Hazyview Police Station. “It’s not true. There are no interviews for police trainees and people should know the trainee recruitment process was suspended due to Covid-19. “This man is going around asking people if they know anyone who previously applied and he requests their contact so he can phone to make arrangement,” he said. “We request the public to ignore this type of scam and report the matter to the police rather than be robbed of their hard-earned money.” Zuma said jobs weren’t for sale and residents should contact the police if anyone demanded money for such. “Know that you are being robbed and don’t send money to these type of people,” he told the People’s Paper. Anyone with information on this suspect can contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
