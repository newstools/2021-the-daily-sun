AFTER years of ups and downs, Lebogang Mosebetsi finally has a wheelchair for her son. This after she received help from founder of La Bone Day-care Centre, Thulani Mtshali. The 33-year-old from Ledig outside Rustenburg, North West, said she felt a huge weight had been lifted off her shoulders. “I’m very happy. I’ve been trying to get my son a wheelchair for years without success. Something has finally materialised. We no longer have to carry him around,” said Lebogang. She said they welcomed any help as her six-year-old son would be starting school soon. Her son suffers from cerebral palsy, a condition that affects body functions. He can only crawl, but does not have enough balance. Thulani said he was touched when he heard about Lebogang’s son. So he took it upon himself to donate a wheelchair. “The organisation deals with such issues. We believe every child deserves to be treated well. We fought hard to finally get this wheelchair, but it was all worth it. Everything was to make sure the little man is comfortable,” he said. The organisation, that started in 2019, already has 12 people living with disabilities on its database. Some are looking for help to find jobs, others for financial support for their education and others for wheelchair donations.
