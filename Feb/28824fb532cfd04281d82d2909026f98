Actor Pallance Dladla has scored a major role in Showmax’s thriller series, DAM. The talented actor will play the role of Themba, a young biker who’s on the run. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said he was overjoyed when he was told that he got the role. “I believe it came at the right time because there’s been a lot of uncertainty in the entertainment industry. “Even after we were cast my colleagues and I had to hold back the excitement because things were just unpredictable and anything could have happened, but I am glad we got through the storm,” he said.

He wants to find a home and sense of belonging, where he can be nurtured and loved,” he said. “But what he really needs to do is to stop running from himself, because it’s when he stops that he’ll find his true self. He needs to stop believing that the grass is greener on the other side.” Pallance said the challenges that came with the role brought out the best in him. “Themba deals with many internal battles, and such roles are difficult to play and come with a lot of challenges. “But that’s the thrill of being a performer. It allows me to dig deep inside to make sure the character is believable and resonates with people.” He enjoyed himself on set and shared that having a good working environment is important. “We were all in sync and had the same vision. I’m saying this because you can have a great script and production team, but if the people are not in sync if you meet certain challenges you won’t be able to pull through and produce something spectacular.” With many productions coming to an end, the former Isibaya actor said they’re adapting to the changes. “Although it’s challenging for everyone. I’m not scared of what’s going to happen next,” he said. The much-anticipated thriller will premiere on Showmax on 22 February.
