FEARLESS Cockroach Mdluli and Nolwazi Dlamini, snake catchers in the Bushbuckridge area, have become heroes for the Sihlangu family after they saved them from a giant black mamba that was occupying their garage. The family, from Dwarsloop outside Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, discovered the 2,5m-long black mamba on the roof on Thursday evening. Shocked grandson Makungu Sihlangu told Daily Sun that they were sitting outside the house near the open garage door when they spotted the giant snake on the roof, that then went into hiding. “We immediately contacted the municipality rescue team to come and search for it, but they stopped because it was dark. So they closed the exit point,” said Makungu. On Friday morning, Cockroach arrived and showed us the different types of snakes from a book, and my gogo showed him the one we saw, which was a mamba. “He went up the roof to search, and found it within five minutes. He then called Nolwazi to help him catch it,” he continued.  “We’re glad that they removed it because we couldn’t sleep on Thursday night, scared of the snake. Our garage has rats, and our chicken had been disappearing over the past month and we believe it was because of the snake.” Cockroach said the snake might have occupied the garage a long time ago to look for rats. “The family can count themselves lucky to have spotted it because this type of snake is dangerous. We removed it to the Kruger National Park. We warn residents to look out for the second one because this type of snake stays with a partner,” said Mdluli.
