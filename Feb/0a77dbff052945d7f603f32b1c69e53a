The  Democratic
Alliance (DA) wants Parliament to investigate Julius Malema’s visit to former
President Jacob Zuma’s home in Nkandla in KwaZulu Natal this week. The party’s Chief Whip in the National Assembly Natasha
Mazzone said they have written to Parliament asking them to investigate. “The
Speaker of the National Assembly has the authority to request the acting
secretary of Parliament to investigate all travel claims made by any member of
Parliament and also has the authority to report any possible abuse of resources
allocated to any current or former member of Parliament to the relevant
authority once she is made aware of such abuse,” said Mazzone. Mazonne said they want to know any “official travel
entitlements” for MPs was used to fund the visit. She also wants Parliament to
investigate if any vehicle protection services were used to transport Malema
and his crew to Langa. "As members of Parliament, we have an absolute
responsibility to ensure that at no time is the South African taxpayers’ money
abused or wasted. We have a duty to ensure that this tea party in no way, cost
the economy of South Africa a single cent, that could have been used to
purchase vaccines for the people,” said Mazzone. The EFF’s spokesman Vuayani Pambo said the DA is just trying
to poke the EFF only to start a conversation and his party will not be drawn
into it. “The EFF is a moving car and let those who are bucking continue to buck.
We don’t have time for that,” he said. Malema together with Pambo, Mzandile Masina, advocate Dali
Mpofu, and Tony Yengeni visited former President Jacob Zuma for a “cup of tea”.
The visit happened after Zuma publicly defied the Constitutional Court’s ruling
that required him to attend the Zondo Commission.
