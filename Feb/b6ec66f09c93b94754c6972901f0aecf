High-flying Golden Arrows have been brought back down to earth. This after they were downed 2-1 by struggling Black Leopards at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on yesterday. Mohammad Anas scored a stunning brace to end Abafana Bes’Thendende’s three match winning run in the DStv Premiership. This was the KwaZulu Natal outfit’s second defeat this season in the league and their third in all competitions. Mandla Ncikazi’s charges were forced to play with ten men in the latter stages of the match after birthday boy Pule Mmodi was given his marching orders by referee Luxolo Badi. In the end, Arrows were made to pay dearly as Leopards smelt blood and went for the kill. Arrows’ only joy came through their equalizer scored by Michael Gumede, a lovely backheel that went into the bottom corner. Leopards bagged their third win of the season and will now be hopeful of escaping the relegation zone. They had suffered five straight defeats in the league and were looking like favorites for the dreaded drop. Leopards next face AmaZulu in the Nedbank Cup last-16 at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday (3 pm). Meanwhile, Arrows will be looking to regain the form that saw them win the Q-2 and walk away with a cool R1.5-million. They face Baroka in their next league match next Wednesday at the same venue (5pm). “This is a wake-up call,” said Arrows coach Ncikazi. “We need to be ready for the next match.”
