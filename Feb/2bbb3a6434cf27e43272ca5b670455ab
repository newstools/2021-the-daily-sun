MARITZBURG United should be excited and not be afraid when they host Orlando Pirates in the Nedbank Cup last-16 at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday (6pm), says the club’s new recruit Ryan Rae. This is because Rae, who recently joined the club on a short-term deal until the end of the season after leaving Chippa United, knows what it takes to beat Pirates in a cup competition. His previous club, Highlands Park, knocked Pirates out in the first round of the MTN8 last season. The man who scored that day for Highlands was Wayde Jooste, who is now at Pirates. “Pirates are always a tough team (to play against), very good team, very good players,” said Rae. “But I don’t think we should be afraid. We should go there and compete because we have great players here at Maritzburg United. “There’s a lot of experience and a lot of youth which is awesome. “So I don’t think we should not be scared, but we should be excited and challenge them, and anything can happen.” Bucs have already defeated the Team of Choice in a DStv Premiership match this season at the same venue. Maritzburg go into this game having dropped to the bottom of the Premiership table after Black Leopards beat Golden Arrows 2-1 on Tuesday. The KZN side go to the game also having lost their last four league matches, scoring just once. However, Rae said playing in this cup could be a turning point for his new side. “Cups are different to the league and watching the team from the distance, the performances have not been bad,” added Rae. “Getting a good result in the cup could push us to show what we can be capable of.”
