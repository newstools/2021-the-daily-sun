HE broke into a gogo’s house to steal but ended up raping her. The 25-year-old suspect thought he would get off scot free but behind the scenes, cops were investigating. The suspect got the shock of his life when cops arrived at the nature reserve where he worked in Magagula Heights, near Katlehong in Ekurhuleni on Monday. The police’s Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate said through the help of the community and investigations by Sergeant Happy Kubheka and Sergeant Musa Maluleke, the suspect was tracked down. “The suspect forced entry into the house of a 75-year-old gogo at night by breaking the door, raped her and robbed her of an undisclosed amount of cash,” he said. Tshilate said the suspect fled to Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve where he had worked since September. Heidelberg station commander Colonel Phiwe Ndwandwe congratulated members for their quick and thorough investigation. Captain Tshilate said the suspect was expected to appear in the Heidelberg Magistrates Court soon.
