  THE Bulls have brought several overseas-based players back home since Jake White took over as director of rugby.  But they are also losing some to overseas teams, Springbok scrumhalf Ivan van Zyl being the latest to leave Loftus Versfeld to join Saracens.  The scrumhalf will join the English side at the end of June, the franchise confirmed on Tuesday.  Van Zyl joined the Bulls in 2014, directly after finishing school across the road at Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool.  The 25-year-old former Junior Springbok made his first-class debut during the 2015 Vodacom Cup campaign and followed that up with his debut in the Carling Currie Cup later that year and his Super Rugby debut the following year.  He earned his first Springbok call-up against Wales in Washington DC and has subsequently amassed six caps in the green and gold.  “Ivan has led our backline alongside the veteran Morné Steyn, extremely well and his keen sense of the game has served our game plan perfectly. His direct approach, speed and strength will be a massive boost for Saracens and we know that he will be an asset to them and wish him well,” said Bulls Director of Rugby Jake White.  Van Zyl expressed his gratitude to the #BullsFamily: “I've always wanted to play for this team. I grew up in Pretoria watching the likes of Fourie du Preez and company. I must thank all involved at Loftus Versfeld for backing me and allowing me to chase my dreams.”
