KAIZER Chiefs have given an update on Khama Billiat's injury - it's all good news. The good news is that the Zimbabwean forward is back training - three and half weeks into his injury. "Khama has started gym exercises and is now out of the boot," said Chiefs in a Tweet. Billiat, who before his injury started all of Chiefs' games this season, making 16 starts in all competitions, was injured during Chiefs 2-0 loss to Maritzburg United last month. He had his right leg bone cracked as a result of an ill-timed attempt at winning the ball late in the first half of the game by Travis Graham. As a result, Billiat was unable to continue in the game as he left the match shortly after the restart. Amakhosi will be without the influential attacking midfielder who has contributed with five assists and a goal in his 16 appearances this season. He was initially billed to be out for two months, but he's made a remarkable recovery. It however remains anybody's guess on when will he back training with the rest of the squad. Meanwhile, midfielder Lebohang Lesako is undergoing rehabilitation in the gym. "He will start running this week," Chiefs said in a statement.
