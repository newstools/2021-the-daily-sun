ACTRESS Zinhle Mabena appeared at the Pretoria Magistrate Court in Tshwane on charges of murder and attempted murder, of her husband, Robert Ngwenya and his body guard this morning. But the prosecutor threw the case out and said that her arrest was unlawful. After spending a night in a holding cell, Zinhle said: "I cannot pretend and begin to explain how traumatic last night was for me to spend a night in police detention. I thank my family, close friends and my legal team for their support and faith in my innocence despite the despicable and utter liars that are spreading against me." In a statement issued by her lawyer, Joshua Lazarus of Shapiro and Ledwaba Incorporated it read: "I act on behalf of Zinhle and confirm that she was unlawfully taken into custody yesterday but is now a free woman after the NPA declined to place the matter on the roll, because of the preposterous nature of the allegations against our client.
