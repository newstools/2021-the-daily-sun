TWO suspects, aged 23 and 44, were arrested for fuel theft and tempering with essential infrastructure in Vosman, Mpumalanga, on Thursday, 25 February. They were arrested by members of the Mpumalanga Tactical Response Team, Middelburg-based Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation, Local Criminal Record Centre Witbank and Fidelity Security. According to Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, the arrest followed information received from the drone team that was on duty, working on the pipe lines when they saw suspicious suspects along the Transnet fuel pipe line. “Security made an observation and saw the suspects digging the ground on top of the pipe line. The matter was reported to Fidelity Security, and it summoned law enforcements. The team arrived and arrested two suspects out of six. Others managed to escape,” Sekgotodi said. “It was discovered that the pipe line was damaged, but no spillage was detected. The equipment used during the crime was seized and will now form part of an ongoing investigation. The suspects will appear before the Emalahleni Magistrates Court on Monday, 1 March 2021.”
