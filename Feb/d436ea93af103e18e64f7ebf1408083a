FOOTBALL is about gamesmanship and fair play.  But that is seldom the case when it comes to African football where cheating is rife in Caf club competitions.  However, Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt does not condone dirty tactics teams often apply to win Champions League matches.    However, one needn’t look any further than the theatrics and the time-wasting tactics from the visitors’ goalkeeper, Moussa Camara, to know what Amakhosi were up against and what they will be facing in their group C campaign.  “You’ll get these things more so at home than away. But that is part of the game on the African continent. But you’ve got to get better. These things make you stronger,” said Hunt. “What I often say is; what goes around comes around. If you cheat today, it will come back to you tomorrow. I have emphasised to my players that they should be honest, stay honest, stay true to the course and play the game properly. In the long run, you will benefit.  “We scored two goals – possibly the one was off-side, but I don't think the other one was. "So, it worked but you can stand and talk all day... It was a good effort from the players – that's the most important thing; the intensity was better; the attitude was good.” Chiefs will next tackle Wydad Athletic in their second group match in Ougadougou on Sunday.
