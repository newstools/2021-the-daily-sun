SPOKESMAN of self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri has said a website asking for donations for Bushiri’s birthday is fake. Ephraim Nyondo denied allegations made on social media by people accusing Bushiri of extorting money. The leader of Enlightened Christian Gathering Church celebrated his birthday on Saturday. Social media users were bothered by allegations he asked for $100 (about R1 400) from each of his followers. Solomon Izang Ashoms wrote on Facebook: “Charlatan Bushiri asked for donations for his birthday on his site. Don’t waste your money donating to a fraudster millionaire in a country and continent of many poor people.” Nang Jantjie wrote: “Jesus never asked for gifts or money from his disciples. Why are people fooled by Bushiri?” Kgalalelo Molefi said: “Hai! This Malawian’s juju is powerful and his followers will pay big money.” Although Bushiri’s church denied the allegations, his followers rushed to defend him. Thulane Dladla wrote: “Celebrating someone’s life is better than celebrating someone’s downfall. Send me the account for Major 1.” Steven Shangogo wrote: “People give freely because they know what the prophet has done for them.” Meanwhile, Bushiri’s wife Mary wrote a birthday message on her Facebook page. “A hero is born, an icon is born. A gift to humanity, especially to me, was born today,” she wrote. Bushiri and his wife remain the most wanted couple in Mzansi after they fled and violated their bail conditions last year.
