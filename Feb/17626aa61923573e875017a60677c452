THERE are no preparations for the reopening of Phumlani Primary School in Hluhluwe, northern KZN, on 15 February. Parents allegedly locked the school gate yesterday after they realised the school principal, who they indicated they didn’t want, returned to the school. One of the parents, Sbongile Ngubane (47), said they were not happy with how the principal was employed. “We heard he was employed because he’s a National Teachers’ Union member and not because he aced the employment process,” Sbongile told the People’s Paper. “We discovered the SGB disqualified teachers they were supposed to choose because the teachers are members of the South African Democratic Teachers Union. “We heard the SGB doesn’t want a teacher affiliated with the ANC to lead the school when there’s one available who’s affiliated with the IFP.” Natu is affiliated to the IFP and Sadtu to the ANC. Sbongile said the parents were not going to allow that to happen. Contacted for comment, SGB chairwoman Eunice Khumalo hung up the phone. Daily Sun couldn’t reach the principal, whose cellphone was on voicemail. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said only the MEC had the right to close the school. “The parents are causing unnecessary problems because, at a time when other schools are busy with preparations, theirs is locked and will stay behind,” said Mahlambi. “They were supposed to lodge their grievances with the district and the right channels would have been followed.” Mahlambi said they’d contact the district to check on the situation.
