BAROKA FC are dreaming big in the Nedbank Cup! The Limpopo-based outfit aim to challenge for this season’s Nedbank Cup and qualify to play for the Caf Confederation Cup. The Ke Yona winners automatically qualify for the Confederation of African Football’s second biggest tournament. The DStv Premiership outfit host struggling GladAfrica Championship side Cape Town Spurs in the Ke Yona’s last-32 round at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Monday (5pm). Baroka have been in the semi-finals of this competition twice. Bakgaga first reached the last four of this competition in 2011 while still an amateur side playing in the Vodacom League (third tier) when they beat likes of cup giants Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows, with former Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) CEO Sello Chokoe as their coach. Last season, under Dylan Kerr, they reached the semi-final again but lost to Bloemfontein Celtic. This season, Baroka manager Richard Mashabane yesterday told SunSport that playing in African competitions is one of the club’s biggest goals. “Look, the Nedbank Cup gives any team a chance to play in Confederation Cup and we would love to test ourselves against other African teams,” Mashabane said. “We’ve reached the quarter-final and two semi-finals of this competition and this time we want to go all the way and get an opportunity to play in Confederation Cup, like what TS Galaxy did two seasons ago when they were still in the Championship. Galaxy showed that anything is possible in football.” Galaxy caused one of the biggest upsets in the Ye Kona Cup history when they beat Chiefs 1-0 in the final. Since the club won promotion to the PSL five seasons ago, Baroka have won one major trophy in the top flight after lifting the Telkom Knockout in 2018 with former Chiefs striker Wedson Nyirenda leading them. Bakgaga will pin their hopes on the experience of Thami Masiya to upset Spurs on Monday.
