CAPE Umoya United head coach Roger De Sa has confirmed to SunSport that Gabriel Nyoni will be out for the rest of the season. The Zimbabwean born forward sustained a career-threatening injury last Tuesday when his side drew 0-0 against Richards Bay FC in their GladAfrica Championship fixture. He was on the receiving end of crude tackle which resulted in him being taken off with just 15 minutes on the clock and was rushed to a hospital. On his official Twitter page, the player said: “I hope it’s not the end. Never thought one day I will be in this condition. Lord Heal me.” His coach revealed that the player’s surgery was a success. “He will not play again this season,” De Sa revealed. “He sustained a double ankle injury, broken and a fractured foot. He has some of his bones broken it is really bad. He is currently in a private hospital in Richards Bay where he is being treated. He will be discharged sometime this week because he had to stay in the hospital for seven days after the surgery because of pain.” De Sa added: “He is not likely to return this season. We wish him a speedy recovery.” Nyoni joined the Cape Town-based outfit last August after he was released from his contract by Maritzburg United where he enjoyed a one-year stint. Cape Umoya are seventh in the Championship standings with 19 points from 14 matches. They are just five points behind the four leading teams who each have 24 points. De Sa says he is satisfied with their performance so far. “It has not been that bad for us this season. We have dropped a couple of points here and there but I believe we will get better there is still a long way to go.”
