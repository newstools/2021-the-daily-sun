FOR footballers, there rarely is a better feeling on the field of play than scoring a goal. But some footballers take it a step too far when they show their excitement in celebration of a goal. Raul Bobadilla Bobadilla, who plays for Club Guarani in Paraguay's Primera División, was so ecstatic with his goal against Libertad back in December that he partially flashed his 4-5 during his celebration. The 33-year-old had scored the third goal in his side’s 3-1 win before he whipped off his shirt and GPS vest and then pulled his shorts down for a few seconds. Bobadilla told reporters after the match that he hoped his wife did not see the over exuberant goal celebration. "I regret my celebration. I hope my wife didn't see it,” as quoted by The Sun. "She should remain calm. It's all for her."
