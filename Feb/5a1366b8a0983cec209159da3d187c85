KAIZER Chiefs are trapped in limbo and are unsure whether or not they will make it to Morocco for their Caf assignment. Amakhosi are scheduled to play Wydad Casablanca in their Caf Champions League group C at Mohammed V Stadium Casablanca on Saturday. However, they cannot travel without the requisite visas. South Africa is flagged as high risk in terms of the Covid-19 pandemic and visitors from these shores may not be allowed entry into Morocco due to the strict Covid-19 regulation in the North African country. "Due to the hold up with the issuing of visas to Morocco and lack of communication from the Moroccan football federation and authorities on the matter that involves Kaizer Chiefs travelling to the north African country, the club had no option but to move their travel to tomorrow, pending the resolution of the matter and cooperation from all the relevant parties," said the club. "Kaizer Chiefs can confirm that the club has fulfilled all the requirements needed for their travel, including all Covid-19 protocols requirements for their trip. After all the planning and again waiting at the Moroccan Embassy in Pretoria, the club have still not been issued with visas required for entry into Morocco for their maiden CAF group stage match against Wydad Athletic. "The club remains in limbo as all lines of communication seem to have been shut down as the club and Safa have not received any correspondence from the Moroccan authorities on this matter." Amakhosi, however, are hopeful they could still travel, pinning their hopes on the football governing body and the embassy. "We will continue to collaborate with Safa and the SA Embassy in Morocco to try and engage Caf so that we can get the matter resolved," the club said. The club is still waiting for the issuing of visas and will once again attempt to obtain visas from the Moroccan Embassy in Pretoria today." Chiefs are drawn in Group C with Wydad Casablanca, Guinean side Horoya and Angolan team Petro de Luanda.
