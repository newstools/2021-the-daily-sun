The survey, conducted between 3 and 9 February, received responses from 4 309 principals across the nine provinces which amounts to 19% of schools nationally.

"In terms of overall readiness for compliance, 57% of the schools nationally reported on 9 February that they are confident that they can comply with all Covid-19 protocols." Come Monday, pupils are expected to come to school with their own masks, with the exception of Grades 1 and 8 who will be provided with them. "Schools were asked to indicate if learners had been told to bring back the face masks from home or the ones they had last year. On average, 50% of the schools nationally indicated they informed the learners. The majority of schools in the Western Cape [79%] have told learners to bring face masks," the survey found.Â Survey graphic illustrating school readinessFive of the country's teachers unions have published the second school readiness survey for 2021 ahead of schools opening on Monday.SuppliedIn terms of teachers' willingness to vaccinate for Covid-19, it found: "Fifty-two percent of principals nationally agree or strongly agree that they will take the vaccine when it becomes available.
