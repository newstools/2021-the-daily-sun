TWO Somali businessmen aged 23 and 25 were killed in their spaza shop on Friday. Now Somali traders in KwaZakhele, Port Elizabeth, are in hiding, fearing for their lives. “I heard several gunshots and customers were shouting for help. I took cover,” said a resident (55). “The cops quickly came and rescued us. Two suspects got away in a white Mazda bakkie, leaving soft drinks and packets of cigarettes scattered in front of the shop.” A leader of Amabutho, a vigilante group with links to uMkhonto weSizwe veterans, said: “I saw this bakkie being chased by cops passing by in our area. “We condemn this act of criminality. We’ll meet with the police forum and the Somali business community and work out what we can do.” Colonel Priscilla Naidu confirmed the incident. “Detectives are investigating two cases of murder and business robbery,” Naidu told Daily Sun. “Provincial police warned the Somali traders to be on the lookout for suspicious activity near their shops. “All names of the deceased are withheld until their next of kin are informed.” Reporting on another attack, Captain Gerda Swarts said: “A 37-year-old Somali shop owner was shot dead in his shop in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage, and his partner was wounded in an attack on Friday night at about 11.30pm.”
