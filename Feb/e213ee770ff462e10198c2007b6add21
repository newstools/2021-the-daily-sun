ANGRY residents have called for the immediate removal of the principal of Moses Mnisi High School in Cottondale, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. The principal is accused of corruption and abuse. Frightened teachers stood outside the school on Monday and watched helplessly as divided residents and parents fought and hurled words at each other. One group wanted the principal gone, while the other said he was innocent. More than 33 teachers boycotted the principal, accusing him of assaulting two teachers. But he was allegedly not found guilty by the Mpumalanga Department of Education but never returned to the school. Members of one group said they didn’t want him there. “We’re not against our kids’ education, but we want the truth. We won’t let the teachers or our kids go in because they’re not safe.” Members of the other group fought back. “To hell with you if don’t want this principal. He did nothing wrong,” said one member. “You’re being bought by factional groups to oust him. If the principal goes, know it now that we will close the circuit office as well.” Education circuit boss Godfrey Maaboi addressed the residents in the presence of the police, pending a meeting with parents, the school and the department on Tuesday, 9 February. The department had not responded to a request for comment at the time of going to print.
