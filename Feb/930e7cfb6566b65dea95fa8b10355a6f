A video has been circulating on social media showing a new tactic hijackers use. While it’s not clear when the video was taken or how common this modus operandi is, it still serves as a reminder of the importance of hijack awareness when people are driving. The managing director of MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert, said the video appeared to show a woman who was hijacked as she entered a highway behind another vehicle. “Even though this was completely unexpected, there are still some basic techniques to help detect a potentially dangerous situation immediately and then give you the chance and space to escape that situation. “The driver was blocked in by the hijacker’s car that preceded her and soon by traffic behind her. A keyway to prevent yourself from being in this position is to ensure that you keep at least three metres between yourself and the car in front of you when stationary,” said Herbert. “Admittedly, it would have been difficult to move around the hijackers in this video as their position appears to be carefully chosen but, in many instances, it could give you the space to move around quickly and safely.” Awareness of potentially dangerous situations is also important to give yourself the best chance.  “Quickly moving around a car that suddenly and expectedly stops, can make all the difference. “Reacting this way, however, is something you need to train yourself to do. “When driving, accept that someone stopping suddenly in this manner may be a threat and that your best response is to immediately move around the obstacle. “Often, however, this may not be possible. Oncoming cars, or as is the case in this video, people (criminals or otherwise) make this impossible. In this instance, rather surrender the car than subject yourself to physical harm by fighting with the hijackers or driving straight at them. A car can be replaced but a life cannot, nor the consequences of a rash decision be reversed.”
