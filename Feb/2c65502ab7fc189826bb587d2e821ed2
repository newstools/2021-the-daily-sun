MARITZBURG United coach Ernst Middendorp is under immense pressure. According to SunSport sources, the Team of Choice are considering sacking the former Kaizer Chiefs coach, who arrived on 26 November last year with the aim of arresting the team’s slide but that hasn’t been the case despite promising early signs. Maritzburg lost 1-0 to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in a DStv Premiership match in what was the bottom of the table encounter at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday. After the game heads dropped, which is a sign of concern. Maritzburg chairman Farook Kadodia was seen talking to his directors clearly unhappy with what he had seen. Kadodia said he’s worried about the team’s poor form. “We are all are concerned. Anybody who is fighting for his life has to be concerned,” said Kadodia. “We are dealing with the issue of the coach and players.” However, Kadodia did say Middendorp is going nowhere despite the team’s poor form: “The coach won’t be lost. He’ll be here.” This was a fourth league loss on the bounce for the club. They have now given their relegation rivals some breathing space. After the game, Middendorp declined to speak to press and delegated his assistant coach Delron Buckley to fulfil his media duties. Middendorp, who is in his fourth term at the club, previously saved Maritzburg from relegation in the 2015-16 season when they were going through tough times. But Maritzburg are now second bottom of the table with nine points from 15 games.
