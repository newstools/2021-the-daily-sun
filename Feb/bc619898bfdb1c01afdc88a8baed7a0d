MUSA Nyatama is gradually working his way into the Swallows FC team, one match at a time. The former Orlando Pirates midfielder has been used mostly as a substitute so far this season. However, he seems to be getting closer to securing a regular starting berth for the Dube Birds. He has made eight appearances for Brandon Truter’s side this season, coming off the bench on seven occasions. The 33-year-old’s only start for the Dube Birds came in the Nedbank Cup first round match against Cape United. Nyatama played the full 90 minutes as Swallows saw off the GladAfrica Championship side to book their spot in the last-16 of Ke Yona Cup. He is now hoping to crack the starting line-up in the DStv Premiership when The Birds face high-flying AmaZulu in their next match. The clash will take place at Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). “It feels good to finally start a match,” said Nyatama. “It was my first start of the season for the club. I still feel like there are some moments where I can improve and be more helpful towards the team. “We are happy to have progressed to the next stage of the competition but I feel like there are a few things we could have done better. “But it’s a work in progress and with hard work and perseverance, we will get there.” Nyatama is expecting a tough encounter against one of the in-form teams in the league at the moment in Usuthu. Benni McCarthy’s charges have won their last four matches on the spin in all competitions. They are currently on a six-match unbeaten run with their last defeat coming nearly a month ago. AmaZulu are seventh on the log with 21 points from 15 matches, seven behind Swallows who occupy third position. “It won’t be an easy game,” Nyatama insisted. “They are in a good run of form but we will try to collect maximum points. We are playing at home, so we must make use of that advantage. “We will try our best to continue making good progress.”
