A TAXI driver from Eastern Cape will rot in jail for raping a commuter. The East London Regional Court sentenced 35-year-old Anda Majavu to life imprisonment for raping a 24-year-old female commuter in 2019. According to NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakazi, it was discovered during the trial that the victim was hitchhiking from Mdantsane to East London when she was picked up by Majavu at about 9am. Ngcakazi said: “Majavu first dropped off another passenger and when it was just the two of them in the vehicle he started to threaten her with a broken bottle top and drove to an isolated area where he raped her. He drove off with her and continued to threaten her not to try to escape. He then found another secluded area near Da Gama Textiles where he raped her again, gagging her mouth and bounding her legs, arms and wrists. He then pushed her into a ditch, covered her with shrubs and left her there. She managed to free herself, although the material used to bound her cut into her flash. She ran towards the road where she was rescued by a motorist who took her to the Cambridge Police Station. The police arrested Majavu a few days later. During the trial, Majavu claimed that the victim initiated the sexual encounter. He was, however, unable to explain to court as to why the victim had injuries.” Prosecutor Thando Feni, in aggravation of sentence, asked the court for a life sentence because of the horrific nature of the crime.
