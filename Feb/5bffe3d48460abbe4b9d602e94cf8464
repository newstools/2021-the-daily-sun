MANDLA Ncikazi’s position as Golden Arrows coach is not a good one at the moment. Ncikazi has admitted the morale in his dressing room is low after the loss to AmaZulu in the Nedbank Cup last-32 at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium this past weekend. It leaves Ncikazi with a huge task of lifting up his boys’ spirits ahead of their DStv Premiership clash against Stellenbosch FC at Danie Craven Stadium tomorrow (5pm). It was just Arrows’ second loss in 15 matches in all competitions this season. Their other defeat was the 4-2 loss against Cape Town City on 24 January in Cape Town in a league match. It saw the club’s best ever start in the PSL era of being unbeaten in 11 games ending at the hands of City. But Ncikazi was concerned after his side dropped their heads when Usuthu scored a late equaliser to take the match into extra time and eventually a penalty shoot-out. He hopes the players will bounce back against a Stellies side who are winless in the last five games in all competitions. “It’s a mammoth task and the morale in the changing room is low after the game wasn’t great,” Ncikazi said. “I’m worried about how their mental state will be. But it is important that we take the positives.” Arrows have not beaten Stellies since they won promotion to the PSL top flight at the beginning of last season. In head to head, Arrows have won only once against them in six meeting. They have lost three of the last five matches against them. Arrows solitary win over Stellies was when the club was known as Vasco Da Gama in September 2010. Despite the club’s record not looking good against Stellies, Ncikazi is hopeful things will change. “The negatives become lessons,” said Ncikazi who will be without Ntsako Makhubela due to suspension. “I know we have a good team and we have players who are willing, so I’m confident and optimistic that we’ll be stronger than we were against AmaZulu.”
