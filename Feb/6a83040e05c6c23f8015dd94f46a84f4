MASKANDI artist Phumlani “Imfezemnyama” Khumalo has officially opened his own studio. The studio, which is named Amabunjwa Records and is in the Joburg CBD, was opened late last year, but operated partially. Imfezemnyama said he has been buying instruments since last year. “I cannot say the studio is fully equipped, but I have the most needed instruments. But I officially opened it this week. At this point, I can say the studio is fully operational,” he said. “So far I’ve spent quite a bit on this studio, including the equipment. Fortunately, I’ve been investing money and that’s how I accumulated capital.” He said he chose the name Amabunjwa Records as it is already a brand and a number of big artists had already released their work under Amabunjwa Records. “My studio doesn’t necessarily work with maskandi artists, but is an inclusive studio. For example, my own album titled Lakokota was released in this studio. “I’ve also released the likes of Intaba YaseDubai, Big Zulu, Zakwe and Skandi Kid. As we speak, their songs are played on radio stations,” he said. Imfezemnyama told Daily Sun it has always been his dream to open his studio. “I could have chosen another way to make a second income, but chose this one. This is because I understand music. It was also natural for me to establish a studio because I’ve grown in the industry. I understand a number of genres. As a result, it is high time I start sharing my knowledge and music skills,” he said.
