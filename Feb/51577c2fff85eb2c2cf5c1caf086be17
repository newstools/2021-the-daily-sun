POLOKWANE City have appointed Johnny Ferreira as head coach in a bid to return to the Premier Soccer League. Ferreira has replaced MacDonald Makhubedu who left the Limpopo side to join GladAfrica Championship rivals Sekhukhune United last month. Ironically, Makhubedu replaced Ferreira who was shown the door by Sekhukhune following a string of poor results. City boss Johnny Mogaladi had given assistant coach Willy Moloto the chance to prove his worth on an interim basis. But the job to guide the club back into the land of milk and honey was too much to handle for the young mentor as he lost three league games and drawn twice during his short spell at the helm. Although he guided the side to a 2-0 win over fellow Championship side Steenberg United in the Nedbank Cup last 32 round match at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday, Mogaladi seems to have already made up his mind to bring the much travelled Ferreira. Mogaladi could not confirm nor deny Ferreira’s appointment as he said: “I am busy right now. "I mean  you are running your business and I am running mine, so I will call you when I am finished what I am doing.”
