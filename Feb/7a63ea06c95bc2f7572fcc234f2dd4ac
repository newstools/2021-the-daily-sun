DANCER and entertainer Zodwa Wabantu has opened her heart and pockets. The talented media personality, who is currently running her egg and chicken business, has revealed that she’ll be giving away eggs worth R3 000 to students and other people. She will be giving away the eggs on Friday, 12 February in Randburg at Eleven45 lounge. Speaking to Daily Sun, Zodwa said: “It has been a roller-coaster and the pandemic has brought a lot of challenges into people’s lives.” “So since I have eggs that I can give people, I decided to do a giveaway. It’ll boost them as some kids are going back to school and they’ll need lunch boxes. “It’s not a competition, if they see me tomorrow they can just come and collect, no one will be judging them. This is for the better good of the community.” ASLO READ | SAMAS AT A RECORD HIGH Zodwa further explained why she has taken on this initiative. “Honestly speaking, I did this because I sympathise with everyone.
