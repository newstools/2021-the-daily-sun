FOUR thugs had a copper cable that they had to share. But it appears that two of the thugs became greedy and wanted the cable for themselves. Residents from Khutsong near Carletonville, Gauteng, heard gunshots as the thugs fought. But by the time the cops arrived, they found two bodies lying on the ground. Sergeant Linkie Lefakane said after preliminary investigations two suspects, aged between 38 and 42, were arrested on Friday. She said the suspects were expected to appear in the Oberholzer Magistrates Court on two charges of murder and possession of stolen copper cable. “Two bodies with gunshots wounds were spotted by a passerby in an open veld near Khutsong.” She said the community allegedly heard gunshots at about 6.10am. “We were woken by the loud sound of the guns. It was as if they were near us in the street,” said a resident. “We are tired of shootings in our area. We can’t be raising kids in an environment with so such violence.” Lefakane said police found a firearm believed to be unlicensed in one of the suspects’ clothes. She said although a long piece of cable was found, they were still investigating the motive of the murders. She said both dead suspects were still unknown and police were investigating the motive for their killing. The district commissioner, Major-General Fred Kekana welcomed the arrests and commended his officers for their swift reaction in making arrests.
