TWO Mozambique nationals, who were allegedly arrested for operating an illegal gold refinery lab at Sundra farm in Mpumalanga last month, will remain in jail. The suspects, aged 17 and 34, appeared before the Delmas Magistrates Court on Friday, 12 February. The case was postponed to Wednesday, 17 February, for the Xitsonga court interpreter. According to Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, the two were bust on 15 January during a joint operation by the Hawks and Organised Crime Investigation team, members of Sundra SAPS, Local Record Criminal Centre, Forensic Science Laboratory and Evander Gold Mine. “Our team swiftly responded on the information received at Sundra SAPS about a truck that was driving along the neighbouring farms without headlights. Upon arrival, the suspects fled the scene and police gave chase. They were then arrested and a search was later conducted at the premises. It led to the discovery of two illegal refinery laboratories operating on the farm where a group of illegal miners were employed to illegally process the gold,” said Sekgotodi. “Three pendukas were found which were electrically operated, and gold bearing material was also found and confiscated for further investigation. The suspects appeared in court but remained in custody.”
