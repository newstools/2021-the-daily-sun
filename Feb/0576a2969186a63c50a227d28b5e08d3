I’ve often heard people talk about the “sweet spot”. This is the spot or area where luck and magic lies, whether one is referring to sports or life in general. Everyone has a sweet spot. And, the same applies to sex. Often referred to as the G-spot, many of us have our sweet spot when it comes to sex. According to experts, unlike our female counterparts, the man’s G-spot is a bit obvious as it lies in the prostate. What makes the male prostate the sweet spot, you might ask? According to human anatomy, this sensitive, walnut-sized gland is located within the body, behind the penis. It contains tons of nerve endings, making it a perfect target for pleasure. Many sexologists agree that some men are able to orgasm from prostate stimulation alone. This body part is most easily stimulated through the rectum and responds well to very gentle touch, whether from lubricated fingers or toys designed to be prostate massagers. As they often say in board games: touch is a move!
