LEAVING your vehicle at a car wash, you’d expect to find it spick and span. But when Italian soccer player Genoa FC goalkeeper Federico Marchetti left his R5 million Ferrari 812 at the car wash, all went south. He left his car to be washed and expected it to be returned to him at his team’s training base afterwards. The car wash worker driving the Ferrari lost control of the exotic vehicle and crashed into five parked cars. No one was hurt in the incident. Video footage shows emergency services on the scene doing a clean-up.
