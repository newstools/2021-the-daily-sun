TIME AND TIME again, the brave gogo dashed into the raging fire to save her five grandkids. And she managed to save four of them, but the smoke and the fumes became too much. GOGO HEARD THE SCREAMS AS HER GRANDDAUGHTER PERISHED IN THE ANGRY FLAMES. The eight-year-old Nokuthula Khumalo-Tshabalala died in the fire on Friday night after Maria Msimango (54) from Everest squatter camp in Springs had saved the others. Her seven-roomed shack was destroyed in the flames with the granddaughter inside  “I’m devastated. It hurts that I couldn’t save her,” she said. “Gogo’s right hand and right side of her face were burned as she was pulling the kids out of the fire. “She was taken to hospital for treatment and came back the following morning.” Gogo Maria said they don’t know what caused the fire. “It started in their bedroom, which was at the back where we don’t have electricity,” she said. “The light bulb was broken and we don’t use candles.   She said the mother of the dead girl, Tumi Tshabalala (38), has been hit hard by the incident. Tumi is the mother of three of the kids, aged between 15 and 18, as well as the eight-year-old. “She doesn’t stay with gogo and lives in Springs. “The fifth child is the child of one of gogo’s other children. “She’s been crying non-stop. It’s hard on her to accept.” Tumi was too devastated to speak. Gogo said they lost everything. The family appealed for donations to help them rebuild their home. Ward 72 branch secretary, Bongani Mfombela, visited the family to donate blankets and said they were going to bring groceries. Captain Johannes Ramphora said a case of inquest was opened at Springs cop shop.
