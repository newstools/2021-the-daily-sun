A suspect was bust in a shack near the Klerksdorp dumping site in North West on Friday for the unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. The arrest happened during an operation by the police’s Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Illicit Mining Team at about 6.30pm. Police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh confirmed the suspect was arrested after cops conducted a search of a shack near the Klerksdorp dumping site. “During the search, 53 9mm live ammunitions and three 9mm pistols with magazines were found,” Myburgh said. The suspect, who is said to be in his late 20s, is expected to appear this week in the Klerksdorp Magistrates Court. District commissioner Major-General Suzette Pretorius commended the team for the arrest. “Confiscation of the firearms are frequently used during illicit mining activities and the commission of serious crimes,” she said. Myburgh said the case will be investigated by the Hawks.
