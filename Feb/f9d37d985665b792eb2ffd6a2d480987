AFTER the total lockdown was announced last year, Millicent Ngwekazi (49) and her four kids began cooking for and feeding families who didn’t have food to survive during the pandemic. Millicent from Moreleta Park, Tshwane and her children have been spending their Saturdays cooking for the poor since March. “When I realised how many people were struggling, I got very hurt and decided to help out,” Millicent told Daily Sun. “We go around in the east of the city to hand out food.” She said that she’s been using money from her pocket, but she has spoken to her boss who said he would help her. When the people of Plastic View see the family arriving in the area, they line up for food. Resident Innocentia Damon (24) said their lives have been saved by the family. “We look forward to receiving the food. We have been starving for a long time,” Innocentia said. “What this family is doing for us is beautiful. You can see that they’re doing this from their hearts,” she said. Another resident said his children always reminded him to get them food. “Their food is delicious and we are in love with Millicent’s food,” he said. “We believe God will bless this lady and her family. “This woman deserves blessings and more because not everyone does what she is doing. “People only think about themselves, but this woman comes here every Saturday without fail to help us.”
