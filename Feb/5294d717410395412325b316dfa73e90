RICHARDS Bay are having a season to remember so far. They are responsible for the shock elimination of Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs from the Nedbank Cup. The Natal Rich Boyz are also leading the pack in the race for promotion to the DStv Premiership. They currently sit at the top of the GladAfrica Championship table with 27 points from 15 matches – three clear of their nearest chasers, Sekhukhune United. And coach Simo Dladla has admitted that having done so well up to this point, he would be bitterly disappointed to finish the season empty-handed. He has targeted the league and automatic promotion to the top-flight as their main goal, but believes winning the Ke Yona Cup would be ideal as well. Dladla will take his impressive team, who are unbeaten in their last 12 matches in all competitions, to Mpumalanga for a Nedbank Cup last 16 clash with TS Sporting. The encounter will take place at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday (3pm). “There is that little pressure to win a trophy,” said Dladla. “We have to do something special this season. I have always been saying that I think I have acquired enough experience in this league to win a cup. “We only have the league and the Nedbank Cup. We have to deliver something this season. The main priority though is the league. “We just have to bring the same attitude and application we showed against Chiefs.” But TS Sporting will not make it easy for the Natal Rich Boyz. Abantu Bemthetho, as Sporting are also known, also eliminated a big fish in 2019 Nedbank Cup champions TS Galaxy in the last 32 and they believe they have Richards Bay’s number. “I believe they got it easy against Chiefs because they did not know much about them,” said Sporting coach Kabelo Sibiya. “We know exactly what to expect because we have played them before. We were able to avoid defeat and we gave them a good run. It will be another exciting match.”
