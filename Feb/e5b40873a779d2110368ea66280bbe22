WINLESS in two matches, Kaizer Chiefs face a herculean task getting as far as the knockout stages in the Caf Champions League. Their last-16 round hopeswere practically extinguished after they crashed 4-0 to Wydad Athletic in their group C match in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso on Sunday. Of course, there are still points to fight for in the remaining four fixtures. But the odds seem to be stacked heavily against Gavin Huntâ€™s men. Battling on two fronts with a limited squad remains the biggest challenge, as seen with the result against Wydad. The scoreline suggested it a one-sided affair. But it certainly wasn't. Amakhosi fell behind as early as the seventh minute when Mohamed Onajem connected with a Muafi Ellafi cross to put the hosts ahead. Ayoub El Kaabi added the second on the stroke of halftime, just as Amakhosi were in the ascendancy and looking to equalise. But the Soweto giants did not drop their heads as they pushed Wydad back, Samir Nurkovic, Leonardo Castro and Kearyn Baccus coming close to scoring. But their momentum was broken when Simon Msuva volleyed in the third before Yahya Jabrane converted a last-minute penalty. To add salt to injury, Ramahlwe Mphahlele was shown a red card for a dubious handball which resulted in the penalty.
