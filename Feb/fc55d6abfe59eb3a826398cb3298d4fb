FUGITIVE and self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri's two
daughters and his mother-in-law have allegedly been stopped from leaving Malawi
for Kenya. The trio has apparently been turned away at Kamuzu
international airport in the country on their way to Kenya according to eNCA.
It is believed that the daughters were heading to Kenya for medical reasons. Before Shepard and Mary Bushiri pulled the greatest escape
from South Africa to Malawi, their children had skipped the country while the
couple was still in police custody after the lengthy bail application hearings. Few days after they were granted bail with a hefty price tag
of R200 000 each in their R100 million fraud case, the Bushiris skipped the
country through back doors. The Bushiri's forfeited their bail amount of R400 000 in
total including their fancy house in centurion after they violated their bail
condition given to them by the Pretoria High Court. South Africa has since filled extradition papers to try and
get the couple brought back to South Africa to stand trial for their fraud
case. More information to follow.
