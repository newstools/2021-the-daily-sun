THE Department of Education in Mpumalanga has reinstated temporary and contract teachers. It has also processed the payments of at least 1 090 teachers. Education MEC Bonakele Majuba confirmed the process is still ongoing and if everything goes according to the plan, all outstanding payments may be finalised next week. “This will include the salaries of Grade R practitioners,” said the MEC, who apologised for the inconvenience caused. Majuba also welcomed about 33 000 teachers who reported for duty at schools within the province last week after the school holiday break. “We’re grateful and appreciate the crucial role played by teachers as the backbone of the growth and development objectives of the nation,” said Majuba. “It’s for this reason that teachers will always be valued and appreciated by the department. “In addition, the department also wishes to state its position that temporary teachers and teachers appointed on a contractual basis and Grade R practitioners will receive their January salary this Thursday.” The payment process follows the reinstatement of their employment contracts in line with the resolutions of the provincial education Labour relations council of 8 December 2020.
