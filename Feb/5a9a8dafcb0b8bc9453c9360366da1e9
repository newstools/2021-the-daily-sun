Manaka, who has a son with actor boyfriend Ntuthuko Mdletshe, recently had an interview with Daily Sun in which she said she didn’t want her children to grow up subscribing to gender roles because she doesn’t subscribe to such. “There’s nothing special about men, so I don’t want my kids seeing gender roles. I want my kids to always know there are no gender roles and they mustn’t look at people based on that. They must just see human beings,” she said. Manaka, who is a mother of three, said she was enjoying every minute of being a mum again although it wasn’t anything new to her.
