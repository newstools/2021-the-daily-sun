MOROCCAN side Wydad Casablanca and CR Belouizdad from Algeria on Saturday were given a 24-hour deadline to provide neutral venues for the CAF Champions League fixtures against Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns, respectively. Both fixtures that would have seen Chiefs travel to Morocco and Sundowns to Algeria were called off as both teams were denied traveling visas due to the home countries' Covid-19 restrictions. The South African teams took issue with the failure to be issued with the necessary documents as they had "fulfilled all the requirements needed for their travel, including all Covid-19 protocols requirements for their trip". Sundowns also confirmed that they had been denied entry into Algeria even though they "had already been secured through the Algerian embassy a week ago". CAF has now issued an ultimatum to both African opponents to find a neutral venue by Sunday or forfeit the points in the group stage clash. -SPORT24
