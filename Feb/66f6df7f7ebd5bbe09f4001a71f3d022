At least five people were killed in a multi-car accident. Itâ€™s reported that more than 100 cars were involved in the crash that happened in Fort Worth, Texas in the US on Thursday morning, 11 February. The crash occurred shortly after a winter storm passed through with rain and snow. Numerous tow trucks were called to the scene and it took a while to disperse the wreck. Here at the scene in North Fort Worth of one of the worse disasters I have ever seen in this area. Pray. Pray hard. 100+ of vehicles... @CBSDFW @CBSNews @ABC @WeatherNation @weatherchannel @ReedTimmerAccu @FoxNews @cnnbrk pic.twitter.com/HFpeJoRA2Q  In one of the videos published by WKYC after the crash, a truck could be seen crashing into several of the cars that were in the pile-up. By the looks of things this was due to the truck driver not being able to stop in time.
