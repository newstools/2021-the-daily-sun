PRAYERS are pouring in for the speedy recovery of King Goodwill Zwelithini. The Zulu king was hospitalised in an undisclosed Zululand hospital for a diabetes-related illness. His hospitalisation shocked many people, while others were scared he might be in danger of Covid-19. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala has asked KZN residents to pray for the king’s speedy recovery. “We’re concerned by his majesty’s ill health. His majesty occupies a special place in our society. “His leadership qualities, stature, as well as what he represents in our society cannot be rivalled. “He consistently has been our father figure, our guiding light and an unshakable pillar of strength at various stages of our tumultuous history as a nation.” KZN House of Traditional Leaders chairman Inkosi Phathisizwe Chiliza told Daily Sun: “As traditional leaders, we’re not shaken because we know that the king is closer to God. “We hope he’ll be better soon and continue to lead us in the good way he always does. “People must not be alarmed by the illness of the king, but let us all pray for him to get better soon.” He said they appreciated the good way that the Zulu monarch prime minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, updated the nation about Zwelithini.
