ANGRY parents are demanding answers from the Department of Basic Education. Their children were allegedly placed in schools far from their homes. Some parents said their kids, although living in Tshwane, were placed as far as Mpumalanga. Zoe Mabena from Eersterust told Daily Sun her daughter (6) was placed at Langalibalele Primary School in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. “I want my daughter to be placed in Eersterust. The department told us to lodge a complaint,” she said. “As things stand, my child doesn’t have a place to start school this year.”  She appealed to the department to place her kid in Eersterust. Madibu Mmako from Kosmosdal in Centurion, Tshwane, said her son was at Uitsig Primary School in Centurion last year. But he was placed in a school in Valhalla, which was too far. “I’m disappointed as this situation isn’t right for me and my child,” she said. “The school said it sent an SMS stating we must appeal should the department send our kids to another school. “I appealed, but my son’s application still indicates it’s in the process.” Madibu said the school told her to go to the district office. She didn’t know what would happen as there was no school for her son. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said no pupils were placed in Mpumalanga. “We’ve placed all 40 550 pupils who applied late. We’re aware there are about 3 283 pupils whose placements we’re finalising.”
