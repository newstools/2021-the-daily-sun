ORLANDO Pirates will have to be more clinical upfront if they are to achieve their goals this season. They moved into the fourth spot in the DStv Premiership with a 2-0 victory over Cape Town City at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday. But the scoreline wasn’t the true reflection of the match in which they created more chances than the number of teaspoons at the Nkandla tea party. Deon Hotto and Vincent Pule fired Bucs into the early lead, the two scoring inside the opening five minutes. Hotto latched onto a long well-weighed pass, controlled expertly before beating keeper Peter Leeuwenburgh at the far post with just seconds into the league clash. As the Citizens were still recovering from the early set-back, the host banged in the second as Pule tapped in from a Thembinkosi Lorch low cross. But Zinnbauer is certainly not a happy man. He can’t be after seeing his men stuff up a plethora of chances to crash City into smithereens. The scoreline suggests it was a comfortable win for the Sea Robbers. But far from it. City were unlucky not to equalise from the several chances they created. Their high-line defence cost them dearly and coach Ole Reikenrink might want to rethink this approach against attacking sides. But for Zinnbauer, more work lies ahead. Else, the German will continue to look glum and sour, even when his team is winning.
