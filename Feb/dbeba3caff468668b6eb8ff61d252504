KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt admitted that he is concerned about the club's goalkeeping department after another costly error by Itumeleng Khune. Amakhosi suffered a 2-1 lost against AmaZulu in a DStv encounter at FNB Stadium. Augustine Mulenga scored the first for Usuthu and they went to the break leading by a goal. In the second half, substitute Leonardo Castro pulled a goal back for Chiefs to level the matters, however, a late howler by Khune saw Majoro ounce on his error to score in the 86th minute to which saw AmaZulu collecting maximum points. Khune was unable to connect his punch properly, and Majoro made no mistake putting the ball on the net. This season, Khune has conceded 12 goals in his six starts in the leagueâ€š a fair share of those from errors. A disappointed Hunt said post-match that the goalkeeping department consisting of Khune and Nigerian international Daniel Akpeyi was now a massive concern. "It's something we need to keep working on and hopefully we can improve. "But it's something we certainly need to improve at and it's certainly a big concern. Hunt explained further his reasoning behind recalling Khune to the starting line-up after the Bafana Bafana international had made similar mistakes. "With the goalkeeping department it's certainly been a problem and I thought it was the right time to bring Khune back. Chiefs are sitting ninth in the DStv standings with 18 points after 16 matches. On Saturday, Amakhosi have another tough league outing on Saturday against second-placed SuperSport United at FNB.
