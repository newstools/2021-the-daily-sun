A FUNERAL parlour owner and three other people have been arrested for insurance fraud. The suspects were bust by the Durban Hawks Serious Commercial Crime on Tuesday. It is alleged that two of the suspects took out a life cover using an identity document of the victim. In September 2017, the two lodged a claim alleging that the insured person had died. KZN Hawks spokesman Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said an insurance company’s forensic investigator smelt a rat and probed the claim. “A case of fraud was reported at Durban North Police Station and the case docket was allocated to Hawks members for intensive investigation. “Preliminary investigation revealed that the person whose identity document was used is still alive. A wrong body was allegedly sent to the doctor through the arrested funeral parlour owner, and the two suspects who were supposed to be beneficiaries of the insurance were not related to the insured person,” Mhlongo said. It was further revealed that the fourth suspect allegedly provided the identity document to her accomplices. Mhlongo said a potential loss of R110 000 was halted. All suspects, who are aged between 39 and 61, are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrates Court on Thursday 4 February.
