ZULU monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini has
been admitted in ICU in an undisclosed hospital in Zululand KZN. This was confirmed by Traditional Prime
Minister to the Zulu Monarch and nation Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. In a statement, Buthelezi said the
73-year-old king is diabetic and his glucose levels were being closely
monitored. “Over the past few weeks, several
unstable glucose readings have raised concern and his majesty was required to
visit a hospital in Zululand to attend to this. “Unfortunately, the problem did not fully
resolve and his majesty has had to return to hospital to stabilise his glucose
levels once again. His doctors felt it necessary to place him in ICU to deal
with this thoroughly,” said Buthelezi. He said the unstable glucose was treated
with particular caution due to the risk that diabetes posed under the pandemic. “As is known, scientists have warned that
diabetes is considered a serious comorbidity. Therefore, we wish to assure the
nation that his majesty the king is receiving the necessary care for his
diabetes as he has always done. As always, the Minister of Health is aware of
these arrangements” he said.
