HE believes he was sent by God to spread love in Tshwane. So, Bunda Bunda stands next to a church every morning with a poster and an ANC and EFF flags. Bunda (56), who is homeless, told Daily Sun he has always wanted to be a pastor, but it never happened. “I’m originally from Uganda and came to South Africa 10 years ago. “My mission was to start my own church. Opening a church didn’t work, but I had to go on and do the Lord’s work, which is to share the word of God.” He said he didn’t expect people to pay him. “I write down the scripture for the day on a board and if anyone stops and asks me what the scripture is about, I share the word,” he said. Bunda said he didn’t force people to listen to him. “I just stand there and hold my board. Those who want to listen to me can stop and listen.” He told the People’s Paper that he was against the killing of children and women in Tshwane. “We need to pray hard for what is happening. People are being used as sacrifices for others to get richer. “This will only stop if we let God intervene.” Bunda said his favourite scripture is 1 Corinthians 13. “It’s about love and if we all stay united and love each other, we will make it in life,” he said. Bunda said his wish is to open a church one day. Residents in Soshanguve said they’re always blessed with scriptures from Bunda. “He started standing here a few months ago and everyday he holds a different poster with a new scripture,” said a resident. They said the man was sent by God.
