IT’S no use crying over spilt milk. That’s what SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo believes after watching his side suffer their third loss of the season. Matsatsantsa A Pitori were edged 2-1 in their DStv Premiership clash by Bloemfontein Celtic on Tuesday, thanks to some questionable officiating. The standard of officiating in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) seems to be deteriorating at an alarming rate. Nevertheless, Tembo would not be drawn much on the “offside” goal that cost his side the opportunity to reduce the gap on leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. The Zimbabwean believes moaning about the costly mistake will be futile as it won’t bring back the point his side lost. Tembo would rather focus on getting his side prepared for their next challenge where they hope to bounce back. “It could have been a yard or two offside,” said Tembo referring to Celtic’s winner netted by substitute Motebang Sera. “I don’t know how the linesman could have missed that but from where I was sitting, it looked miles offside. But these things happen in football. “There were other factors that contributed to us not getting the desired result. We didn’t start well and we lacked a bit of luck. “But we can’t dwell too much on the past. We have to move forward and focus on our next match.” The Tshwane outfit, who remain five points behind leaders Sundowns, will hope to get back to winning ways against Cape Town City in their next match at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (5pm). Tembo is wary of a wounded Citizens outfit following their 2-0 loss to Orlando Pirates in their last match. Jan Olde Riekerink’s charges were blitzed by the Buccaneers, conceding twice inside the first five minutes of the match. They will be eager to respond against Matsatsantsa. “It will be another tough game. I think for me they are the best team in the league in terms of structure and how they play. We need to be up for it,” added Tembo.
