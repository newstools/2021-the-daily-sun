AFTER getting a lot of criticism when he played Lindani on The River, Lunga Shabalala has scored another acting gig. This time, the hunky star will be seen in M-Net’s telenovela, Legacy. According to sources, the heart-throb has been in front of the cameras for the show since last November and is slotting in nicely with the cast. “He’s been on set shooting for a couple of months now and he’s very excited to be a part of the cast,” said the source. “He looks forward to showing his haters what he’s made of. This time his character is challenging, and he’s doing really well.” According to another source, Lunga will play Msizi’s long-lost son. “They have been shooting some intense scenes and they work well together. It will soon show when he starts appearing on TV on 25 February. “People who criticised his acting skills will see a different side to him when he debuts in this role. “He owns this role and everyone will see that,” another source said. A third source said the cast loves having him around. “He’s pleasant with people and he gets along with the cast and crew,” said the source. “There’s a chemistry between him and Siyabonga as on-screen father and son. “It’s going to be interesting to see how viewers react to their bond, because it’s genuine.” M-Net’s publicity manager, Nadine Moonsamy, said they will not say anything about Lunga Shabalala’s involvement on Legacy. “Viewers will have to keep their eyes peeled to see how the story unfolds,” said Moonsamy.
