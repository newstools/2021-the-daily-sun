ANC leaders were in bed with business individuals who were most likely influencing decision making at leadership level. This is the revelation in an ANC Integrity Commission (IC) report as told to the commission by State Security Agency deputy minister Zizi Kodwa in an engagement he had with the commission where he submitted himself after corruption allegations. Kodwa was implicated at the State Capture Inquiry after evidence was led by law firm ENS Africa’s forensic director, Stephen Powell, that Kodwa has received over R300 000 from EOH director Jehan Mckay. Kodwa confirmed receiving it but said there’s nothing illegal. According to the IC report, Kodwa then submitted himself to the commission on 5 December where he explained himself and made several revelations. The commission said Kodwa has agreed with it on its approach about the use of money to influence organisational outcomes. “He went further to say there was a connection between private individuals engaged in business and ANC leaders. It’s difficult to exist side-by-side with such individuals without being influenced by them.” The IC said Kodwa had explained he had acted as a conduit for staff members who had approached him for help with funeral costs when there was a death in the family. Kodwa, said the report, was in the process of drafting an affidavit to submit to the State Capture Commission to clarify this, and the IC will afford him an opportunity to do so.
