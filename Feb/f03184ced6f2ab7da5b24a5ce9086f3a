ANC Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini, on Friday, said the dissatisfaction expressed by women in the leading party must not entertain what it did not believe in. “We must never find ourselves in anarchy. We must never make a mistake at the cost of the party between the agenda of the reactionary forces because they have an agenda,” she said. Dlamini said this after a handover of a petition by the North West ANC Women’s League, to fight the purging of women by the Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) and suspension of the membership of five North West legislature members, including premier Job Mokgoro. “When we do things wrongly, continue fighting or don’t follow the processes of the ANC, it is not only the ones that are suspended that get affected,” she warned.  The ANCWL in the North West launched a petition expressing its grievances after two members, Bitsa Lenkopane and Priscilla Williams, were part of the five people whose membership was suspended by the IPC last week. She reminded the league that it represented the working class, single parents as well as domestic and farmworkers, and that it was their responsibility to free the country. “The tactics we use must show maturity. Let us fight fearlessly for the emancipation of the movement. We must never allow anyone to sideline and divide us. We must never allow anyone to give favours through trades so that they can control us. We are enough,” she said. ANCWL acting provincial secretary Lenkopane called for the immediate dissolution of IPC.  “There is nothing sweet that we are drawing from the structure except for the sourness that we have always been drawing as women of this province. We are the only structure that becomes the voice of where to cough out. We will prove to the ANC that the women’s league is the only hope in terms of the numbers of women who go to the polls,” she said. Dlamini was expected to deliver a response or implementation of demands within 14 days of receipt.
