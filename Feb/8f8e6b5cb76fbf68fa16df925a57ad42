WE’VE often associated nail polish and manicures with femininity. But according to trends, more of the male counterparts are taking care into the hands. According to Garrett Munce, the author of Self-Care for Men, men wearing nail polish has long been viewed as subversive, and has often been associated with certain music scenes like punk and emo. “Subcultures that generally embraced it all have one thing in common: to rebel against accepted standards,” Garrett said. Since our culture has seen nail polish as feminine and marketed it exclusively to women for decades, these cultures understood that a man wearing nail polish challenged that idea. According to trends, many men from all walks of life have been wearing nail polish lately, which Garrett attributes to the fact that “menicures” don’t require much maintenance. Further trends reveal a lot of men have also been painting their nails or having someone else paint them because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has them choosing to experiment more during global lockdowns.
