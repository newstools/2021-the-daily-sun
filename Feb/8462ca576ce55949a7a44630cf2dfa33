THE trial hearing of a man accused of killing his gogo with a broomstick has been postponed. White Ndlovu (36) from White City outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, briefly appeared before the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court sitting at Graskop on Friday. He was arrested at Lulekani in Limpopo last June while on the run following the alleged incident where he had assaulted gogo Thalitha Hlongo (96) to death with a broomstick. He also injured his sister-in-law who was trying to intervene. The accused had been in custody since then, after abandoning his bail application on charges of murder and assault GBH. Meanwhile, Kevin Ndlovu (23) from Agincourt Village, who is accused of killing his girlfriend Nokulunga Mbatha (22) from KZN, is expected to appear in the same court in May. Ndlovu allegedly killed Mbatha, and then placed her body in a suitcase before burying it in a shallow grave. He was granted R5 000 bail after spending months in custody following the confession of the crime to his family. The decomposed body was found in 2019 after he told his family that he had killed Mbatha after an argument. The body had been buried for three months. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed the matters against the two accused were postponed to 24 May.
