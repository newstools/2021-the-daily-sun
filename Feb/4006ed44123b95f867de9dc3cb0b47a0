UNITED Democratic Movement chief whip Nqabayomzi Kwankwa has told the National Assembly he doesn’t want an apology from eNCA. This comes after eNCA reporter Lindsay Dentlinger’s alleged racist profiling of black MPs for forcing black MPs to wear masks before being interviewed, while the previous MP, who was white, wasn’t asked to wear his mask. Following the video, social media users gunned for the reporter and eNCA, calling for the channel to explain what happened and accusing Dentlinger of double standards. I wanted to give her the benefit of doubt, but she seems consistent in her prejudice ??‍?? #eNCA pic.twitter.com/RM3QIXfWbq
