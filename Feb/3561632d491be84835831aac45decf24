Dear MizzB I’M a 35-year-old woman and have recently started dating a 28-year-old guy. My challenge is that he does not ejaculate, no matter the sex position we do. Our sex life is amazing but he goes on forever until he gets tired or I tell him to stop. Is this normal? Dear Sistas People are different and therefore the experiences that they offer sexually will never be the same. There are guys who suffer from delayed or absent ejaculation, like your boyfriend. The most common causes for these are stress, prolonged use of substances, medication side effects and other illnesses. As much as others may find this amusing and interesting, it can be frustrating for you. It will be beneficial for your partner to seek medical assistance so that he can find out what’s the cause of this.
