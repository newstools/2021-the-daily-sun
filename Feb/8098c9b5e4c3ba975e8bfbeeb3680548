THE Commission of Inquiry into State Capture wants former president Jacob Zuma to be jailed for two years for his failure to respect a court order. The Zondo Commission, chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, in its papers filed to the Constitutional Court on Monday, said Zuma intentionally failed to appear before it as ordered and therefore he must face the music. Zuma failed to appear at the commission on 15 to 19 February in compliance with summons. In January, the Constitutional Court ordered that Zuma must comply with directives and summonses issued by the Zondo Commission and appear to answer to the serious allegations against him. Handing down the order, Justice Chris Jafta had said: “Mr Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma is directed to appear and give evidence before the commission on dates determined by it.” The commission wants the court to set aside normal rules and for the application to heard on an urgent basis. Zondo said the court should order the minister of police and the cops to take the necessary steps to jail Zuma for two years. Zondo wants the court to also order the former president to pay costs.
