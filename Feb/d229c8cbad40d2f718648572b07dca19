AWARD-WINNING actress Moshidi Motshegwa, better known as Malefu on The River, is back on TV. The actress was embroiled in a feud with a fellow actress and a co-executive producer of the show. The feud resulted in her dismissal from the show and she was excluded from season 2 of the 1Magic hit telenovela. Speaking to Daily Sun at the time, she said part of the reason for leaving the show was that one of the show’s executive producers said she was too expensive. “Beside my fallout with a fellow cast member, who I was teaching the ropes as I have been in this for over 25 years, I was told I’m too expensive,” said Moshidi at the time. “My life wasn’t easy on set as there was constant animosity. I just hope people will tell the truth.” This was after she scooped the Mzansi Viewer’s Choice gong for favourite actress and taking the R50 000 prize. Despite an outcry from The River viewers, her character was written out of the show. But the star is back on TV and joining The Estate, the new SABC3 telenovela. She’s also starred in e.tv’s Rhythm City as Naomi and her character became a firm favourite.
