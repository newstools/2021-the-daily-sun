AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has lamented his side’s Nedbank Cup exit. Usutu missed a plethora of chances as they lost 1-0 to Black Leopards in their last 16 round on Saturday. The result put a stop to an impressive eight-match unbeaten run for McCarthy’s man. McCarthy, who made wholesale changes to his team against Lidoda Duvha, insisted that they did not undermine their opponents or take the competition lightly. Even although he was disappointed with the result, McCarthy was happy that he was able to give his fringe players a chance. One of the players to have benefitted from McCarthy’s decision was Siphiwe Tshabalala who finally got some much-needed game time. The former Kaizer Chiefs winger only had seven minutes of league action to his name this season until came on against Leopards. “I don’t think we took the competition lightly,” insisted McCarthy. “We wanted to win, and you could see that from the team we put out. I thought it was a pretty strong team that could have caused a major upset. But unfortunately, a lot of our players were not sharp. This happens when players haven’t really been playing week in and week out, they lack that sharpness. If some of the chances we created fell for sharper players who play every week then it would have been a completely different story.”
