THE Gauteng North High Court has set-aside and declared the arrest of Norma Mngoma unlawful. The judgment was delivered by Judge Cassim Sardiwalla in her absence, yesterday in Tshwane. Norma, the estranged wife of former minister Malusi Gigaba, approached the High Court last year after she was arrested by the Hawks in July for allegedly damaging a luxury car belonging to Gigaba’s friend. It was later revealed that her husband was the one who laid the charges against her. She was charged with malicious damage to property and crimen injuria. Mngoma argued in court that her arrest was a scheme to intimidate and bully her, and get illegal access to her computers and phones. She said before her arrest, the Hawks seized all her devices and later allegedly deleted messages, images and data from them. Sardiwalla granted the application on an urgent basis. He said the arrest was unlawful, and the respondents were ordered to restore all the information that was removed from her devices. The judge said he was satisfied that the evidence demonstrate the Hawks acted with malice in that its actions appeared to have been motivated by an abuse of power by the former minister. “There is no evidence that an investigation was conducted regarding a conspiracy to commit murder on Gigaba, and that they failed to give any evidence to gainsay the applicant’s version,” he said. Mngoma is expected to appear again in the Pretoria Magistrates Court tomorrow on the same charges. After her arrest, she was released on R5 000 bail after spending a night at the Brooklyn Police Station in Tshwane. Attempts to get hold of the NPA were unsuccessful.
