THE undertaker lowered the body into the grave and left with the family, with the grave to be closed by municipal workers – but the digging machine wasn’t there. The body stayed in the open grave for more than four hours. Mourners who came to other services were horrified to see the open grave. A mourner, Vuyi Masia, said they held their funeral service not far from the open grave. “We’re told that dead bodies spread the coronavirus, and we’re worried about that affecting us,” he said. “There are cases of people who go to the funerals only to come back sick. We surely don’t want to end up as statistics.”  Vuyi said they were told previously that mourners don’t have to close the graves themselves as there are digging machines known as TLBs that do so. He said security guards told them the municipal workers who were supposed to close the grave were not there. They continued with their funeral but were not comfortable.  He said their gogo, who died last weekend, was not a Covid-19 case. Another mourner said the pin on the uncovered grave indicated the funeral was conducted at 9.30am. “It has been raining and we’re not sure if the coffin doesn’t take water. This is unacceptable and it shows disrespect to the deceased and his family,” said the mourner. Ekurhuleni municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini said they’re investigating what happened.
