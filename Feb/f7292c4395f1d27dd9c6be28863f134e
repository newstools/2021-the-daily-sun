THE 50-year-old man accused of raping a minor was granted R10 000 bail at the Mhala Magistrates Court on Friday, 19 February. This was on condition that he did not interfere with the witness. The accused was not asked to plead guilty for the rape. He allegedly raped the 10-year-old girl in broad daylight in Welverdiend village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, last December. A week ago, his lawyer Advocate Makhosonke Mashego slammed the police during a lengthy bail application, saying his client had defaulted on his medication after being denied access to it in jail. This was following investigating officer Detective Sergeant Izabell Sibuyi opposing bail, arguing that the accused had raped a vulnerable child whose life could still be in a danger as she stayed with her underage siblings because their mum was working on a farm in Hoedspruit, Limpopo. She said the victim could not fight or defend herself if the accused were to be released. She had added that community members were so outraged by the incident that they handed over a memorandum, also opposing bail.
