HE DIED by the gun and his spirit was collected with a gun. That’s how the family of the man who was shot and killed in Hillbrow, Joburg a few days ago saw it. The bereaved were not avenging their late relative, but were merely collecting the spirit of their loved one to avoid spiritual complications after the burial. The firing of the gun sent shock waves through the area and also made shop owners close their shops early. Though cultural practices are different, what mostly has been seen as a way of collecting the spirit of a dead person was through the use of a tree branch with leaves. According to Hillbrow police, the firing of the gun took place where the man had died a few days ago. The family shot into the sky as part of the ritual to collect the spirit. However, the cops said this practice would get people arrested as it is illegal for anyone to discharge a firearm in a municipal area. Cop spokesman Musa Shihambe told Daily Sun: “Shots were fired, but no one was injured. It is not allowed for people to shoot in public. We will arrest anyone who discharges a firearm in public.” FUNERAL ATTENDEES DISCHARGE WEAPONS IN PUBLIC : OLIVIA STR. BEREA. COJ. GP. pic.twitter.com/DwHojHHRSF
