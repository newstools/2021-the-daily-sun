The police announced on Tuesday that Kwinika had been fired after a disciplinary hearing that found him guilty of serious misconduct. NURSE: ASIFUNI iVACCINE! Spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said Kwinika faced disciplinary action, among other things, relating to an incident which occurred in March 2019. “Police officers responded to a complaint of a public disturbance and found Kwinika with his friends outside a block of flats in Tshwane. “He was abusive towards the police officers and assaulted one of them,” he said.
