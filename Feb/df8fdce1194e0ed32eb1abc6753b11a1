Soul singer Kaylow promises to give Mzansi a lot of songs in 2021. The singer, whose real name is Kelello Segoana, recently released two songs titled 24 Hours and Intombi. Speaking to SunBuzz, Kaylow said he’ll also release four EPs this year, with the first dropping in March. “I’d planned to drop an album this year, but I created a lot of music and didn’t know which songs I’d put in the album. “So I decided to release all the songs and let people listen to the songs they wanted to listen to.” Kaylow said 24 Hours and Intombi are the perfect songs for Valentine’s Day. “Intombi is about being with a woman I’ve always prayed for. It celebrates this woman who I can’t even believe is with me because her love just changes the whole atmosphere. “24 Hours talks about wanting to spend the whole day with one person, spending 24 hours with this one person that gives you an incomparable feeling. When you’re with them it feels like it wouldn’t matter if the world disappeared.” ALSO READ | DINEO BACK TO IMPRESS He said the upcoming EPs won’t just have love songs but a variety of tracks. “Some songs will be about my spiritual journey. I obviously won’t focus a lot on myself because I write music that I want people to relate to. “I think of something I went through, that’s common for people to go through, and I sing about that. There’ll also be gospel and party songs. It will basically be a whole body of Kaylow.” The EPs will also have a few features that Kaylow said will be a surprise. “I feel as if I’ve grown as a musician. There was a time where I wanted to build my brand and just sing alone. “And when you build you become selective about who you want to work with. Now my career is at the next level. I’m ready to feature now. At the moment I can’t share about who I’ll feature, but people will love the features.”
