MUKUNDI Malovhele (21) has realised his dream of building a replica Lamborghini sports car. Mukundi, a pupil at Hanyani Secondary School in Tshipise Tsha Sagole in Venda, Limpopo, told Daily Sun he realised he had talent for designing cars when he was still at school. “I used to draw cars and other things and people admired my drawings,” said Mukundi. The Lamborghini is built mostly from zinc, and he’ll add material to make the interior comfortable for the driver and passenger. “Lamborghini is one of my favourite cars. I’d love to drive it one day,” he said. BENEFITS OF WEARING A G-STRING! The car took five years to finish because he had to focus on his studies. “I didn’t want my car to be exactly like other cars, so I added features of my own. “In my spare time I went around dumping sites looking for materials to help me build my car.”  He said some people thought he was crazy, but that didn’t stop him. Mukundi said that because he wanted to be a car designer, he took science at school. WATCH: SOCCER PLAYERS FLASH THEIR 4-5s! “I did matric last year and I’m waiting for my results,” he said.
