A GROUP of traditional healers, calling themselves M5 Medigroup, claim to have medication for Covid-19. The group made the announcement at a media briefing in Tshwane on Thursday, 4 February. The healers said they were working in collaboration with the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University for scientific testing. Group co-founder Mogale Mogale said treatment could not only be found in research laboratories, and that the solution also lied with traditional healers. Mogale said the results from the concoction, a mixture of herbs, had shown a remarkable recovery time of a day or two, the maximum being three. “We conducted tests through the ever-growing number of patients, nearly 100 so far, who can readily bear testimony to the effectiveness of the medicine,” he said. The university was conducting scientific tests on the medicine. ALSO READ: NURSE
