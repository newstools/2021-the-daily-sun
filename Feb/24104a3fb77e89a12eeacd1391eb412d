AT LEAST 1 204 people were murdered in the Eastern Cape in three months. About 399 people were killed with a knife while a firearm was used to kill 306 between October and December last year. Mthatha policing precincts recorded the highest number of cases at 48, followed by Bethelsdorp with 45 and Lusikisiki with 41. This was heard at the crime statistics announcement for the third quarter of 2020/21 financial year in Cala on Friday. Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said: “Murders in the province increased by 0,5% during the period under review compared to the previous quarter last year, an increase from 1 198 to 1 204,” she said. “We also saw an increase of 22,9% in truck hijacking while sexual assault cases saw an increase of 19,2% and robbery of cash in transit of 14,3 compared to the previous quarter last year.” MEC for Transport, Safety and Liaison Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe said: “The crime statistics reveal that six more people were killed compared to the same period last year. That is a lot became one death is one too many. Putting an end to this needs a collective effort between the police and communities,” she said. “According to the stats, some of the major causes of these murders were arguments. So, one of the best things you can do for yourself in an argument is to walk away as it may save your life,” she added. “Domestic violence, robberies at households and businesses as well as mob justice are also up there. The release of statistics on a quarterly basis has to be hailed as a master stroke by our government. It allows us to analyse crime trends more promptly, build on good ones and deal with disturbing ones more promptly,” said Tikana-Gxothiwe.
