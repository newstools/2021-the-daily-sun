A ZAMBIAN soccer coach accused of sexual assault made a brief appearance in the New Brighton Magistrates Court in Nelson Mandela Bay on Thursday, 25 February. The case against the 51-year-old former Orlando Pirates coach, Milutin Sredojevic, was postponed for a trial from 25 to 26 May at the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court. National Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakani said: “Milutin Sredojevic is accused of sexual assault. The alleged sexual assault was reported in December. He was arrested and released on R10 000 bail. “It’s alleged that on December 7 during the Cosafa Games in Port Elizabeth, a 39-year-old woman was delivering coffee at the Wolfson Stadium when she asked Sredojevic if he would need sugar with his coffee,” he said. “He allegedly said no and said he needed another type of sugar, pointing at her private parts. It is alleged she complained about his conduct and her boss warned Sredojevic not to do it again.” “Later on that day, the lady again went to deliver coffee at same stadium and this time Sredojevic allegedly touched her buttocks,” said Ngcakani.
