SWALLOWS FC have suffered a huge blow ahead of their Nedbank Cup last 16 match against rejuvenated Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Friday (6pm). The Birds will play without key defenders – Wandisile Letlabika, Keegan Ritchie and Thabo Matlaba – due to injury. As if that was not enough, Swallows coach Brandon Truter revealed that he will rest veteran players – Vuyo Mere, Lebogang Mokoena and Ruzaigh Gamildien – to recuperate ahead of their crucial DStv Premiership match against TS Galaxy at Mbombela Stadium on Tuesday. The soft-spoken coach, who is still unbeaten in all competitions this season, made it clear that their priority is to collect much needed three points in the league. Said Truter: “Letlabika is not 100% fit, Keegan is out and Matlaba has a hamstring. There will be changes to the line-up, but that doesn’t mean we are taking the game lightly. We will put the best 11 available for our fixture in Polokwane.” He said their medical staff is working around the clock to ensure all players are ready for the trip to Mpumalanga. “The game that matters is the league and our medical staff are working hard to get the players ready. Look, with players like Vuyo, Cheesy (Mokoena) and Gamildien, we have to look into our next three games after the Nedbank Cup,” added Truter. “We play with older players. We have to manage them and if we play them in Nedbank Cup, we run the risk of not playing them in the league.” The 44-year-old Truter revealed that he might change his last line of defence, where goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni has kept Virgil Vries on the bench with great performances.
