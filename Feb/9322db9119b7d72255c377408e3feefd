UTHONGATHI coach Pitso Dladla is concerned that his players might be carried away by the occasion when they face Orlando Pirates in the Nedbank Cup last-32 fixture. The fixture is scheduled to take place at Orlando Stadium on Saturday at 3pm. Talking to the Media in a virtual press conference on Tuesday, Dlaldla revealed that this week there has been already some changes at training which got him worried. Dladla said: “I’m seeing different energy from the players at training. “They want to play, they are eager to play but they are starting to become individuals rather than team players.” However, he belies it is something that can be fixed before match day as Dlala and his technical team are planning to expose the 2013-14 Nedbank Cup winners. He warned: “We have to monitor this energy and desire because it must not develop into a desire for individual gain. “Yes, we like individual brilliance in a game and we encourage players to try and influence the result and win the game for the team but teamwork remains a priority. I hope that by the time we play on Saturday we have managed to rein it in.” Uthongathi will be playing Pirates for the first time in the club history. Dladla is optimistic that his charges can expose Pirates as much as they are a good team in all the departments. He stated: “Pirates is a good team in all departments but as a team, there should be loopholes. We know upfront they have speed, skilful players, but they also have loop-holes that we are planning to expose.” “We are going to give them the respect they deserve. But I believe football is going to be the winner on the day.” Uthongathi could be without the likes of Philani Shange and former Pirates midfielder Issa Sarr who started training on Tuesday as they just recovered from injuries.
