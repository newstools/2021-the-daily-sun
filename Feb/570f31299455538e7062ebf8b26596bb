A DRUNK driver rammed into traffic police officers’ car. North West traffic department spokesman Alpheus Koonyaditse told Daily Sun that the 32-year-old man was arrested for reckless and drunk driving that took place near Majakaneng settlement along the N4. Koonyaditse said the fully marked traffic vehicle with blue lights flashing, parked near a police van, was visible even in the dead of the night as officers were attending to a fatal accident. “They were in the process of removing the body of a person who had died in an accident,” he said. Koonyaditse said unfortunately, up from Brits direction facing the West towards Rustenburg came a speeding car that missed the officers but rammed into their vehicle. He said angry residents gathered and pounced on the reckless driver.  “The police were quick to rescue him, and he was immediately arrested for recklessness and negligent driving,” he said. Apart from the damaged traffic vehicle, no one was injured. “The suspect will appear in the Brits Magistrates Court soon,” he said. Rod Dicks of the North West traffic department gave thanks to officers who swiftly attended to the scene. “Excellent service, empathy and humanness that was displayed there,” said Dicks.
