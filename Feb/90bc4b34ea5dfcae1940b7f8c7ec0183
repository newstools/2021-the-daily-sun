The South African manufacturer of the renowned underwear brand Playtex and Wonderbra is set to be closing shop. Netwerk24 reported that Hanes has applied for voluntary liquidation. It is reported that the 60-year-old company’s factory has been closed since early January leaving over 700 employees unemployed. The Wonderbra online store has also stopped taking orders in South Africa. A Hanes spokesperson told Netwerk24 that Hanes blamed the weak local economy and the pandemic for making things worse. The business rescue process of their “big client” which is believed to be Edgars, has also played a major role as Edgars and Jet - were sold off last year and the Hanes spokesperson confirmed that Edcon owes it money for stock that has been supplied.
