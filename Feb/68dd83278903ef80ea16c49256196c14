WORKING for a music TV channel has taught singer Anathi “Milly” Mngomane many things about music and the entertainment industry. The hip-hop artist, who works for music TV channel Trace, is now applying what he has learnt so far. Milly from Kwa-Thema, Ekurhuleni, has finished recording his new single Come Duze. But he will only release it alongside a music video in April so it can get TV airplay as artists from abroad do. The 28-year-old told SunBuzz that he still wanted to go far and learn more before venturing solely into music. “I love both working on TV and being a musician, but music was my first love. I want to learn more about it while I’m still on TV,” said Milly.

He then got his breakthrough in 2016 when he won the Slikour On Life Underdog competition and toured across the country performing with him. Milly started taking his music career professionally in 2019 when he released his single Mabhebeza. He went on to release another song Oksalayo last year. He was about to focus on releasing a number of singles when music lovers got familiar with his new hip-hop sound called kwaito trap, or new-age kwaito. “My genre was inspired by old-school kwaito and the late Lebo Mathosa. “My single track Oksalayo was inspired by Lebo’s hit-song Be Free,” said Milly. In 2018 Milly got an internship on MTV Base doing marketing. And last year he moved on to Trace to do programming.
