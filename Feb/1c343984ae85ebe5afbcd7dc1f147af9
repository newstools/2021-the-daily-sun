VOSHO squatter camp residents in Khayelitsha in Cape Town have destroyed the shack belonging to a drug addict. Community leader Funyanwa Sobethwa said residents decided to destroy it after drug addicts left them homeless. “Those idiots were fighting because of drugs. The one they didn’t give drugs to then went back to kill the others while they were busy smoking in one of the shacks,” said Sobethwa. She said more than 30 shacks were destroyed, leaving residents homeless. “They are selfish because as soon as you decide to burn people inside their shack, then you are prepared to kill a lot of people,” she added. She said it was painful to lose everything they had worked hard for because of drugs.  “I wish drug dealers can see the results of their work. If they were not selling drugs, these kids would not be smoking. But they only care about the money they are making. What about us?” asked Sobethwa. Another resident said the fire started during the day. “Even though we were there when the fire started, we couldn’t take anything out because it was a string,” said the resident. He added that drug addicts deserved to live in the bushes. “They belong in the bushes because when they are high, they do horrible things like this.” Another resident Asange Maciko said the worst part was that they were on their own. “Most of us lost our jobs because of the lockdown. We do not have money to buy what we have lost, so we need help,” said Maciko.  She said they had lost their children’s school uniform and stationery. “We heard that the city was not giving out building material anymore. So we have to get money for building material, school uniform and stationery. But how are we supposed to do that without money?” Maciko said they were left to pick up the pieces while the addicts probably built another shack somewhere. “They don’t care about us, and I am sure they have already built a shack somewhere while we still stay at other people’s houses because we do not have money.”
