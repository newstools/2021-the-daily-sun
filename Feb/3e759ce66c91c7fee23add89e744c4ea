THE scourge of poor officiating continues to spoil the quality of the 2020-21 DStv Premiership season. This after the officials missed a clear offside which ended up costing SuperSport United at least a point in their clash against Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Molemela Stadium yesterday. Matsatsantsa A Pitori suffered a 2-1 loss to Phunya Sele Sele and as a result let slip of an opportunity to close the gap on log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. The Tshwane outfit remain five points adrift of their neighbours having suffered their third loss of the season. But Kaitano Tembo’s charges will feel aggrieved as Celtic’s winner, scored by substitute Sera Motebang, should not have stood as Harris Tchilimbou was miles offside before sending in the cross. This was just another error in a season that has seen numerous errors made by officials.Nevertheless, Celtic will not be complaining as they returned to winning ways. John Maduka would have been delighted with his side’s performance which included a goal from debutant Reagan Van der Ross. Celtic came into the clash in indifferent form and with pressure mounting on Maduka following their Nedbank Cup exit. They were thumped 4-0 by Cape Town City and denied the opportunity to go one step further than last season in the Ke Yona Cup where they finished as runners-up. But Maduka will be pleased to be back on the winning trail at the expense of a team that beat them 2-1 in the reverse fixture. Celtic are now in ninth place on the Premiership standings with 17 points from 15 matches. They will be desperate to carry their momentum into their next match against Chippa United at the same venue on Saturday (3 pm). Meanwhile, SuperSport have another tough outing ahead against the in-form Citizens at Lucas Moripe Stadium on the same day at 5pm.
