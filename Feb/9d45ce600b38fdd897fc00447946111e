THE Democratic Alliance shadow minister of Basic Education Baxolile Nodada raised concerns regarding the readiness of the department in reopening schools next week. He said the visit by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Basic Education for oversight to KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Gauteng last week uncovered the dire state of schools in these provinces. Some challenges included water and sanitation problems, shortage of learner transport and inadequate classrooms. Nodada said the department had ample time to deal with these problems, but failed to do so. “The DA found serious concerns during the oversight visits, with the provinces all facing similar problems. Many of the schools do not have proper (or any) access to clean water and sanitation. That this should still be a concern in 2021 is simply shocking. The world is suffering at the hands of a pandemic, of which the main defence against is cleanliness. And, the learners and personnel do not even have access to a basic human right that is also their first line of defence against Covid-19. This is beyond shameful,” said Nodada. He said they found out that in one province, over 120 000 eligible learners needed transport service. Nodada said this had led to a huge number of students dropping out due to walking “ridiculous distances” to school. “Furthermore, some provinces have over 800 special needs learners that are not assessed nor placed in schools, with their future doomed and some losing their lives without accessing education,” he added. Meanwhile, the EFF called for parents whose children were unable to register to bring their concerns to their offices. “The EFF calls on all parents who are unable to register their children at school, have not received their results or have received ridiculous demands to purchase personal toiletries for them to report this to the EFF on its various social media platforms,” the EFF wrote on its Twitter account.
