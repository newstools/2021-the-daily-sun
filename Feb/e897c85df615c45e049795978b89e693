PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa was pleased to see the progress made at the Tshwane Automative Trading Zone. He visited the site in Silverton yesterday with Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel, Gauteng Premier David Makhura, Tshwane Mayor Randall Williams and Andrea Cavallor of Ford. Ramaphosa said it was great to see the progress that had been made since his last visit in 2019, despite the challenges posed by Covid-19. He said the development zone presented an opportunity to use the country’s competitive advantages to speed up industrialisation. “These advantages include a well-developed automotive industry with advanced manufacturing capabilities, an appropriately skilled workforce and access to growing markets,” he said. He said the country had the potential to develop a network of emerging suppliers, which would help expand and transform the manufacturing base, export capacity, create jobs and develop skills. “Experience from countries such as Malaysia, China and Singapore, which have managed to place their economies on sustainable industrial paths, has demonstrated the potential of special economic zones. In our own experience, special economic zones have proven to be an effective tool both to enhance our productive capacity and crowd in private sector investment.” The president said since it was created in 2014, the special economic zones programme had managed to attract R18,6 billion worth of private investment from 136 companies. He said another 99 companies had expressed interest in making investments worth R48 billion.
