PARENTS and pupils at Reatlegile Primary School in Mabopane Block U extension, north of Tshwane, were shocked to find school gates locked yesterday. But the parents said they received no communication from the school about its closure. They said they had a stand-off with the principal on Monday after the school failed to supply a bus for pupils who have to travel on a dangerous road. They claimed in December, the principal told them there would be a bus to transport pupils from February. SGB chairwoman Ester Ntuli (43) said they were disappointed when the bus didn’t fetch the children on Monday. “We went to the school to find out what happened, but the principal couldn’t give us the right answer,” she told Daily Sun. “We told him to go to the district office and fix the problem. We told him not to come to school until we have a bus.” Ntuli said they excepted teachers to be at school. But when they arrived, they were told the principal told teachers to join him at the district office. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona was not aware of the school dilemma and they will investigate the matter. He said they can recommit that the said school is due to receive scholar transport. Unfortunately, because of an increased number of pupils who require such service, they were administratively delayed. “However, we are confident that transport will be available in the next two weeks. We wish to plead with the community not to resort to disruption of schooling.”
