FORMER
president Jacob Zuma will not appear before the Zondo Commission on Monday. His lawyer
Eric Mabuza wrote a letter informing the chairman of the commission, deputy chief
justice Raymond Zondo, that Zuma is not coming. He said the
commission was aware of the review application by his client to set aside the
refusal by Zondo to recuse himself from hearing matters raised against Zuma was
still before the court. "The
summons issued for our client to appear on 15 to 19 February 2021 is irregular
and not in line with the Fourth Order of the Constitutional Court judgment of
28 January 2021," said Mabuza. He said
appearing before the commission will undermine and invalidate the review
application. "We
also on record that the review application was not before the Constitutional
Court, and, accordingly, was not considered, determined and or adjudicated by
the court," he said. He said
Zuma's decision not to appear before the commission should not be seen as
defiance. The
Constitutional Court ordered that Zuma must comply with directives and
summonses issued by the State Capture Commission and appear to answer the
serious allegations against him. Handing
down the order, Justice Chris Jafta said: “Mr. Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma is
directed to appear and give evidence before the commission on dates determined
by it.”
