SANGOMA Thembinkosi Mdingi says his six tortoises help him fight evil spirits and heal the sick. The 51-year-old from Philippi, Cape Town, told Daily Sun: “When they die, I dry them up and cut them into small pieces with a grater to make strong muthi for my clients. “I don’t kill them to make muthi, they have to die on their own. I had eight of them but two died in the past two years.” ALSO READ:MY MKHUKHU HAS EYES IN THE SKY Thembinkosi said a lot of people came to his house with different spirits and the tortoises protected him from evil ones. He said he also used his reptiles to communicate with his ancestors. “I talk to my ancestors through these tortoises. They don’t speak but I can interpret their actions and understand what the ancestors are saying to me,” he said. Thembinkosi said the oldest tortoise was 10 years old, followed by an eight-year-old one. “I had two tortoises at first. “I got them from the bushes in the Eastern Cape but they have been having babies,” he said. Thembinkosi said he fed them vegetables, especially green leaves and cabbage, and ensured they had water all the time. He condemned people who killed tortoises. “These are precious creatures and killing them is cruel. When it comes to mine, I protect them and they protect me,” he said.
