SEGWAELANE Village became a no-go area on Thursday, 11 February, after two people were burnt to death by a mob. Entrance and exit points into the village, near Brits in the North West, were barricaded with rocks and burning tyres. A man was burnt to death after he and three others were found hiding in a house. Two others fled from the angry mob. A video sent to Daily Sun shows the man lying on the ground with severe burn wounds. A man then pours what appears to be paraffin on him before he’s engulfed by flames. Bystanders said the man was believed to be a thief and when he was asked what he was doing in the house, he became arrogant. He was beaten and set alight. Just two days later, the residents stopped a Toyota Quantum with seven people inside. They found them in possession of guns and ammunition. Four men managed to escape while the other two were severely beaten and a third was thrown into the burning taxi where he died. A witness to both incidents said the residents were gatvol. “Criminal activity is rife. An old lady was killed by someone who broke into her house a few days ago. No one is safe and we need to protect ourselves,” he said. Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said no arrests have been made. He urged people to stop taking the law into their own hands. Cases of murder, malicious damage to property and assault were opened. “The motive of the incidents is not yet known, although unconfirmed reports suggest the victims were accused of recent incidents of house robbery and break-ins. Early investigations revealed all the victims were from Bekkersdal in Gauteng,” he said.
