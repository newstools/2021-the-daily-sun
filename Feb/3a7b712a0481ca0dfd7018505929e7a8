RANGERS midfielder Bongani Zungu will have to be more of
a professional player and not a celebrity.  Zungu faces a bleak future, facing exclusion from the next
camp as he is currently not active at his Scottish team.  This is after he was dropped from Steven Gerrard’s team for
breaking the Covid-19 rules in Scotland when he attended a house party with
five other players and has since gone into isolation.  This could see him miss out on the Africa Cup of Nations
qualifier match against Ghana next month.  Gerrard has expressed great disappointment in Zungu,
hinting the 27-year-old may have blown his chances of securing a permanent deal
with Rangers when his loan deal expires.  Bafana coach Ntseki has also broken his silence on the
matter.  “These are the same challenge that we have. That is why I
was saying our players must learn to be professional and not celebrities,” said
Ntseki.  “If you become a celeb, you end up not practising professionalism
in your career. Yes, the coach is disappointed with what happened, especially from
a senior player like Bongani.”  Ntseki would not say whether or Zungu will be considered
for Bafana selection, wary not to jump the gun.  He explained: “As soon as we’ve gathered all the information, we’d be able to
speak to the player and then consider what should happen to Bongani in terms of
the punishment he is going to get from his club for breaking the Covid
regulations. I had a meeting with the Safa CEO on the matter. We will take it
from there. It is important to have that information before going into the
selection and the announcement of the Bafana team issues.”
