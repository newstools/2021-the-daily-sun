ORLANDO Pirates are fresh from a third Soweto derby win over rivals Kaizer Chiefs this season and spirits are high. It’s evident that Pirates players are enjoying themselves on the field of play but they seem to be doing the same off it. Their camaraderie has been witnessed by supporters. Bucs midfielder Thabang Monare recently shared a light hearted joke at the expense of his teammate Ben Motshwari that left supporters in stitches. The former Bidvest Wits star shared the video on social media. In the video, Monare jokes about how the coach called him to the side and gave him some instructions in English. And when he returns to the pitch, his midfield partner Motshwari asked him what the coach had said. Monare replied “don’t worry about, it needs one to have matric. Let’s just play football.” Watch the videos below:  Poor Ben ???? pic.twitter.com/cYuHz7F9kR Poor Ben ???? pic.twitter.com/cYuHz7F9kR
