CHAOS erupted and shots were fired as police clashed with residents in Ackerville, Witbank, Mpumalanga on Saturday, 20 February. It is alleged that the cops came to disperse a group of people who had been chilling and boozing past curfew hours. But they were met with resistance and forced to retreat as they were outnumbered by the angry mob, who didn’t want the cops to stop their vibe. It is alleged that one of the cops was manhandled, which led to the men in blue retreating and calling for back-up. Some of the incidences were caught on video, and are now doing the rounds on social media. In one of the videos, a police officer can be seen heading to the van, but he is followed by a man who is zigzagging with a bottle in his hand. With his other hand, he is trying to pull the officer, who is getting away from him. The officer hit him with the back of his gun and he fell flat on the ground. It wasn’t long after that shots, which were allegedly warning shots, were fired. This was an attempt to scare off the mob that was baying for the blood of the “party-pooping” cops. The words “mshaye, mshaye, akashawe” can be heard as the angry mob charges towards the police van. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “A police officer who engaged with the community was pulled around by his clothes and vulgar words were used against him for doing his job. Some police vehicles were also pelted with bottles at the same event.” ________________________________________
