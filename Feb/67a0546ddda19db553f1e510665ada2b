THE rape charges against mega stars DJs Fresh and Euphonik have been dropped by the National Prosecuting Authority. This after the duo was accused of raping a woman at a party several years ago. The woman alleged that on the night in question, she slept and woke up to realise she had been sexually assaulted. The incident allegedly happened at a party in Pretoria. She claimed she found the two DJs still in the room.  Since the rape allegations, both DJs released a statement, saying they would not make any public appearances until the matter was resolved. Primedia, which owns 94.7 and where both DJs were employed, recently released a statement announcing they were being released from their contracts. In a recent turn of events, the NPA announced that the case was dismissed due to lack of evidence. Gauteng North NPA spokeswoman Lumka Mahanjana said: “With regards to DJs Fresh and Euphonik’s matter, the docket was indeed presented to the prosecutor. “Upon perusal of all available evidence in the docket, a decision was taken. There are no prospects of successful prosecution on the available evidence because the evidence is insufficient.” The DJs released a joint statement emphasising their innocence. “We are pleased to state that after considering all the evidence collected while investigating the claim made against us, the chief prosecutor has dismissed the allegations on the basis that the allegations are without merit. The docket has been marked nolle prosequi,” read part of the statement. “As we’ve said before, these allegations are false and we are deeply saddened that gender-based violence, a serious crisis in South Africa, was weaponised in this manner. A huge thank you to all our family, friends, supporters and our legal team.” Euphonik and Fresh had not responded to Daily Sun’s calls and texts at the time of going to print.
