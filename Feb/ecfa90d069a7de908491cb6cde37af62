COMMUNITY Safety MEC Gabisile Shabalala has warned Community Policing Forum members to stop acting like the police. She made the warning while handing over working equipment to CPF members in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, on Friday. Shabalala said CPF members should stop threatening to arrest people and work with cops. “You’re not the police. I want you to get that very clear. You’re not the police because we know that our police are trained in a very specific way and understand what to do. “You’re going to receive workshops on how to deal with information and dealing with the police, who’re responsible for you. We want you to respect the people you’re meant to work with.” She was shocked by how some CPF members behaved in police stations. She said it was important for them to know their role as a support system. “We need to find a way to get them their own offices, mobile or not. They don’t have to be at the charge office,” she said. “They’re going to work under the police and follow instructions. They are going to respect those police stations and help us in a manner that they have been trained in.” She said training and workshops will be conducted.
