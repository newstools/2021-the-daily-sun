Every supporter will tell you their club is the best! But when it comes to popularity, only a few can compete with Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs. The Glamour Boys might not be having the best of times on the pitch at the moment, but they remain the darling of millions of supporters. They are the biggest sporting brand, one of the most supported clubs in the country, with an average attendance of 14,873 at home for the 2018-19 season, before the Covid-19 outbreak. The figure was the highest in the league in that season. Their popularity transcends the borders with a support base of over 16,000,000 fans across sub-Saharan Africa. They are massive on social media, boasting 2 million followers on their official Twitter page. Not far behind the Glamour Boys, in terms of popularity are Mamelodi Sundowns. Masandawana have grown in popularity over the past few years, thanks to their domestic and continental success. They claimed “La Decima” as well as back-to-back trebles. They have become the most successful club in Mzansi in recent years but aren’t quite yet the most popular. Kabo Yellow, as their fans are affectionately known, were beginning to slowly fill stadiums before the pandemic. They have over 800K followers on their official Twitter page. And then there is Orlando Pirates, one of the oldest clubs in the PSL founded in 1937. Pirates drew an average home attendance of 14,533 in the 2016-17 domestic league season. It became the second-highest in the league at that time. They have the second biggest following on social media with 1,6 million followers on their official Twitter page. Below the big three lurks Bloemfontein Celtic. Celtic have a lot of fans in the Free State and their supporters are known as Siwelele. They are never shy to make their voices heard and they are famous for following their team everywhere they play. The green and white army sing from the first till the last minute.
