FORMER portfolio committee on public enterprises chairwoman Zukiswa Rantho has denied that ANC MPs started seriously investigating the Guptas when it became clear Jacob Zuma would not be president for long. Testifying at the Zondo Commission yesterday, she said: “That did not influence us as a committee because we were not working as an ANC group. We were working together with opposition parties. It had much to do with the fact that we wanted to show the world we were in serious motion in dealing with corruption. “If we can’t do it with the kind of evidence in front of us, then that means we will never have to probe anyone.” But Rantho admitted that some ANC members didn’t want parliament to probe wrongdoings at the SABC and Eskom, because they feared party members would get into trouble and it would divide the party. She said former chief whip Jackson Mthembu supported her committee and urged them to continue with the inquiry. “It was a great risk that we had taken. I personally had pressure but I had great support from ordinary South Africans,” said Rantho. She said her son was, on one occasion, confronted by an unknown man who told him his mother was making people’s lives uncomfortable. She said her husband was also followed. When asked why her committee didn’t follow up on a statement made by DA MP Natsaha Mazzone in 2016 about the Gupta’s influence, Rantho said Mazzone might not have followed the right procedures. Mazzone wanted parliament to investigate allegations made in the media that the Guptas were influencing the appointment of ministers.
