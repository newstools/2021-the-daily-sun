Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick as Arsenal saw off a Leeds rally for a thrilling 4-2 win at the Emirates on Sunday. Aubameyang had not started a game for nearly a month after having to quarantine after visiting his mother, who is suffering from illness abroad. The Arsenal captain had scored just five league goals all season in a frustrating campaign for the Gunners, but he took full advantage of Leeds' expansive style to score his first Premier League hat-trick. Aubameyang opened the floodgates with a fine low finish on 13 minutes that wrong-footed Ilan Meslier at his near post on a day to forget for the young French goalkeeper.  Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said it was good to have skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang back in the starting lineup after the Gabon striker's hat-trick in a 4-2 win over Leeds United in the Premier League on Sunday. Aubameyang, making his first start in six games after taking time to be with his ill mother, scored twice before halftime and again just after the break to put his side 4-0 ahead. "We have been missing his goals and him at his best," Arteta, whose side bounced back from consecutive league defeats, said. "He has been training after a difficult period with a family issue and we had a feeling he could be key in this game. "He set the tone for the team up top." Aubameyang was hobbling near the end but Arteta said he hoped he would be okay for next week's Europa League last-32, first leg clash against Benfica in Rome. "He was in pain and got a big kick, twisted his ankle but hopefully he will be fine (for Thursday)."
