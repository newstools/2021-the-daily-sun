JAZZ legend and opera singer Sibongile Khumalo was buried on Saturday, 6 February. The music icon died on 28 January from stroke-related complications. Her intimate funeral service was held at the Joburg Market Theatre. It started with a traditional ceremony before the casket was ushered into the venue. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mkhulu Mtimande said Sibongile was a sangoma. “That’s how a sangoma is buried. “Traditionally, we believe the spirit only leaves the body after 14 days and the process is done so that when her spirit leaves her body, it departs peacefully,” said Mtimande. Sibongile’s brother, Lindumuzi Mngoma, said she had been unwell for quite some time. “She was driven around by her daughter for almost four years because she had a mild stroke,” he said. “She suffered another stroke at the beginning of last year, which landed her in hospital. She recovered from it, but only close family members could see her and knew about this.” He said her last days were extremely hard for the family as she was not able to communicate. “We hope her friends and relatives who were not able to see her will understand and pardon us for not making her condition public,” he said. Sibongile’s eldest son, Tshepo Mngoma, thanked her for always being supportive. “Thank you for the unconditional love you have shown me, my wife and children. Most importantly, thank you for your teachings and advice,” he said. Jazz singer Gloria Bosman said Sibongile’s death left her numb, while actress and musician Abigail Kubeka said she was devastated. Singer Sipho “Hotstix” Mabuse said a big void was left in the country.
