FARMERS sometimes give their bulls vasectomies to make them infertile, but no one expects humans to do this to each other. According to Pastor Bongani Manyisa, that’s exactly what the church did to them. He was giving testimony at the CRL Commission on Friday about the abuse pastors endured at Universal Church. “The church decided on our behalf. They booked appointments for us in Pretoria.” Manyisa said he didn’t have kids when he joined the church at the age of 22. “I left because of the horrible thing it did to us.” He said there was racism at the church and they were mistreated as black and South African pastors. Manyisa said they were not allowed to use smart phones and were deprived of education. “We were only allowed to read what was church related. We had no privacy. Someone would just barge in while you are asleep at your place and search for phones and laptops.” The pastors told the commission the church didn’t want them to mix with the outside world. Pastor Amos Ngququ said they never attended family gatherings, even funerals. Ngququ had wanted a child when he joined but can’t have any now. He left. The church used to choose who the pastors marry. You’d be told here’s the person you’ll marry next week or in two weeks time.” Ngququ said their mandate was to make money for the church. “We were told to shear the wool until the skin shows, or they would say, ‘don’t leave them until they bleed’.” He was ashamed of everything he did to his fellow South Africans. Commission chairman Prof David Mosoma said they’d give the church a chance to reply. Daily Sun tried to reach the church with no success.
