FAF du Plessis has called time on his Test cricket career. The former Proteas skipper, who played 69 matches, has announced his decision with immediate effect. The 36-year-old steps away from the white-ball, following a career that spanned over eight years. But he will remain available for selection in the limited-overs cricket. My heart is clear, and the time is right to walk into a new chapter. It has been an honour to play for my country in all the formats of the game, but the time has come for me to retire from Test cricket,” said Du Plessis. “If someone had told me 15 years ago, that I would play 69 Test matches for South Africa and captain the side, I wouldn’t have believed them. I stand in a place of utmost gratitude for a career full of blessings bestowed on me. Every high and low has shaped me into the man I am proud to stand as today. In all things, those instances worked towards the good of who I believe I am today.” “The next two years are ICC T20 World cup years. Because of this, my focus is shifting to this format and I want to play as much of it as possible around the world so that I can be the best player I can be. "I strongly believe that I have a lot to offer to the Proteas in this format. This does not mean that ODI cricket is no longer in the plans, I’m just making T20 cricket the priority in the short-term. “I will be in conversation with CSA over the next couple of months on what the future might look like for me over the next year to find a solution that works for both of us.”
