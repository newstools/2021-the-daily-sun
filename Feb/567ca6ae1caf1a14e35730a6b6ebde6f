WE all know the reasons South Africans turn to mob justice. While we understand the country is faced with the Covid-19 pandemic, the silence from authorities and our leaders is deafening. The best cops can do is advise residents not to take the law into their own hands. In recent days, mobs have attacked and killed perceived criminals in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West. In all these incidents, people died in the most horrendous ways. Again, the silence was deafening. Yes, mob justice is an act of criminality, but it’s also a desperate cry for help from residents who can no longer tolerate rampant crime in their communities. It’s a plea for local police to be in touch with the people they serve, and know what’s happening in their areas before such acts take place. It’s a cry to take every case seriously, instead of cops turning the public away because the case is minor. It’s a howl for suspects to not be let out within days, only to end up a smouldering pile of ashes in the street or committing more crime. All this adds to the frustrations of residents, who turn to mob justice. It won’t change until there’s no need for communities to take the law into their own hands. – Deputy Editor
