THE one million AstraZeneca vaccines that were bought by South Africa have been sold. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize told the National Assembly the doses that were found to have limited efficacy against the variant dominant in Mzansi have been sold to the African Union. Mkhize said: “The stock has been sold to the African Union. I can confirm that we are selling the doses (not donating). Therefore, there’s no wasteful or fruitless expenditure. We have learnt from the AU that these will be distributed to about 20 countries on the continent.” He said the countries will be in a position to begin protecting their frontline healthcare workers. “This is a win-win situation. We have further proposed that Johnson and Johnson be preferentially deployed to the southern regions of Africa so we can rapidly deal with the variant that is predominating in South Africa and some parts of SADC,” said Mkhize.
