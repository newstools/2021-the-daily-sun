MAMELODI Sundowns striker Gift Motupa expressed his delight on his return to Premiership action following a long injury lay-off. The 26-year-old former Orlando Pirates striker made his debut for Downs, after his switch from Bidvest Wits, in the 2-0 victory over Chippa United as a second-half substitute. He now hopes to be able to continue his recovery on the pitch for the table-topping Brazilians. Speaking to the club's website, Motupa said: "To be honest it was not an easy thing for me to be out and not play for a long time. I kept on pushing myself in order for me to be ready for the right time when I am called upon by the technical team. "I was happy to be back on the field when I came on in the game against Chippa United, it was great to be back on the field of play and I enjoyed that after being out for long due to the injury." Sundowns are in the race for the league, Nedbank Cup and CAF Champions League, with Motupa adding: "I want to help the team win the league, also the Champions League.
