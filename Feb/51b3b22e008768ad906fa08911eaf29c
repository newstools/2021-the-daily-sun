CAPE Town City are preparing for a very busy and potentially gruelling six days where they will play three important matches. The Citizens’ coach, Jan Olde Riekerink, insisted they will place equal importance on all their matches during this period. The Mother City outfit will face Chippa United twice during this period, in the last-16 of the Nedbank Cup and then in the league a few days later. They will then conclude their hectic week with a clash against Stellenbosch FC in what will be a tough Cape Town derby. Riekerink said that all three matches are important in the context of their season, and they go out to win them. The Dutch mentor, though, wants his side to focus on each match as it comes, starting with their trip to Port Elizabeth for a clash with the dangerous Chilli Boys. The encounter has been scheduled to take place at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday (6pm). “We will face a very special five or six days,” said Riekerink. “We will visit Chippa for the Nedbank Cup and then we will have to face them again in the league before we take on Stellenbosch. “We don’t have any priority to say we have to win this one. We can draw that one and lose that one. We have to win all of them. All of the competitions we are involved in are equally important. “We play the Nedbank Cup to win it, not just to compete and get knocked out after a few games.” Riekerink is expecting Chippa to be a tough customer, having shown huge signs of improvement under Dan “Dance” Malesela. Malesela has made the Chilli Boys hard to beat since he rejoined the team. The former TS Galaxy mentor will also be determined to win the Ke Yona Cup for the second time, having done so with Galaxy in 2019.
