AFTER being told she could never have children as her womb was too small, Sibusisiwe Jili is expecting her second miracle baby. The actress, who plays the role of Georgina on Mzansi Magic’s The Queen, told Daily Sun she was very excited. “As excited as I am, I was very shocked when I found out I was pregnant. This wasn’t planned,” she said. “I wanted to have another baby when I turned 35, but I quickly accepted this as part of God’s plan.” The 33-year-old said she didn’t let it break her when she was told she wouldn’t be able to have children. “I said a prayer and luckily God heard me and quickly answered me,” she said. “I proved all the theories wrong and gave birth to Onke. Although he was premature, he’s living proof of my beliefs and recently turned five.” Sibusisiwe said she’s eight months pregnant. “I could pop at any time. My partner and I are excited and can’t wait to hold our baby,” she said. “My pregnancy has been amazing. It’s been much smoother than my first one. There’s more support and more people involved. “With Onke, I was scared all the time because he was born early. I had to constantly check whether he was growing and breathing.” Sibusisiwe, who’s also a musician, said her fans could expect more music from her this year. “I’ve been working on new music. I was in the recording studio this week, but because of the pregnancy I don’t want to put too much strain on myself,” she said. “I’m taking it one step at a time, but people can definitely expect a lot of hits from me this year.”
