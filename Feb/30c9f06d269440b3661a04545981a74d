NO
one will arrest Zuma! This was a statement made by the uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans (MKMVA) President, Kebby Maphatsoe on Thursday night. He was addressing the media outside the homestead of former President Jacob Zuma in Nkandla, northern KZN. The address happened after they met with Zuma. They started just after 1 pm and they only finished after 8 pm. Maphatsoe revealed that in the next few days, MKMVA cadres will camp outside Zuma's homestead. "We will wait and see as we have said before that he is going nowhere. He will stay here and we will wait and see," said Maphatsoe. He said people needed to remember that Zuma is loved by the masses and they as the MKMVA don't think those masses will allow him to be sent to jail. "We are with him. Whatever happens, we will be with him. We are not going to carry President Jacob Zuma on our shoulders and take him to prison, that will never happen. Some hate Jacob Zuma but many people love him and I don't think they will allow him to go to prison," said Maphatsoe. He emphasized that the masses are outraged by how Zuma is being treated by the Zondo Commission. "Masses outside there are very angry. Those who are happy are those that hate him and they are very few. The majority of people are beginning to understand that this commission was specifically created for Jacob Zuma so he's already guilty, whether he goes there or doesn't go there," said Maphatsoe. He said they have seen that Zuma's constitutional rights were trampled upon merely because he requested deputy justice Raymond Zondo to recuse himself. "The constitutional court goes beyond. It says he does not have a right to keep quiet, he must speak so his constitutional rights are taken away," said Maphatsoe. He added that the long meeting that they had with Zuma was fruitful and they were happy with it as they also gained more political education from Zuma.
