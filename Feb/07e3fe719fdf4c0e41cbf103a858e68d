On Thursday Masutha led TTM into the last-16 of the Nedbank Cup beating SuperSport United 1-0 at Thohoyandou Stadium.

Talking to SunSport the former Black Leopards said: “Obviously things have changed at the club, people who are there now are not the ones that employed me. “I am holding no grudges after the club was sold something like this was bound to happen.” SunSport has further learnt that former Baroka and Leopards coach Dylan Kerr is expected to take over the club. Kerr was present at the match on Thursday when TTM knock out Matsatsantsa A Pitori of the Nedbank Cup. Morgan Mammila who is former Baroka CEO is also expected to join Vhadau Vha Damani management.
