THE men who found two skulls and other bones in new graves while digging at Thulamahashe Cemetery on Saturday, 20 February are demanding payment from the Bushbuckridge Municipality for trauma. But the municipality has refused to pay them. Gravediggers Isaiah Hlatshwayo, Eugene Ngomane, Fernando Macamo, Mandla Ngobeni, Sabelo Mathebula, Thato Mashaba, Kind Mathebula, Errol Dzimba, Nghamula Khoza and Sabelo Mathebula claimed they were suffering from post-traumatic stress after digging human remains from new graves allocated by the municipality.  They have, since Monday, demanded at least R500 000 for the ordeal. The incident has led to them shutting down the municipality regional offices. “We are suffering from post-traumatic stress after seeing and holding the bones and tombstone pieces. This is painful as we can’t sleep because we are haunted by what we saw. The municipality must pay us for the suffering so we can consult powerful healers or prophets for ritual so that we are not followed by bad luck,” said Mathebula, one of the diggers. Bushbuckridge Municipality spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said: “We want to make it clear that they will get no financial compensation from the municipality. We are currently in the process of burying the remains that were exhumed. We will also check on the map whose graves those were, and mark them. There was an alternative ground for the bereaved families to bury their beloved deceased.” Traditional healer Dr Annuary Ndlovu warned the diggers that bad luck might follow them if they were not cleansed. “Bad luck might follow them for disturbing the dead. Some families do certain rituals during burial, for different reasons, which is equally so when exhuming for reburial. Their futures could be bleak as they might not find any job, women or even have luck in money for their entire lives if they are not cleansed,” said Ndlovu.
