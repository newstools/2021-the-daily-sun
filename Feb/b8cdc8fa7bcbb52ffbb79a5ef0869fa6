TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) ended a 10 match losing streak when they defeated Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday evening. Thabo Mnyamane's set piece in the last minute of the first half proved to be enough to earn TTM their second win in the DStv Premiership. The victory saw Vhadau Vha Damani climb out of the relegation zone - moving 14th place on the league standings, while the Team of Choice slipped down to the 15th spot.The Team of Choice got off to a bright start with Thabiso Kutumela and Judas Moseamedi combining well upfront in the early proceedings.Moseamedi flicked the ball on for Kutumela, whose well-taken shot was brilliantly finger-tip over the crossbar by Tshakhuma goalkeeper Washington Arubi in the seventh minute. Moseamedi was a constant threat to Vhadau Vha Damani defence with his sharp movement and runs in the opposition's half.Bandile Shandu was sent through on goal by a defence-splitting pass from Moseamedi six minutes before the half-hour mark, but the midfielder fired straight at Arubi.Maritzburg kept pushing for the opening goal and Kutumela's effort hit the crossbar in the 42nd minute with former Zimbabwe international Arubi well-beaten.The hosts were left to rue their missed chances as Mnyamane scored on the stroke of halftime with a well-taken free-kick to make 1-0 heading to the break. Maritzburg coach Ernst Middendorp made four changes prior to the start of the second-half as he introduced Sibusiso Hlubi, Ali Jose Meza, Riyaaz Ismail and Phiwayinkosi Zuma.The Team of Choice applied some pressure on Vhadau Vha Damani and Clayton Daniels headed the ball just over the crossbar after connecting with Keagan Buchanan's corner-kick in the 56th minute.The hosts kept pushing for the equalising goal and Daniels thought he had level matters when he netted with 20 minutes left, but the goal was disallowed for a foul.Kutumela's through pass found Hlubi, who somehow placed his shot over the crossbar from point-blank range in the 78th minute and Tshakhuma survived a late scare.The visitors then stood firm at the back having introduced defender Lebohang Mabotja and ultimately, Tshakhuma emerged 1-0 winners over Maritzburg on the night.
