ORLANDO Pirates hammered Jwaneng Galaxy 3-0 in the Caf Confederation Cup match played at Botswana National Stadium yesterday. Pirates broke the deadlock via veteran defender Thulani Hlatshwayo’s great header in the 32nd minute to have a cushion going into the halftime break. The Soweto giants continued to dominate the home side after the break and stocky wingback Paseka Mako was unlucky not to break the ice in the 54th minute when he shot wide after being set up by Linda Mntambo. Mntambo made it 2-0 with a powerful low shot that went past bemused Jwaneng defenders into the back of net following a great pass from Mako. Bucs substitute, Jean-Marc Mundele put matters beyond Galaxy’s reach through an incredible volley giving Jwaneng keeper no chance to take a three- goal advantage ahead of the second leg scheduled for Orlando Stadium.
