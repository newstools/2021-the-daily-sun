MY NEIGHBOUR almost killed my child! This was according to a father who said his neighbour poured boiling water on his 12-year-old daughter’s neck. The dad from Lusaka in Mamelodi, Tshwane, said the incident happened on Saturday, 6 February. “My child went to my neighbour’s house to play and the kids started throwing rocks at her. She came home to fetch a knife without my knowledge, and went back to threaten them with it,” he said. “Their father took the knife from her and when she demanded it back, he poured her with boiling.” The father, who cannot be named to protect the minor, said he was shocked when he heard his daughter screaming. He then went outside, only to find her with burn wounds to her neck. He took her to Mamelodi Regional Hospital and she was discharged the following day. The dad alleged that his neighbour told him he had been waiting to harm his daughter for a long time, but wouldn’t say why. “I need justice for my daughter and I want the man to rot in jail.” The furious father claimed the neighbour wanted to give him R4 000 to not report the matter to the police. “I earn a living by doing piece jobs, but that doesn’t mean I will let a man, who almost killed my child, avoid justice,” he said. Angry kasi residents wanted the man to be arrested. “We want this man to rot in jail because he fails us as parents,” said a resident. Mamelodi East police spokesman Constable Lethabo Mashiloane said: “A case of assault GBH was opened and a man was arrested and charged. He is expected to appear in court on Wednesday, 10 February.”
