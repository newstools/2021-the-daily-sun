Painter Lebani Sirenje, popularly known as Rasta The Artist, has ruffled feathers once again. The controversial painter took to social media to reveal a portrait he made of the late Mamelodi Sundowns player, Motjeka Madisha. The soccer star died in horrific car accident which left him burnt beyond recognition last month. “KaboYello, Sky is the limit,” he captioned the portrait. It didn’t take long for the fallen soccer star’s fans to react to the painting.

Jay Masombuka commented and said: “Rasta, please stop disrespecting Madisha, please. This is not funny.” In the midst of all the backlash, Rasta also pulled a shocker and revealed he needs donations for paint. “It’s been a very busy year with us losing our loved ones and public figures and as a result, I’ve run out of paint. Please DM for donations,” he said. In a previous interview with Daily Sun Rasta, who always receives backlash, said the negative comments don’t bother him. “Honestly speaking, I’m used to the backlash that I always get. I have accepted that there’ll always be critics in everything that I do and the acceptance led to me not being bothered by them anymore,” he said. “They used to affect me before when I see them saying the person I have painted looks nothing like the person who has passed on, but now I just cut through the noise and do what I do best.” KaboYello, Sky is the limit#RipMotjekaMadisha @Masandawana pic.twitter.com/sPZuHgPzo7
