THEY have been complaining about the bad condition of their road for over 15 years and can’t take it anymore. On top of that, the recent heavy rainfall made the situation even harder for residents of Medingen in Ga-Kgapane, outside Bolobedu in Limpopo. They said the road has big potholes and poses a big risk to their kids’ lives. They also can’t get any services as vehicles can’t reach the village. Residents said they tried to speak to their ward councillors and the Greater Letaba Municipality with no success. “Public transport can’t access our village and some pupils are forced to leave home as early as 5am so they can reach school on time as scholar transport can’t reach pick-up points. “We can’t continue living like we don’t have rights,” said Joe Kgatle (47) “We need the services we were promised when we put this government in power.” Resident Ntebatse Sekgodiso (29) said the bad road affected his transportation business. “I created an app which operates like Uber. So I take commuters wherever they want to go, but the bad road discourages drivers as cars swim in the potholes,” said Ntebatse. Residents want a new road. They said if officials don’t listen to their demands, they will force them to listen. Greater Letaba spokeswoman, Lovers Mainetje, said the road belonged to the provincial roads and infrastructure department, whose spokesman Joel Seabi said they’d investigate.
