COPS at Van Rhyn Deep Pound in Benoni, Ekurhuleni have been accused of corruption. According to insiders, cars are stripped at the pound and then sold. Two victims showed Daily Sun photos of their stripped cars. Nomvula Mabuza (32) from Duduza, Ekurhuleni said her father was hijacked while driving her car. He was killed during the incident. Nomvula’s 2010 Chevrolet Aveo was then taken to Van Rhyn Deep Pound by police as evidence. But when they went to check the car, they found the radio and all four sports rims had been stripped. The engine was tampered with. WATCH: MLUNGU TAKES OF G-STRING AND WEARS IT AS MASK! “I want the SAPS to pay for my stolen rims. I thought my car was protected at the pound, but I was wrong.” Nomvula said when she complained at the pound office, officers told her they were tired of corruption and advised her to take the matter forward. “This was not the first incident at the pound. In 2012, a Fiat Uno was stolen and later found. It was taken to Van Rhyn to be cleared, but they don’t know where the car is to this day,” she said. Another victim, Mendo Ngemntu (46), said he has been fighting for more than five years to get his Toyota Yaris Spirit back from the pound. He said his car was impounded on 6 November, 2015.  “I was selling my car to a car dealer in Benoni to get a deposit to buy a new car.” He said cops had to check whether the car was stolen, which it wasn’t. “I was told the car would be impounded if they find a minor problem with it and I will have to pay to release it. After they checked my car they told me I won’t get it back because it had cuts and joints.” Mendo said he was now struggling to get his car back.  “A cop told me to deregister the car or I won’t get it back. But I refused. I was warned it would make it easy for the cops to sell it if I deregister it,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said Nomvula’s case was being investigated and he urged Mendo to open a case so investigations could start.
