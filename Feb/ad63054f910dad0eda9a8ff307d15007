THANK God it's Friday. That's the spirit in the Orlando Pirates camp at the moment. Or could it be the calm before the storm? Nevertheless, Bucs players are enjoying a quiet day indulging in their favourite meal a few days before a tough Caf Confederations Cup assignemnet. They face Botswane side Jwaneng Galaxy in the second-leg of their play-off at Orlando Stadium on Sunday. It's not often that football players or their clubs allow the outside world into their camp. But Pirates have made an exception, sharing with the world what their favourite meal is on a Friday. ? ?????? - ....?????????? ?????? ???? @romans_pizza?????#PiratesAndRomans#OrlandoPirates#OnceAlways pic.twitter.com/HEJWfETJxY
