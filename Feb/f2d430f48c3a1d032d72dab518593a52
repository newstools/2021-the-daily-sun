KAIZER Chiefs have relieved
Itumeleng Khune off his captaincy duties. Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt
confirmed that defender Ramahlwe Mphahlele is now the team’s captain after his
side lost 2-1 to AmaZulu in a DStv Premiership match at FNB Stadium on
Wednesday. Khune has now conceded 12 league
goals in six matches this season following the loss, courtesy of goals from
Augustine Mulenga and the later winner from Lehlohonolo Majoro. This was Khune’s first game
since conceding two goals against SuperSport United in December. “Ramahlwe is the captain now,”
said Hunt shortly after the Usuthu game. “Khune has been out for a long
time. But Rama is the captain now.” This is not the first time in
his career that Khune has been relieved of leadership duties. He was previously stripped of
the armband by then Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter in the 2014-15 season, replaced
by Tefu Mashamaite as Khune was out with a long-term injury. He also lost the armband to
Siphiwe Tshabalala under ex-chiefs coach Steve Komphela. The decision can be
regarded as a huge fall from grace for Khune, who has battled for form for the
past two seasons now. Since he made his league debut
against Jomo Cosmos on 8 August 2008 in Durban, Khune has conceded 237 goals
and has kept 147 clean sheets in 316 matches.
