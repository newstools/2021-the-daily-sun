Peter Drucker once said: “What gets measured gets managed”. This academic writer was highlighting the importance of quantifying things in order to get them done. In other words, dividing the amount of work into time-frames in order to manage your time. This was the sentiment when the question of who has the biggest 4-5 in the world was asked. Many people might jump to pornography to get the answer. But, according to recent reports, a certain Roberto Esquivel Cabrera is claimed to have the biggest 4-5 in the world. As the famous Guinness World Records seeks to verify this, the 54-year-old Mexican has no doubt brought in the hot spice on social media. Measuring in at 48cm, Roberto’s size was something he worked on since his teenage years. He used to lift weights with his 4-5, with one doctor confirming that he used to bandage his manhood to enlarge his size. Roberto is now registered and categorised as disabled because of his huge penis, that has also become a sight to behold for the female counterparts.
