A trader was gunned down as a gang of unknown criminals fired shots at his truck, riddling it in bullets before it stopped at a crime hot-spot road in Arthurstone outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Thursday. Frightened motorists who saw the drama said they spotted the gang driving in more than four cars, including an Isuzu bakkie, Ford Focus, VW Polo and VW Golf, in a high chase with the truck from New Forest towards Bushbuckridge. “Suddenly, the bakkie full of gang members in the back overtook the truck. They then started shooting at it, and it steered off the road before stopping near a speed hump. The gang quickly alighted from the bakkie, surrounded the truck and continued shooting. They then jumped into the truck and emerged with a bag of money before fleeing the scene,” the motorists said. When police arrived, the truck was still idling with its lights flicking. The driver was leaning towards the steering wheel covered in blood. Paramedics certified him dead at the scene. Saddened trader Amjad Pervaiz (39), also from Thulamahashe, told Daily Sun that he received a call from police that his truck and driver Abdul Gafoor (68) had been hijacked in Arthurstone. “We are really saddened about this brutal murder. Abdul was on his way to deliver potatoes around Bushbuckridge, but he was killed by a gang of robbers who also took an undisclosed amount of cash,” Pervaiz said. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “Police are looking for the suspects who are still at large after fatally wounding a Pakistani national in Arthurstone.” Anyone with information can contact Mhala police on 013 773 0331, Captain Malamba Khosa on 072 624 5133, Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or send information to MySaps App.
