A DRIVER in a bakkie with a City of Ekurhuleni logo smashed his car from behind on Saturday, 13 February. Molefe Rakosa got out of his car to confront the driver, who was apparently drunk. As he was busy talking to him, another drunk driver bumped into Molefe’s blue VW Polo Vivo. When the first driver, who drove a Nissan NP300 bakkie, saw Molefe leave to confront the second one, he fled the scene. But Rakosa managed to get his car’s registration number. He also took the second driver’s car keys to stop him from running away as well. Molefe contacted the City of Ekurhuleni call centre to report he’d been bumped by a municipal official but got a raw deal. “I was made to wait for more than an hour and no one seemed to want to help because a Metro car was involved,” he said. ISIBAYA ACTRESS ARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER! Molefe said community members who saw the incident supported him. “When Metro officers finally came, they arrested the second driver for reckless and drunk driving,” he said. “They shifted their colleagues’ case to the poice for them to open an accident report. “I have the registration number. That man must pay for damaging my car. I’m not going to let this go.” Molefe blamed President Cyril Ramaphosa for allowing liquor outlets to operate. “People are irresponsible on the road and we’re suffering because of such drivers,” he said. Sergeant Harry Manaka confirmed that a drunk and reckless driving case was opened at Duduza Police Station. An accident report was opened for Molefe. Spokesman Kobeli Mokheseng advised Rakosa to go to his local Metro cops offices and ask to see the station commander, who’ll then follow up on his case.
