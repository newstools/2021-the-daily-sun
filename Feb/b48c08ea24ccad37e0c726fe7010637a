Dr Tumi said he was visiting a friend in Midrand. “I was passing by to greet a friend. It’s a car wash and an eatery. You don’t even think anybody could ever pull something at a place like that. And I don’t think I’d have suspected him even if I had seen him beforehand because there are people who are just passing by there,” he said. The singer opened a case at Midrand Police Station and said he hasn’t heard an update from the cops yet. This happened to Dr Tumi yesterday ??‍?? Please be aware guys?? pic.twitter.com/tFMoEDU2oT
