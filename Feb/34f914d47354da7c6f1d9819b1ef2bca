VICTIMS who have been sexually harassed and assaulted by their teacher must come forward. This call was made by the South African Council for Educators (SACE) after Daily Sun published a story on Friday, 12 February about a high school teacher (50) who had previously been found guilty of sexual misconduct by the Gauteng Department of Education but managed to crawl back into teaching and landed a deputy principal position at a different school. He was found guilty of seven counts of sexual misconduct involving pupils in Mohlakeng, west of Joburg, in 2014 and was dismissed and his appeal also failed. In his dismissal document, the teacher was accused of telling pupils they had sexy legs and they looked like they’d be good in bed while he told others he wanted to poke them. In a statement, SACE said the teacher was not blacklisted due to lack of evidence and witnesses. “The matter was brought to SACE’s attention in 2016 and he was investigated in November 2016. At the time, the teacher had been dismissed by the Gauteng Department of Education and his whereabouts could not be established,” said SACE. “The learners had already left the school and they could not be located either as they had left school three years earlier.” SACE said they had no option but to close the file pending further evidence. “SACE would not be in a position to blacklist the teacher in the absence of any evidence and the evidence can only be provided by the witnesses who can’t be located. “SACE is calling upon the victims in the matter to get in touch with SACE offices.” Last week, the department said they were not aware of his appointment and after learning about it, the school has put the teacher on precautionary special leave. Victims are urged to send an email to georgem@sace.org.za.
