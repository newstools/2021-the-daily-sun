MINISTER of Basic Education Angie Motshekga is set to announce the much-awaited matric results on Monday, 22 February. The quality assurance body Umalusi gave the department a nod to release the results on Monday last week. This was despite the leaking of two exam question papers. Maths Paper 2 and Physical Science Paper 2 were leaked two hours before they could be written. The department said the leak didn’t compromise the exams. However, it said candidates found to be guilty of cheating will have to face the consequences after investigations are done. Motshekga said included are individuals working at the matric exam papers printing centres, who’re behind the leaking. On the other hand, Umalusi said those candidates who knew the papers were leaked will have their results blocked. “Those who received the paper passively, that is those who did not know it was leaked, will be exonerated,” said Umalusi. Last year more than one million matrics sat for the exams. The department said although it faced wide-ranging challenges, they are happy Umalusi gave them the green light to release the results. The various MECs from nine provinces will announce their respective results on Tuesday and matrics will access their results through various online platforms or otherwise.
