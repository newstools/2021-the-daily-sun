Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has been looking for ways to curb the country’s rising suicide rate. To do this, he has appointed a minister of loneliness. The minister is tasked with trying to reduce loneliness and social isolation. The prime minister appointed is Tetsushi Sakamoto, who’s already a minister in charge of dealing with Japan’s declining birthrate. Insider.com reports that women are suffering from isolation more than men, and the number of suicides is on the rise. Loneliness has long been an issue in Japan, often discussed alongside “hikikomori,” or people who live in extreme social isolation. During the Covid-19 pandemic last year, with people more socially isolated than ever, Japan saw a rise in suicides for the first time in 11 years. In October, more people died from suicide than had died from Covid-19 in Japan last year. There were 2 153 suicide deaths that month and 1 765 total virus deaths until the end of October 2020, according to the Japanese National Police Agency. After a surge in new cases starting in December, Japan has now recorded 7 506 total coronavirus deaths as of this month. Studies show that loneliness has been linked to a higher risk of health issues such as heart disease, dementia, and eating disorders.
