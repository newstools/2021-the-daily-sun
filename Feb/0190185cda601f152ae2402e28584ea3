Wigs have become a norm for women of colour and many swear by them because of how effortless they are to maintain, unlike natural hair. As much as wigs are loved by black women, it seems the latest short kinky hair wig creation has failed to impress many. The wig was advertised on Facebook with the caption: “No need to cut your hair again, your low hair cut wig is now available” Many seemed unimpressed by how the wigs looked while others suggested that maybe a different texture of hair/fibre be used to improve the look, but there were those who were keen to try out the new look. Some of the critics even compared the texture of the wig to a carpet it was laid on for advertising.  “It doesn’t look different from the carpet you laying stuff on, just saying ??” one commented.
