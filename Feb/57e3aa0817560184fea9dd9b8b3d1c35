BAROKA are not scared of high flying Mamelodi Sundowns. This is the message that Bakgaga coach Matsimela Thoka has given to his players ahead of their Premiership clash with Downs at Loftus Versfeld tomorrow (5pm). The PSL champions are currently top of the log with 33 points from 15 matches. The Brazilians and the PSL newcomers Swallows FC are the only unbeaten teams in the Premiership. And Downs’ form has been impressive this season and many are tipping the club of retaining the title. But Thoka is optimistic that his side can be the first team to beat the 10-times PSL champions. “Everyone knows that Sundowns have quality players,” said Thoka. “But I believe in my boys and I am confident that we can get three points from Downs. The good thing is that when you play a big team like Downs, it’s easy to motive the players. They (players) want to play in this kind of game.” The last time Baroka faced the Brazilians in a league encounter, the Limpopo-based outfit lost 2-0 at Peter Mokaba Stadium. The game took place on the 9 January, with Lyle Lakay and Themba Zwane netting for Downs. “They beat us in the first round because of mistakes we created,” explained Thoka. “But this time I do not see that happening. I’m impressed with the attitude of the team at training. “We are not scared of Sundowns. The thing about our league is that it’s not easy to predict games. Any team can beat any team.” Thoka also revealed that defender Vusi Sibiya is back from a long term injury. “Sibiya has started jogging and his injury has healed. But he will miss this game because we are working on his fitness. I think after the Downs game he will be available. We’re just pleased he is back,” added Thoka.
