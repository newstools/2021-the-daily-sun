AFTER the Maboas lost everything in a shack fire, a Good Samaritan came forward to help. Daily Sun recently published a story about the family from Liberty section in Dennilton, outside Groblersdal in Limpopo, and it touched the heart of Balao Fashion Design founder, Jane Makopole (37). Jane decided to donate blankets and clothes to the family. After reading the story, she knew she had to share the little she had. “This was a symbol of love and my kind heart, which I hope will ease the family’s pain,” she said. “It makes me feel happy when I see a smile on someone’s face. The family’s situation deeply affected me, especially as we’re all going through difficult times. “I was worried about how they’d recover all they lost, especially with Covid-19 and no one being employed. “I decided not to fold my arms and continue blaming government for not doing enough to help people. “The family lost everything, and it’s important for us as residents to comfort them.” Jane said she was taught to share and help others in need. Samuel Maboa (31) was very grateful for the donation. “I’m happy with this donation and it means a lot to me,” he said. Samuel said life had been difficult since the incident. “I’m unemployed and I was stressed because it was not going to be easy for me to recover everything I lost in the fire,” he said. “The majority of the donated clothes were for women, so it would help to get some men’s clothes as well.”
