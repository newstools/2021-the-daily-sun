MARITZBURG United brushed aside GladAfrica Championship leaders Sekhukhune United 2-1 to book their spot in the Nedbank Cup last-16 at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday evening. Second-half goals from Tebogo Tlolane in the 47th minute and Sibusiso Hlubi on the 70th were enough to send the Team of Choice in the next round of the tournament. Maritzburg joins Polokwane City, Mamelodi Sundowns, Cape Town All Stars, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Pretoria Callies in the last-16. Sekhukhune dominated the first half of the match creating couples of chances, but they could not get past German goalkeeper Marcel Engelhardt who was made his debut for Maritzburg. The two sides went to the break without scoring any goals. Maritzburg came into the second half to a perfect start as Tlolane gave them the lead just two minutes from the break with a thumping high strike after a rebound fell on his path inside the box from a long throw-in. Hlubi doubled the league with 20 minutes remaining on the clock. Sibusiso Mbonani gave MacDonald Makhubedu's men hopes of a comeback when he pulled one back in the 90th minute to make it 2-1 for his side. But that was not enough to take the game into the extra time. Tlolane who walked away with the man of the match accolade said they still need to improve. “Honestly speaking it was a tough encounter, the team we played against are number one in their league,” Tlolane said. “First half they dominated us but second half we came back and made a few changes in our games plan, we then managed to get goals. The guys that came on (substitutes) changed the game. “Our first half was bad second half better, and this will boost our confidence the is still a lot of work that needs to be done.” Early on the day, Pretoria Callies defeated Royal AM 1-0 to advance to the next round of the tournament. Callies are in the last-16 of the Ke Yona Cup for the first time in the history of the club.
