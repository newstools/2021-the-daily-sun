HE is determined to build his church on the local sports grounds, and no one will stop him. Pastor Francisco Masenya of Heavenly Kingdom Church in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, told Daily Sun that the sports grounds has been abandoned for years. “I don’t live far from the place and have not seen any children playing there. But community members want to stop the holy project of building a church. I don’t understand why they are angry,” he said. Masenya said that was the best spot for his congregants as most lived in the area. ALSO READ: ZINHLE MABENA’S HUSBAND, ROBERT NGWENYA SPEAKS! Resident Marcus Mathiane (79) said the ground was very old, and they had been using it for many years. “The ground was bushy and we cleared it. I’m not happy that people want to invade it,” he said. Sanco Hammanskraal chairman Job Mabena said the field belonged to the community. ALSO READ: PROSECUTOR BUST FOR SHOPLIFTING! “The community is angry and doesn’t want to lose the sports grounds. We will not stand and watch as these pastors take away our children’s playground. It helps to keep them busy and away from drugs and crime,” he said. Mabena said they would fight for their sports grounds. Kekana Tribal Authority secretary, Stevens Malinga, said they were aware that Masenya wanted to build a church, and would not intervene if he built it next to the field. “I hope he’s not building it on the sports grounds because that will definitely cause problems among our people.”
