SAFTU is leading a protest across the country ahead of the budget speech this
afternoon. Workers say
they want an alternative macroeconomic framework that is geared towards
addressing basic people's needs. The march
is aimed at addressing economic transformation, the strengthening of the public
service, and the renewed efforts to build a capable developmental state. #SAFTUStayAway #SAFTUStrike pic.twitter.com/OpyYFY6lki  KZN Motorcade #SAFTUStayAway #SAFTUStrike pic.twitter.com/TNtYYw7j5b #SAFTUStrike #SAFTUStayAway in JHB...
