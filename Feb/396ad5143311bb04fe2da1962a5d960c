I like him because we’re both clean, and always wear white shirts like Casanovas,” he said. “Even though I always preach peace, many people hate me. They always accuse me of things or put me on trial. But I don’t sleep in prison.” He said Msholozi touched his head and bestowed upon him his blessings to continue with his success in the music industry. “I now feel more powerful, courageous and clever. I’m going far with my music career.” Mthandeni said his enemies don’t sleep and try to dent his name, but his fans keep him strong. “I have many fans who call themselves amabhinca and dress like me. With everything that has happened in my life so far, Id like to appreciate their consistency. Amabhinca know how to give real love,” he said.
