AUTHOR Neo Mabiletsa bares all in his latest book, Does Time Really Heal? The book, that was inspired by his wife’s death, sees the author talking about his feelings and the experiences he went through following her death. Neo, also a motivational speaker and life coach, hails from Meadowlands in Soweto. He told SunBuzz that the book had been a long time coming. It was published in March last year. “I kept on losing people in my life and I didn’t know how to deal with it. When I lost my wife Nonhlanhla, the pain was so unbearable that I needed to tell my story and help others. I’ve noticed that when you lose somebody, people try to comfort you but say the wrong things,” he said.

That’s when I realised that people didn’t know how to comfort others. So I decided to write about it and to teach people how to speak to those who are grieving,” he said. Neo already has two books under his belt, Now I Understand Why It Had To Happen and Chronicles Of The Fatherless Son, published in 2012 and 2019 respectively. “This started as a love for reading. I used to lock myself in a room and read books. “Later on I developed the love for writing. A few years ago, I decided to put everything I went though in a book,” he said. Neo is working on two more books that will be published later this year.
