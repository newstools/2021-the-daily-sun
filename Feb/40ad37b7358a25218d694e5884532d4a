IT IS one thing to explain to the insurance company how you crashed into a Lamborghini Aventador SV. But, itâ€™s a scary thought trying to explain to the Lamborghini owner how you crashed into him. So, a Ford Fiesta driver thought it would be a great idea to make a run for it in the video that has surfaced on social media. The Fiesta can be seen rear-ending the Lamborghini and instantly fleeing the scene. In the video, the Lamborghini can be seen travelling in the left lane with the brakes on and indicating left. Just as the driver slows down to make a turn, the car is rear-ended by a Fiesta that was following close behind. A post shared by FX CARTEL (@sebastiendub)
