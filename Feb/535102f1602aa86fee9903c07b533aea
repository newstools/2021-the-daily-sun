ESKOM will be implementing Stage 2 load shedding from Friday, 12pm midday until Sunday at 11pm. The power utility announced on Friday that load shedding had been worsened by the forced shutdown of five generating units at the Medupi Power Station. According to Eskom, this was a result of the inability to get coal into the units due to the heavy rain in the Lephalale area last night. “The area experienced 65mm of rain, which added to the constraints caused by the heavy rains due to cyclone storm Eloise over the past two weeks.” Eskom had implemented contingency plans and deployed additional resources to deal with the heavy rainfall in the Mpumalanga and Limpopo areas, and the teams were working hard to return as many of these units to service as soon as possible. “We currently have 4 114MW on planned maintenance while another 15 739MW of capacity is unavailable due to unplanned maintenance,” said the utility. Eskom urged the public to reduce electricity usage in order to help minimise load shedding.
