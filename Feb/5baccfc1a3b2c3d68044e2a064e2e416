A point is better than nothing. This is how AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy summed up their DStv Premiership goalless humdrum against Moroka Swallows yesterday. “Under the circumstances, you take what you get,” said McCarthy. “We weren’t our usual self. I don’t think we’ve played the worst game like we did today... and still get a point. We were lethargic, though we created better chances. I’m so sorry for the fans who watched from home because usually we try to entertain.“ But there is a lot to build on. Tactically we got it right. But didn’t play our usual game. A point is better than nothing. My players tried. “We will keep the momentum going into the match against Kaizer Chiefs on Wednesday.“ We can’t play amazing football every day. On Valentine’s Day, the Birds and Usuthu kept to the love theme as they spent the afternoon blowing kisses to each other on a football pitch. A game that promised a lot simply failed to live up to its billing as the two sides played out a goalless humdrum. Ruzaigh Gamaldien was starved of the ball and spent the afternoon frustrated like a motorist stuck on the side of the road on the country road. Kgaogelo Sekgota was lively on the wing while Njabulo Ngcobo kept the Birds defence in shape. But Usuthu weren’t great shakes either as Lehlohonolo Majoro huffed and puffed to nothing of consequence. They were not the team that mesmerised against Bloemfontein Celtic last week and certainly not the McCarthy enterprising bunch, as the latter admitted as much.
