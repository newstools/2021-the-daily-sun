SA CRICKET director of cricket Graeme Smith has called on the ICC to show leadership! This comes after Australia cancelled their tour of Mzansi over Covid-19 concerns. While the pandemic has the sporting world in a fix, Smith feels more should be done to ensure the smaller nations have decent fixtures and not only the big three; Australia, India and England. ‘The relationship is definitely strained at this stage. There is an effort, certainly from our side, to engage and to set up a meeting more at board level now,” said Smith. “More than anything, the ICC needs to have strong leadership going forward. I believe Covid is even amplifying the haves and have-nots and the relationships across the board and how cricket’s future landscape is going to be handled. “The Future Tours Programme is going to be hugely challenging with eight ICC events in the next eight years, an extended IPL and the calendar being dominated by England, Australia and India. "That just amplifies the stress on us and the other countries looking for good content. Their leagues are just getting bigger and bigger and the rest will be left with no content.” The Aussies announced two weeks ago they were pulling out of their tour, despite CSA having reassured them their health concerns were addressed. The Proteas have just returned from Pakistan where they lost a Test as well as a T20 series. They will now host the same Pakistanis in three ODI matches and four T20s in April. “This Pakistan tour coming up was meant to happen last October and we were meant to go to the West Indies last year, there’s also a Sri Lanka tour, India before the World Cup, and they’re also meant to be coming here at the end of the year,” Smith explained. “But it takes time to finalise these things. It’s a bit of a bun fight because every nation is trying to fill gaps.”
