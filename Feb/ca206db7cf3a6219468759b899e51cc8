THE department of COGTA in Mpumalanga is calling for road users to be extremely careful following the collapse of bridges and extensive damage to infrastructure in the province. Several roads have been temporarily closed after some roads were washed away by rain. Sinkholes had also developed in some roads. Spokesman George Mthethwa said the department was urging motorists to be cautious. “There are some areas where you find a collapsed bridge, which may cause potential human tragedy.” Mthethwa further appealed to those staying near flood-line areas and streams to vacate them as water levels were continuing to rise.  “The department has noted that the streams are becoming a danger to communities. We advise them to vacate those flood-line areas and move to safety,” he added. At least eight people were certified dead in the province since the tropical storm that started last week. Mthethwa said search operations for other drowning victims were continuing in different areas. He also raised concerns over people who continued to defy warnings.  “We are concerned that the number of drowning incidents is slightly to rise as we continue to receive reports of people who refuse to listen. We condemn such behaviour because we may soon experience fatalities,” he said. Mthethwa added that rain had been predicted for the whole weekend. “Chances are that even next week, we might still receive heavy rains, so we are in for a long haul. We remain on high alert as the storm continues to wreak havoc,” he said.
