NOT for the first time this
season, Kaizer Chiefs dropped points at home as they sunk 2-1 to AmaZulu at FNB
Stadium on Wednesday. A first half goal from Augustine Mulenga and a late
winner from Lehlohonolo Majoro accounted for Amakhosi’s sixth league loss this
season, a third successive defeat for Gavin Hunt’s team. The visitors went into the break in the lead, Mulenga
banging in the opener from a rebound on the stroke of halftime. It was due reward for the effort they put in the opening
half in which they pushed their bodies the ball and never held back against
their supposedly illustrious opponents. Or are they? In fact, Mulenga shook the crossbar with a rasping shot
on the half-hour mark, but this time came good. It wasn’t until the 67th minute that Amakhosi scored,
substitute Leonardo Castro coolly finishing from a penalty spot after Tapelo
Xoki had pulled Samir Nukorvic down inside the box. But Majoro came off the bench to condemn his former side
to a dispiriting defeat with an incredible loop. Nurkovic was denied by Veli Mothwa towards the end. But
that would have been an unfair result to Usuthu, who really punched above their
weight. Hunt bemoaned the fact that he wasn’t getting enough out
of his group and had implored them to do a little bit more. The manner of the latest defeat doesn’t suggest they
heeded his call. Meanwhile, Amakhosi will not be travelling to Egypt for
their Caf Champions League fixture against Wydad Athletic. The Egyptian FA have
pulled out of the deal to host their match at Al Salam Stadium.
