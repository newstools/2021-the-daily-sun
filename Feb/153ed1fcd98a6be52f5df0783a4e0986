As the world grapples with Covid-19, many things have sadly changed. How we socialise, travel and even exist has completely changed. As we slowly move towards a new normal, things such as how we learn will change, with the entire academic fraternity moving the classroom to technology. Online learning has become the new norm. According to recent trends, this is why it will be our new normal: 1.Flexibility Online education enables the teacher and student to set their own learning pace. There’s also the added flexibility of setting a schedule that fits everyone’s agenda. 2.Variety In a space as vast and wide as the Internet, there are infinite skills and subjects to teach and learn. A growing number of universities and higher education schools are offering online versions of their programmes for various levels and disciplines. 3.Accessibility Online education enables you to study or teach from anywhere in the world. This means there’s no need to commute from one place to another, or follow a rigid schedule.
