WHILE the debate about Covid-19 vaccines rages on, a retired nurse has decided to plant artemisia, known as lengana or umhlonyane. Strike Morudu (51) from Mmotong wa Perekisi outside Seshego in Limpopo believes the herb will help stem the spread of coronavirus. This medical herb has been used as a traditional cure for flu-related illnesses for many years and its demand has skyrocketed. “It has not been scientifically proven that it can safeguard people, but we grew up using this herb to cure colds, fever, coughs and headaches,” said Bra Strike, as he’s affectionately known. He plans to sell it at the local malls and taxi ranks. “I’m engaging local pharmacies to supply them with the herb and this is a step in the right direction as we are trying to save lives,” he said. Traditional healer Alpheus Monama from Peter Nchabeleng said planting lengana at home is not a good idea as it will lose its power to fight colds and flu. “The plant grows in the mountain and planting it at home will not be effective. It will not be as powerful as the one we harvest in the bushes.” The owner of Letebele Pharmacy in Blood River, known as Mr Lamola, confirmed that if Bra Strike supplied them with the herb they will sell it. In 2020, the Department of Higher Education allocated R15 million to research the use of artemisia.
