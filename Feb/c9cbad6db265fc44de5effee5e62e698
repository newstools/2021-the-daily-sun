BAFANA Bafana striker Dino Ndlovu gave his wife the best ever valentines gift she could ever imagine, a Porsche 911 Carrera on Sunday. The 31-year-old striker who plies his trade in China for Zhejiang Greentown surprised his wife with a beast car that is estimated at R3 million. In a video posted on his Instagram account, Ndlovu made the day special for his wife by hiring a pianist as he went all out to impress his partner. He wrote: “The enemy will regret messing with you! God is about to restore you massively in the name of Jesus!  Get ready for abundantly above all you can ask or think #HappyVday” A post shared by Ndlovu Dino (@dino_ndlovu)   A post shared by Ndlovu Dino (@dino_ndlovu)
