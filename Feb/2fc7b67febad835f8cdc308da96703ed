BONGANI Zungu has overcome his first hurdle in his bid to win back the trust of Steven Gerrard and also his place in the Rangers team. This is after Gerrard, the Rangers coach, accepted Zungu’s apology, thus including him back in the team that played Antwerp in their Europa League clash on Thursday. Zungu was suspended after he violated the Covid-19 regulations when he, with three other players, attended a house party in Glasgow last week. The 28-year-old showed remorse for his actions, seen as he issued an apology to the club and the fans. In a joint statement with Gerrard and Sporting Director Ross Wilson, confirmed Zungu was back in training after his apology was accepted by the club. “The first-team squad players have now returned to Auchenhowie. We are both now satisfied that the players completely understand their obligations to our club and accept with sincerity the strong disciplinary sanctions that we have imposed upon them for letting us all down,” said Gerrard. “We accept their apologies to the club, their teammates and the fans, for whom we are forever grateful for their resolute support and loyalty. “Over the last week, we have both ensured that all our players understand our expectations when you are part of this great club. "The players involved have been left in no uncertain terms as to the standards that everyone here is expected to adhere to. "It has been an extremely difficult week for those players following their admission of an error of judgement whilst dealing with the consequences of their actions. "Our internal discussions were supported by the immediate honesty shown by the players and an appreciation they fell well below the standards we expect at Rangers Football Club, day in and day out. Those standards form the foundation that we have set as a club to achieve our targets as a team.“
