SATURDAY marked a huge moment for Etienne Eto'o, the son of Samuel Eto'o. The 18-year-old featured for Cameroon's Under 20 side for the first time in the Under 20 Africa Cup of Nations. The youngster dropped a Man of the Match performance, scoring twice and assisting another as his side won 4-1 against Mozambique in the final group stage fixture. His first goal was a well taken free-kick that opened the scoring in the seventh minute before he added a penalty in first-half stoppage time.
