FORMER Polokwane City and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila goalkeeper Bongani Manavhela has put his football career on hold. The 28-year-old is now focusing on his music career as he has been struggling to find a team. Manavhela has opened a studio in Venda and is busy working on his single gospel album. "I did not find a team this season and I decided to do something that I love which is music," said Manavhela. "I still want to play football, but what can you do if you are not getting a team. I am thankful to God for giving me a singing and football talent. If one is not working, then I can do the other so that I can put food on the table." Manavhela played for Tshakhuma while they were still campaigning in the GladAfrica Championship in 2017 and had a good season which promoted Rise and Shine to buy him in 2018. But he struggled for game time at City and was loaned to Championship side TS Sporting the following year. Last season, Manavhela joined Championship side JDR, but things did not go well for him as he lasted only six months. "My manager is doing all he can to find a new team," he explained. "I still believe that I can still play as I am still young. But for now, I am focusing on my music career. Who knows, maybe this is what I am born to do. I will wait and see what happens next season." Last year, Manavhela was lucky to survive a car accident in Nzhelele and he managed to overcome the setback to focus on building his music empire.
