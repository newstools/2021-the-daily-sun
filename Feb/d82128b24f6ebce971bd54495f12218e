SINGER Vusi Nova has lifted the lid on his drug addition, losing his mother to HIV – and how he recklessly spent the money she left him. Speaking to Jon Savage on What’s Your Poison, he recalled how, as a teen, he moved to Jozi from Port Elizabeth and how that led to his addiction that carried on for years. “It all started with a joint here and there, before moving to 20 joints a day and then I went on to Mandrax, crack, cocaine, Ecstasy and more. I went all the way. I got really addicted to crack and it went on for years.” Vusi said losing his mum was one of the most painful things ever to happen in his life.

My mother left me a lot of cash when she passed and, as my way of grieving, I spent all of that money. “My mother was HIV-positive and for the longest time, I was telling people that she has cancer, because I was afraid of how people would label her. The shame made my drug use more extreme.” The singer said now that he no longer was on drugs, he wanted to give his mum the honour she deserved and of all the lessons she had taught him, has made up the album he has dedicated to her.
