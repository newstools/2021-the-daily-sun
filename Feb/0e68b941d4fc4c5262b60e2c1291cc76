Since then, Robert has spoken about his marriage with Zinhle. “Consciously, I have taught my children, my family and even my wife that abuse in any form is wrong and it must never be tolerated irrespective of who dishes it. That behavior must be confronted immediately and everyone in the house must never be stopped from reporting such to authorities and law enforcement agencies. It is a principle I teach and live by,” he said in a statement. “To lead by this example, when I, at some point in my own marriage felt abused by my own wife, not only did I seek a restraining order, but I even laid a complaint with the police because I couldn’t stand physical abuse,” he said.

These are the teachings of my family,” said Robert. “Let it be noted that divorce is a very draining and emotionally exhausting process for anyone to go through," he said.
