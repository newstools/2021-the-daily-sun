CYPRIAN (65) and Ethel Mtyawazo (57) from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, have been desperately looking for their son Patric (36). But they said greedy izangoma have taken the last cent they had. When Patric went missing last April, his parents looked everywhere for him. “We were then advised izangoma could help us trace him. The first one we went to told us his bones showed him Patric was still alive,” said Cyprian. He said the sangoma demanded R15 000 to show them where Patric was. Although both Cyprian and his wife were unemployed, they found the money. “He said we should wait for him to communicate with his ancestors. He said it could take a few days or weeks. “When we tried to get our money back, he disappeared. He said he was working in KZN and would come back but never did.”  They were referred to another sangoma, who told them Patric was alive. “He said he charged R12 000 but wouldn’t take the money until he found our son. He asked for R5 000 for ukukhanyisa and said we’d pay the rest later. He wasn’t able to trace Patric and we lost that money.” The last sangoma they saw made them pay him R5 000 to go to Bloemfontein and R2 000 for a consultation. “We went with him to Bloemfontein, but when we got there we looked everywhere and never found Patric,” said Ethel. “All we want is to find our son. We want anyone who’s seen him to reach out to the police or Daily Sun.” The SunTeam couldn’t reach the first two izangoma, but the third said the ancestors sent him in the right direction. But when they got to Bloemfontein they couldn’t find Patric. “I was not scamming them. I wouldn’t have gone with them to Bloemfontein if I was,” he said. Captain Mavela Masondo said a missing persons case was opened.
