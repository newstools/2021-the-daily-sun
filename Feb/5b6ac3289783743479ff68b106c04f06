THE vaccine has finally arrived in Mzansi and healthcare workers are first in line to get the jab. But nurses are not happy about this. A nurse based at Carletonville Clinic said she was not going to take the jab as they were not told about the side effects. “I think the Department of Health is dropping the ball big time. We’re expected to roll with the punches, but we were not given the right information yet we are expected to administer the vaccine. “Patients will have questions on what to expect after vaccination and we don’t know anything about the vaccine. We are scared to take it,” she said. President of Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union, Lerato Mthunzi, said Covid-19 shenanigans will show how flawed the health system is. “The approach in dealing with the virus itself was flawed from the start. You cannot set up tents in all hospitals and expect to contain the virus. “Having one Covid-19 dedicated hospital in all regions would have helped,” she said. She said nurses had many questions including how effective the vaccine is as there is a new strain. Mthunzi said nurses will have to explain procedures to patients, but couldn’t without proper training and understanding of the vaccine. “The employer is letting us down. As much as people like to criticise nurses, we need to understand that the bad conditions they work under affect them badly. “They sometimes have to buy things from their own pockets and one nurse is expected to look after more than four or five patients while the ratio is supposed to be one-to-one in the ICU and one-to-two in a normal ward,” she said. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize urged nurses to register on the vaccination data system to get their jabs.
