DRESSED in an all-black suit, cleanly shaven and full of confidence, Ntuthuko Shoba posed for the flashing cameras as he walked up the auditorium. The 32-year-old was implicated in the gruesome murder of pregnant Tshegofatso Pule as the mastermind. He’s known as the boyfriend of the late Pule, who allegedly paid Muzikayise Malephane R70 000 to get rid of Pule in an attempt to hide from his wife that the deceased was pregnant with his child. Shoba appeared briefly in the Roodepoort Margistrates Court for the first time. His case was postponed to 1 March for a formal bail application. When asked to present himself to the court, he said: “I am Ntuthuko Shoba and this is my attorney who will be assisting me with my case.”  Police confirmed that Shoba was arrested on Thursday evening, the day before Malephane’s sentencing. Pule’s uncle Tumisang Katake said Shoba’s arrest came as a relief to the family, but opened wounds. “Seeing him today on that stand brought so much pain to us as a family because many of us are seeing him for the first time. We don’t know how the case will unfold, but all our suspicions have been confirmed. We knew that one way or another he was involved,” said Katake. He said they will continue being patient and attend each appearance until everything is finalised. Pule’s body was found hanging in a tree last June in Durban Deep, Roodepoort. This after she had been missing for four days and later discovered by a passerby.
