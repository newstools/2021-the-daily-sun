MORE than 60 porters at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town refused to work on Monday and Tuesday, after allegedly not receiving their salaries. The porters, who were employed by labour broking company Staffing Direct Recruitment, told Daily Sun they were supposed to be paid on Friday. They said they received a payment on Monday, but it wasn’t the full salary. Group leader Siseko Kanzi said: “They only deposited the money on Monday after we put down our tools and said we wouldn’t work until we were paid. “Even now we have received salaries that are short. We’ve been victimised for far too long and we’re saying enough is enough.” The porters said instead of getting full pay, they received amounts between R500 and R1 200. Porter Simphiwe Jongose said they got salaries of between R2 000 and R5 000, and had not received increases since 2016. “We’ve got families and can’t continue getting this kind of money. When you raise these things with the agency, you’re threatened that you will lose your job,” she said. Western Cape health department spokesman Byron la Hoe said they were informed that porters were paid on 1 February. He said the issue was being handled by the company that employed them. Speaking on behalf of the company, Richard Brown of Herold Gie Attorneys said an agreement was reached with workers on Tuesday. He said they were all back at work and no one was fired for the protest action. “We’ve reached an agreement and I can say everyone is happy. “We’ve signed a collective agreement that will ensure stability in the workplace for the coming two years,” said Brown. He apologised for the inconvenience the protest action caused to the hospital and patients.
