WITH strong rains in Limpopo recently, parents are urged to keep an extra eye on their children as streams and rivers were full to capacity. On Wednesday, two teenage boys – Thabang Mohale (16) and Maropeng Maphoto (15) – were allegedly swimming with friends when they got swept away. They both drowned in Letaba River near Lemondokop village outside Modjadjiskloof. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said when they were notified, a joint search operation was activated, consisting of the SAPS Water Wing and other role players. They searched the river until they found two lifeless bodies that were successfully retrieved on Friday. “We would like to warn community members to be extra vigilant when crossing the flooded rivers and dams. We also warn parents to take full care of their children to prevent these incidents from happening,” Ngoepe said. Meanwhile, nine-year-old boy Ntsieni Muupo from Pfananani village also drowned while swimming with friends in a dam. His lifeless body was recovered this morning when local residents took it upon themselves to search for him.
