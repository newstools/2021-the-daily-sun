THE head of the Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit in Mahikeng, North West, has been arrested on shoplifting allegations. Jeanette Neveling was allegedly caught with groceries and clothes at The Crossing Shopping Centre Woolworths in Mahikeng on Tuesday afternoon. According to sources, she pleaded with the authorities to keep quiet about her arrest as it could jeopardise her career. “She’s doing cases in the North West including the one of former finance MEC Wendy Nelson,” a source said. “She’s heading the most crucial unit that deals with crime.” ISIBAYA ACTRESS ARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER!
