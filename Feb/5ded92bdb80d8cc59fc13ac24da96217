FORMER Dusi Canoe Marathon (K2) champion Sibonelo Khwela has had a rough couple of months. The 33-year-old paddling machine lost his mother last year due to Covid-19. The pandemic did not just rob Khwela of his number one supporter, but it also affected his livelihood. Khwela, who hails from the Valley of a Thousand Hills in KwaZulu-Natal, lost some of his sponsors when the pandemic was at its peak. He even contemplated quitting the sport he loves because it just did not bring in enough income. Khwela went from eating, living and breathing canoe racing to nearly falling out of love with it. But his relentless nature did not allow him to throw in the towel. He has unfinished business with the sport with one particular goal in sight. Khwela, who won the Dusi Canoe Marathon doubles (K2) with Andy Birkett in 2014, still dreams of clinching the singles (K1) title. He would be the first black canoeist to achieve the feat. It’s a dream he used to share with his late mother and wants to it achieve in her memory. “I have gone through a tough period because of this pandemic,” Khwela told SunSport. “I lost my number one supporter in my mom. She was one of the reasons I was doing this. I knew I could count on her support every time I competed. In addition to that, I lost some of my sponsors during this pandemic,which had a negative effect on my livelihood.” Khwela believes his dream of becoming the first black man to win the Dusi Canoe Marathon in the singles (K1) is well within reach. The K2 and K1 Non-Stop Dusi record holder will be lining up for the popular race from Pietermaritzburg to Durban next month with one goal in mind. “I want to win for my mother,” added Khwela.
