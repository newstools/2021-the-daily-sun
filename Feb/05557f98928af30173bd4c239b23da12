LIEUTENANT-GENERAL Mondli Zuma has urged troubled cops to seek help. This comes after a female constable (28) reportedly shot the father (33) of her child and her five-month-old baby girl before turning the gun on herself. The incident took place at Embalenhle near Secunda, Mpumalanga, on Saturday. The Mpumalanga police commissioner told Daily Sun: “Police and medical personnel were notified about the incident and the woman was certified dead at the scene. “Her daughter and the father of her child were taken to a nearby clinic, where the man died upon arrival. “The little girl was transferred to hospital but later died. Police have registered two cases.” He said such tragic incidents could have been avoided if the affected parties had sought professional help. “We have an employee health and wellness section which specialises in the wellness of members. “They offer their services without expecting payment. “Those professionals are paid by the state. “I urge all members to effectively make use of this and be alleviated of any social pressures they might encounter.”
