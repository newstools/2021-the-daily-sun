THE ANC in KZN is grieving once again after losing another member today. Former KZN MEC for Agriculture and ANC KZN Provincial Executive Council member Meshack Radebe has died. Radebe died hours ago at his Maqongqo home outside Pietermaritzburg. The circumstances of his death were still not clear. He was a close ally of former president Jacob Zuma. KZN ANC spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela confirmed the sad news. “Meshack Radebe is no more. RIP Bhungane. More details will follow once we interact with the family,” he said, adding that he died in hospital. “Let us keep the family in our prayers,” said Ntombela.
