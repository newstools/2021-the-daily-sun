NEW AmaZulu signing Zukile Kewuti can’t wait to get started with his new side. Kewuti joined Usuthu on loan from Cape Town City on Thursday. At Usuthu, he’s reunited with his former coach Benni McCarthy and his assistant Vasili Manousakis. These are two individuals who gave Kewuti his PSL debut when he was promoted in the 2017-18 season, in a season McCarthy was appointed as a City head coach before he was sacked in November 2019. Kewuti played a key role as McCarthy won his first ever trophy as head coach when City defeated SuperSport United in the MTN8 trophy in 2018 in Durban. “The move to Usuthu was a great move because I know their technical staff, I know what they want and it’s all about winning and they installed that mentality with me,” said Kewuti in his first words at the club. “I’m also about winning. I’m here to win many games and win everything that is left this season. I’m not here just to add numbers, but I’m here to work.” It was clear as daylight that Kewuti wasn’t the first choice this season. Under McCarthy’s successor, Olde Jan Riekerink, he only featured in 55 minutes. The Dutch coach preferred Thabo Nodada and Thato Mokeke in that holding midfielder role and both players have done well, which made it hard for Kewuti to get a looking. But having watched Usuthu from afar, the Nyanga-born player has been impressed with the team’s willingness to win. Kewuti come to the side that has won four games on the bounce in all competitions, and have climbed up the log table to seventh with 21 points from 15 games. The Durban-based side will face Swallows FC at Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm) and Kewuti is set to form part of the side in Soweto. “For me AmaZulu at this moment in time, it is aright team to join because what I saw today everyone is willing to work, is willing to learn,” he said. “Everyone wants to achieve many things and I’m looking forward to be wearing the green jersey of AmaZulu.”
