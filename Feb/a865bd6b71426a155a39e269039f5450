Four people
are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Friday for the
theft of copper worth around R1.9 million. The four
people, who are understood to be Transnet employees, were arrested following
operations in Pretoria last week, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo
Mulamu. "[The]
Hawks'Â  Serious Organised Crime
Investigation [Unit] in Pretoria conducted an intelligence-driven operation
that resulted in the arrests of the four men at [the] Transnet Infrastructure
Freight Rail Koedoespoort Depot in Pretoria," said Mulamu. Provincial
head, Major-General Ebrahim Kadwa, commended the investigation team for their
swift response. SOURCE:
