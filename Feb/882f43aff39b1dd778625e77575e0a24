AS A child, she had big dreams of becoming a famous baker one day. But her life is going nowhere. The truth is that the woman (24) cannot read, write or speak English. Her name is withheld to protect her dignity. She moved from Stoffel Park in Mamelodi, Tshwane, to Lethabong to maintain her secret, and a friend organised her an interview. “My friend worked at a restaurant and told me it was hiring. I told her that I couldn’t read or write. She drafted a CV for me and assured me the interview would be in Sepedi.” But the supervisor conducted it in English, and the woman was escorted off the premises because she couldn’t speak it.  The embarrassment reminded her that she had tried to kill herself twice before. “If it wasn’t for my two children, I would have committed suicide.” A woman in their kasi found her a job cleaning toilets, but again, she was mocked. “I was depressed and left the job. I feel I don’t have a purpose on this earth.” She said a teacher tried to help and took her to a psychologist. “But I stopped going because they wanted me to write.”
