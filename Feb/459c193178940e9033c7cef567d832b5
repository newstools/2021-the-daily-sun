BOXING legend Mzimasi “Bra Mzi” Mnguni has died. The 73-year-old died on Saturday after a long illness. Bra Mzi trained many boxers at Eyethu Boxing Gym in Mdantsane, Eastern Cape. The first boxer to ask Bra Mzi for help was Mveleli “Sugar Ray” Luzipho, who at the time was a South African Junior Flyweight champion. Former boxer and long-time friend, Vuyani Bungu, praised him for his ability to manage a crisis and make best calls in tough situations. He said Bra Mzi had a wide knowledge of boxing technique and produced champions in Mzansi and internationally. “He had the ability to put people at ease and create an environment for boxers to express their talent,” said Vuyani. “Bra Mzi was like a father to me. As much as we knew he was very sick, hearing news of his passing was sad.” Bra Mzi’s brother Sihle told the People’s Paper his brother was a pillar in their family. “Other families depended on him because he was a businessman,” said Sihle. “At times he helped to pay fees. Our hearts are broken. It’s not just the family that lost him, but the world as well.” Buffalo City Mayor Xola Pakati described Bra Mzi as a great giant who was known around the globe for producing world champions. “His life work has inspired many other generations of boxers in South Africa,” said the mayor. He said Bra Mzi’s life was a testimony of selfless sacrifice and community development through sports. “He took many young people off the streets and made them boxing legends,” Pakati told Daily Sun. “His work also inspired generations of young fighters.” Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said Bra Mzi invested his time, energy and wisdom in boxing. Bra Mzi will be buried in his home village, Dikeni, on Sunday.
