KAIZER Chiefs third choice goalkeeper Brylon Petersen has completed a BSc Engineering (Mechanical) Degree at Wits. He has already prepared for his future when the ball stops rolling. The youngster has been struggling to break into Amakhosi’s last line of defence with Itumeleng Khune and Nigerian Danial Akpeyi being coach Gavin Hunt’s preferred choice and maybe this made him realise the importance of having something to fall back on. Petersen joins some other players who've also earned degrees include former Chiefs stars Tefu Mashamaite, Jimmy Tau, Tsepo Masilela and Lehlohonolo Majoro. Halala! Congratulations to @brylon_petersen for completing your BSc Engineering (Mechanical) Degree at Wits. We are proud of you!#Amakhosi4Life pic.twitter.com/rd8QlwjIXH
