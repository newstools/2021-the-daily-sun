WHEN it comes to observing the rule of law and protecting the Constitution, former president Jacob Zuma always speaks with a forked tongue. He says one thing about observing the rule of law, then does the opposite through delaying tactics, attacking the judiciary or refusing to recognise the courts when judgments go against him. After exhausting his legal rights to disregard a summons from the Zondo Commission, the very same Zuma – who once pledged to protect the Constitution – has arrogantly lifted a fat finger to this nation by refusing to present himself at the commission. Zuma is expected to appear from 15 to 19 February but arrogantly issued a statement on Monday that he will not obey a Constitutional Court order that compels him to appear. DRIVE-THROUGH SANGOMA! He stressed he will no longer co-operate with the commission on state capture. The ex-president is not ashamed to draw a salary from taxpayers for his and his spouses’ upkeep, enjoying benefits of the same Constitution he is trampling on. What is equally shameless is the deafening silence of the ANC, which is yet to take Zuma to task. A swift arrest of the former state president for violating the Constitution must be effected if he fails to show up. This will send a message. Our constitutional democracy will be reduced to a laughing stock if it does not happen. – Editor
