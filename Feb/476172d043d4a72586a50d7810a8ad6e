FORMER president Jacob Zuma has hit back at criticism of him for not honouring the Constitutional Court ruling that he must appear before the State Capture Commission. In a long letter, Zuma claimed the judiciary was interfering in politics. He also claimed society was blinded by hatred of him. He wrote: “What society looks the other way when a judge adjudicates a matter involving his own disputed facts? “What judicial system tolerates a judge admitting that he concealed a fact in his statement relating to whether he had ever met with me during my tenure as president?” Zuma challenged the nation to look closely to his replying affidavit in his application to have Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo recused from the commission. He claimed everyone looked the other way when obvious errors by Zondo, the chairman of the commission, were hidden. Zuma also questioned the integrity of some of the judges who presided over his many other cases. He went on to accuse some of accepting bribes and of helping President Cyril Ramaphosa conceal bank statements relating to his campaign to become ANC leader. “I protest against our black, red and green robes dressing up some individuals that have long betrayed the Constitution and their oath of office,” he wrote. “It is those who allow it and look the other way that must do some reflection. You do not have to like me to do this reflection. “Some in our so-called intelligentsia have become blinded by their prejudice towards me. They agree that the court may take away my right to remain silent yet they fail to recognise that the Zondo Commission has already extended this to at least three witnesses that appeared before it.” He said he was merely demanding justice, fairness and impartiality, all of which were things judges should not be reminded of.
