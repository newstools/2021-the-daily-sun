TODAY, the much-anticipated first batch of Covid-19 vaccines arrived in the country from India. The one million doses manufactured by AstraZeneca and produced by the Serum Institute of India brings hope after waves of Covid-19 deaths engulfed us in the past few weeks. When it comes to coronavirus-related deaths, Mzansi has never seen anything like this. New cases shot up to over 20 000 infections a day during this deadly second peak. ALSO READ:VACCINE LANDS IN SUNLAND! We saw whole families being wiped out and family members unable to bury loved ones as they themselves struggled to breathe in hospitals. The vaccine is our first step to starting a journey of healing and to defeat this virus. After massive scandals linking state officials to PPE tenders, and a slow response by law enforcement to put culprits behind bars, many are sceptical that the roll-out will not be tainted by corruption. This is because major national programmes, such as school feeding schemes and building of RDPs, have been mired in corruption. Shameless thieves and looters have showed us black lives don’t matter when it comes to lining their pockets. President Cyril Ramaphosa and his cabinet must not allow corruption to mess with this important roll-out. – Editor
