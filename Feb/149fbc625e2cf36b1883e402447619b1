THE non-stop rainfall has left many parents wishing schools were open. This is because the storm has resulted in dams and rivers getting full to capacity and kids are swimming in these dams and rivers. Parents are concerned and afraid they may lose their kids. Maite Mashego (37) from Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, said they were not always home to guard their kids as most of them are working. “They pretend as if they’re listening to us when we reprimand them, but once we leave our homes they do the opposite,’’ she said. “We’re afraid to spank them because we don’t want to get arrested. “We no longer know what to do to make them listen to us. We can’t lock them in their rooms. We’re afraid one of them might be washed away.” The Letaba River in Ga-Sekgopo Village is also full and overflowing and kids flock there every day. Solly Rathaga (40) said: “The only way they can play far from the river is if they’re in school. We know when they come back they do their homework and after that it’s too late for them to go out.” Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo warned residents not to swim in rivers and dams during these times. “Parents should urge their children to stop playing in rivers and dams as they can drown or be washed away,” said Mojapelo. “We also encourage parents to know their children’s whereabouts at all times.”
