HAZYVIEW police in Mpumalanga have launched a manhunt to find unknown suspects who allegedly hijacked a Ram courier van. The incident happened on R536 roads near Bush Paradise in Shabalala Trust outside Hazyview, Mpumalanga, on Friday, 26 February. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the driver and his assistant were heading towards Mkhuhlu and had stopped due to ongoing construction. Four unknown men approached their vehicle, where three then pointed a firearm at the van.  “They allegedly instructed the driver and his assistant to remain silent while they covered themselves with masks and balaclavas. One suspect drove the vehicle to Shabalala bushes and ordered them to get off and lie down, at gunpoint,” he said. “The suspects were allegedly joined by another bakkie that loaded the parcel. The workers were also robbed of their cellphones and then locked in the back of the van. The suspects then fled the scene,” he added. “A case of robbery was open for investigation and a manhunt has been launched against the suspects. We believe the suspects might be responsible for robberies of Ram courier vans around Hazyview after another one was robbed at the Marite area earlier this month. We urge anyone with information to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111,” said Hlathi.
