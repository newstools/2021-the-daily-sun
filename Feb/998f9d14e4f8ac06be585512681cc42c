THREE officials at the Nkowankowa Sassa branch, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, are expected to appear in the magistrates court tomorrow. They were nabbed by the Hawks on Monday for allegedly defrauding the grant payment agency of over R300 000 from 2018 to 2019. They allegedly “sold” disability grants to recipients who didn’t qualify for the grant. Sassa’s regional executive manager in Limpopo, Zodwa Mvulane, said the beneficiaries allegedly paid R3 500 to officials, who captured their banking details as qualifying beneficiaries. No medical information, or a report from a medical officer confirming their disability status, was provided. “We’re working to eliminate fraud and corruption linked to disability grants,” she said. Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said: “Our investigations revealed that over 21 people were recruited and paid R3 500.” The department suffered a loss of over R300 000. “The suspects include three Sassa officials in the Nkowankowa branch, one intermediary and eight non-qualifying Sassa beneficiaries,” he said. All the suspects will appear in court on fraud and corruption charges. Investigations continue.
