MEDIA personality and businessman Sizwe Dhlomo has rubbished rumours he’ll join Ukhozi FM in April. Rumours that Sizwe will be joining the station started last week after he tweeted the word “Olumaphikophiko”, an Ukhozi FM catchphrase. Uphiko is Zulu for wing, while Ukhozi refers to an eagle in that language. Radio lovers interpreted this as confirmation of him joining the station, with some alleging he’ll replace Tshatha Ngobe, who was suspended. When Daily Sun called Sizwe, who has a show on Kaya FM, he laughed and told the SunTeam to call Ukhozi for confirmation. “At the moment I’m still happy with Kaya FM, but if Ukhozi gives me a show I’ll nail it because I know their style. “I agree. I posted Ukhozi’s praise names on Twitter. Nothing wrong with that. I grew up listening to Ukhozi.” Sizwe said he’s happy where he is but loves Ukhozi. “I still love it and listen to Ukhozi,” he said. “As I’m talking to you, I’m coming back home to KZN and I was listening to Ukhozi. “There’s nothing wrong with listening to Ukhozi even though I’m a Kaya presenter. Ukhozi made me love radio.” SABC acting spokeswomen Mmoni Seapolelo would neither confirm nor deny the rumours. “Ukhozi FM changes will be announced in April, and we’ll find out if there’s a new presenter. “We normally don’t announce changes before April. Please, let’s wait for April.”
