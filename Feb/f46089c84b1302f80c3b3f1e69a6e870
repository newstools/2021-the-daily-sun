WHEN SHE got the news of her son’s tragic death six months ago, Tebogo Itsweng was torn apart. But her agony gets worse every day as she waits for the postmortem results. SHE CAN’T BURY HER SON BECAUSE THERE IS NO BODY TO LAY TO REST! Tebogo (44) from Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane, said her son George (26) died in a car accident in August on his way home after visiting friends in Ga-Rankuwa. WORKER BUYS COVID SALIVA TO KILL BOSS! George’s body was burnt beyond recognition. “Waiting over six months to bury him is so painful,” she told Daily Sun. “This is hard on me and the family. I can’t sleep, I’m traumatised.” She sometimes dreams of George crying and wearing black clothes. Tebogo said the body was taken for a post mortem, but it hasn’t been returned for burial. “I can’t take it anymore. I feel like I’m living in a never-ending nightmare,” she said. “I just want to bury him and mourn him properly.”  Tebogo said police failed to speed up the post mortem. The mum of three said her two other kids, aged 6 and 10, are always asking where their brother is. “When I tell them he died, they ask when he’ll be buried,” she said. “I’m powerless and without hope. I need closure.” Captain Bonginkosi Msimango said police are still investigating a culpable homicide case. “Two bodies are awaiting DNA comparison at the forensic science laboratory and the postmortem results are outstanding,” said Msimango. He wasn’t sure when the results would be available.
