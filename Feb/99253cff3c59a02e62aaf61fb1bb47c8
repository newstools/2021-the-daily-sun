A LIMPOPO man was arrested in Lethuli Park, in Seshego outside Polokwane, for impersonating a police captain and scamming job seekers. The suspect appeared in the Polokwane Magistrates Court on Monday. The 28-year-old man appeared before Magistrate Jenin Ungerer on fraud and corruption charges after allegedly swindling job seekers of thousands of rands under false pretences. He posed as a recruitment officer from head office. Prosecutor Pearl Ledwaba postponed the case to 24 February for a bail application and profile report. The accused was remanded in police custody. “The state is ready to oppose the bail application,” said Ledwaba. His lawyer, Advocate Ephraim Mabotja, walked into court as the accused was about to take the stand and introduced himself. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the man allegedly pretended to be a captain from human resources, told unsuspecting people who wanted jobs as police officers to deposit money into various accounts for medical reports. He told them to go to the recruitment office with their receipt as proof of payment. “Upon arrival, the victims were shocked to learn they were scammed, and an intelligence-driven joint operation was activated. Finally, the suspect was arrested on Friday,” said Ngoepe. The suspect may be linked to other similar cases as police investigations are continuing. “Police won’t request or demand cash for any reason during the recruitment process or investigations,” he said. “The police recruitment forms are not for sale and our posts are advertised on different media platforms with clear specifications. “Members of the community must report these types of tendencies to the police immediately.”
