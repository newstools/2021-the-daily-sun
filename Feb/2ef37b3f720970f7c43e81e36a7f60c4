Cape Town Spurs will be eyeing a timely boost when they take aim at Baroka FC in a Nedbank Cup last-32 fixture at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Monday. Kick-off is at 5pm CAT (SA, GMT+2). Spurs (formerly Ajax Cape Town) have struggled in their pursuit of promotion this season and head into the cup fixture in 15th spot on the GladAfrica Championship standings. Urban Warriors captain Thendo Mukumela is hopeful that the Nedbank Cup will serve as a springboard for success in the league. "I think the Nedbank Cup is a stepping stone," said Mukumela. "In a way, we do want to prove to everybody that we can still do this, we’re still in this and we still want to win the league. I think the Nedbank Cup helps us in terms of seeing how certain players are performing. "Also, if we beat Baroka on Monday, this will give us more confidence because beating a Premiership team will show us that we can get to the top of the league standings. "We’ve watched them play a lot so we know how they play and I think we’re ready – we’re going to give them one hell of a game," Mukumela added. Bakgaga are winless in three DStv Premiership matches heading into the cup fixture following a 1-1 draw at home to Cape Town City last time out. The Limpopo team beat Polokwane City, Hungry Lions and Black Leopards on their way to reaching the semi-=finals of the Nedbank Cup last season, before suffering a 3-0 loss to eventual runners-up Bloemfontein Celtic. Spurs, who reached the final while still named Ajax Cape Town in 2015, exited last season's tournament in the round of 32 following a penalty shoot-out defeat to TS Sporting. -SuperSport
