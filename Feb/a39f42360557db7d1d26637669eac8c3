A POLICE constable has been arrested for allegedly being involved in a cash-in-transit heist. The suspect (38) appeared before the Vaalbank Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on Thursday, 4 February, but he was remanded in custody pending a formal bail hearing on 11 February. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Dineo Sekgotodi, the suspect was arrested on Tuesday during the crime intelligence-driven operation conducted by members of the Hawks in Mpumalanga, CIT tracking team attached to the Hawks head office and Kwamhlanga’s crime intelligence. “Two of his alleged co-accused were taken in for questioning and later released. But the arrested suspect was allegedly linked to a cash-in-transit incident that happened in the early hours of Monday, 1 February, involving three security guards who were transporting an undisclosed amount of money to several ATMs around Moutse West,” she said. “The security guards were accosted by unknown suspects driving an Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz. Several shots were fired at the armed vehicle, causing it to stop. They were then disarmed and explosives were used to gain access to the money bags. The suspects fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash in several vehicles,” she continued.  “Three cars, including a Mercedes Benz, Audi Q3 and A4 were later found abandoned in different locations near Vaalbank.” Sekgotodi added that investigations revealed the Mercedes Benz had been stolen in Jeppe in February, the A4 in Yeoville in December and Q3 in Sebenza in October, all in 2020. A charcoal Kia Rio was also found abandoned. It was also reported stolen in Secunda in July. “The Hawks-led team recovered R30 000 from a sangoma, used as payment to perform some rituals for the protection of the suspects so they can evade arrest,” Sekgotodi said.
