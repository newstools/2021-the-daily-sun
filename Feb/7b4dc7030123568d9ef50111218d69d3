THERE’S a saying which goes: “Teamwork makes the dreamwork.” And Mziwokuthula Zimu seems to be a true believer of that old proverb. The veteran striker has put aside his personal target of 10 goals this season to ensure his side JDR win promotion at the end of the season. Zimu, who has a wealth of experience in the Championship, joined the Hammer Boys in December. His presence has been felt as he has scored some crucial goals since his arrival. But he insists that it is not about him scoring goals, it is all about team effort. Zimu said he had a target of 10 goals, however, at this stage, believes personal glory can wait as they are chasing the bigger fish as a team. After 15 matches, JDR are among the early pacesetters. They are joint leaders with Sekhukhune, Richards Bay and Real Kings having accumulated 24 points each team. Only goal difference separates them. Zimu said: “I think we are in a good position. “We do not want to be at the top because we will become a target and all the teams will plan around us. “It is better this way. Like all the teams, the goal is the same – to win automatic promotion and only one team will win. “As a team (JDR), we’ve got our plans in place and we are fully aware that we will need to work as a collective to achieve the goal. That is one of the reasons I have even put my (goal) target on ice. “Yes, as a striker my job is to score goals, but I cannot pay too much attention to that because here we are working as a team. It does not matter who scores. What matters is the three points on the day."
