NONKOLISO Mkuba (40) from Siyahlala squatter camp in Philippi Browns Farm in Cape Town, Western Cape, needs help to bury her son. Asange Mkuba died in a fire incident last Saturday. Nonkoliso was at work at the time. “I was working the night shift. At around 4.20am, I received a call from a neighbour informing me about the fire. She didn’t say anything about my son,” she said. Upon arrival, she was shocked to find the police in her yard. “As soon I saw police officers, I knew that someone had died and thought it was all my three kids,” the single mum added. “I don’t earn much, so I need help to bury my son with dignity.” The grieving mum also needed assistance in paying for the DNA test. Even though she was feeling the pain of losing her eldest son, she was grateful to God for her remaining kids. “My 15-year-old son told me that he fought with his brother over a cellphone. He then decided to run away and sleep at my neighbour’s house, taking my youngest child (almost two years old) with him,” she said. She added that had it not been for the siblings’ fight, she would have lost all her kids. “I have a lot of unanswered questions on what happened – how the fire started and why my son died. I cannot say a vutha was sent to kill my family. I am just confused.” Nonkoliso said she would bury her son in Butterworth, Eastern Cape. “I cannot think of anyone who would want to see me suffer. That is why I have so many questions. The worst part is that my son died crying for help,” she added. She said her neighbours told her that Asange cried, asking them to rescue him from the burning house. “I feel bad that I was not there to save him. I am grateful to my neighbours because they tried.” Her neighbour said they tried to save him but it was too late. “Her son was a lovely child who respected everyone in the community. We have lost a good kid,” said the neighbour. This year, Asange was going to start grade 11 at Sithembele Matiso High School.
