TEARS of joy and relief flowed down the faces of people in the gallery of the Palm Ridge Regional Court when two life sentences were handed down to Lungile Nxelelwa. Nxelelwa was convicted on Tuesday, 9 February of raping, killing and mutilating his lover Keneilwe Pule in 2019. An additional five-year sentence was handed down to the 32-year-old from Evaton, south of Joburg, on one count of attempted murder. Keneilwe was raped and sliced up with a grinder before she was set alight. Before Keneilwe was murdered, she had found her brother Teboho, who had been missing since birth. Teboho said he was happy to reunite with his family. “It took hard work and sleepless nights to find my sister, and I was overjoyed when I found her. “I was saddened and very broken when I heard about her gruesome death.” He said nothing would bring back his sister and his pain couldn’t be undone. “This man deserves the sentence he got, and I hope this is a lesson to every man who abuses women,” he said. Keneilwe’s aunt, Masechaba, told the People’s Paper she was happy with the sentence. “We’re going to be at peace spiritually. The court played its role,” she said. “Justice has been served and we’re grateful.” Gauteng Community Safety acting head Sipho Thanjekwayo supported the family during the trial. Thanjekwayo said: “This will send a strong message that the justice system will catch up with you if you commit such a horrible act against a woman.”
