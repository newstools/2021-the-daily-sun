KAIZER Chiefs are set to jet out to Morocco today. But their trip hangs in the balance. With hours to go, Amakhosi have not been issued with visas required for entry into the North African country. Amakhosi are scheduled to face off with Wydad Casablanca in their Caf Champions League group C at Mohammed V Stadium Casablanca on Saturday. But they not gain entry into Morocco due to the strict Covid-19 regulations. South Africa is flagged as high risk in terms of the Covid-19 pandemic and visitors from these shores may not be allowed to land in Casablanca. “Following the submission of the application for visas, the club has been in constant communication with Caf, the Moroccan Embassy in SA, South African Embassy in Morocco, Safa, Wydad Casablanca, the Moroccan football association and the Department of International Relations and Corporation (DIRCO) to ensure that the application for visas is processed and approved,” the club said. Wydad did confirm that they are awaiting confirmation from their Ministry of Health to grant Kaizer Chiefs special permission to enter the country because South Africa is on the list of countries that have been banned from entering Morocco due of the high numbers of the Covid-19 infections. No response has been received by Wydad or Kaizer Chiefs to this effect. “Kaizer Chiefs will once again send a delegation to the Moroccan Embassy this morning in an effort to seek clarity and request for the issuing of visas so the team can catch their flight and honour the fixture against Wydad in Casablanca on Saturday.”
