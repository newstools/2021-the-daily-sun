TWO men, who were allegedly arrested for running an illegal laboratory at Barberton Bo Hill last Friday, were granted bail. Nkosinathi Nkosi (24) and Thembeka Maseko (29) appeared before the Barberton Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on Friday, 26 February. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, the two were arrested during a disruptive operation at Barberton on Friday, 19 February, after a tip-off that a suspect was running two semi laboratories, allegedly processing gold bearing materials. “The Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation, Tactical Response Team Pienaar, Forensic Science Laboratory head office Pretoria, Local Criminal Record Centre Nelspruit and SSG Security proceeded to the identified addresses. The suspects were found crushing the gold bearing materials, and two were arrested. Pendukas and other equipment used for gold bearing processing materials were seized,” said Sekgotodi. “The suspects are facing charges of contravening PMD act 37 of 2005 possession, smelting and running an illegal lab. The court heard that accused Maseko had a previous conviction where he was arrested in 2018, and sentenced to a year and six months, wholly suspended for three years. But on their latest arrest, bail was granted at R2 000 each, and the case was postponed to 24 April for further investigation,” Sekgotodi added.
