FIVE days after she was reported missing, Lihlumo Mzini (8) was found dead in Dorchester Heights, East London. Residents are now worried the killer might be someone they know. According to Colonel Sibongile Soci, police arrested her mother three days after Lihlumo went missing. The woman appeared in the East London Magistrates Court for child neglect charges on Monday. But her case was remanded until next month for a bail application. Cambridge cops were called on Tuesday to a scene at Dorchester Heights, where a body had been found. It couldn’t be ascertained at the time whether the body was Lihlumo’s. ISIBAYA ACTRESS ARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER! But the People’s Paper has reliably learnt the naked body was that of Lihlumo. “A murder docket was opened for further investigation. No arrests have been made,” said Soci. Her aunt Nolukholo Smanga said to Daily Sun: “The family met after the discovery of the body and said we shouldn’t speak to the media. “We don’t know if we’ll speak again in future. We don’t want to say anything.” According to community activist Lungelo Ncukuthu, her mother was drinking at home with two unknown men on the night Lihlumo went missing. “It was traumatic that Lihlumo went missing, but the discovery part is devastating,” said Lungelo. “Everyone is shocked. Someone must know something. It can’t be business as usual. We demand justice for Lihlumo.”
