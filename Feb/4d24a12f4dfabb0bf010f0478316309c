 MPUMALANGA police have launched a manhunt for a suspect who fled with a police officer’s firearm. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told Daily Sun the incident happened on Friday, 19 February, while the man was being taken to the Dullstroom Police Station for questioning regarding a murder case. "The investigation officer was busy investigating the murder case in which a 33-years-old woman was killed, and her body was found in a pool of blood at a shack in the early hours of Friday,” he said. “The incident is said to have occurred at Sakhelwe Township near Dullstroom, and during the probe, police needed to ask the said man some questions in relation to the case. Whilst on their way, the man managed to disarm the investigating officer of his pistol before fleeing the scene.” “The member then called for backup where members from Lydenburg K9 responded, but upon arrival, the suspect was already on the run. Police are currently requesting the suspect, whom they believe can be of great assistance in this investigation, to contact the investigating officer as urgently as possible , or anyone who may know of his whereabouts to contact the police as well.” He said a case of common robbery is being investigated and police urge anyone with information that can assist to contact Detective Sergeant Herbert Ntshwane Lerobane on 078 730 2831 or 013 2540 141 or CrimeStop Number 08600 10111.
