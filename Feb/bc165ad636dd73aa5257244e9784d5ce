Raynel Ramdhani said: "I worked for Greyhound as a cabin attendant. I had the best time of my life traveling to different places and gained many experiences of a lifetime and I'm sure many did before and after me. So sad to hear that this once great company is going to be no more and even more heartbroken that, the many friends I have that still work for Greyhound will soon not have jobs. Covid is real and is affecting many families. Our government doesn't care for the ordinary man. Please stop posting horrible things and starting standing up for our future. Bless all. " Andrew Sithole said:" What a sad ending, I took a trip with them back in 2018 to Cape Town and back that was the safest and memorable trip. I'm just worried about what will happen to all the drivers who worked for them. " Mohale Motaung said: “When I was young, my siblings and I would travel to see my grandparents in Kimberley using the Greyhound. Super sad that they’re closing down."
