COCKFIGHTING organisers in Southern India are on the run
after a rooster allegedly killed its owner during a cock fighting event. It is alleged that the owner, 45-year-old, died due to loss
of blood before he could even reach the local hospital. According to Al Jazeera the rooster had a knife fitted on
its leg for the illegal cockfight event. The rooster inflicted wounds on the
owner's groin as it tried to escape. “Satish was hit by
the rooster’s knife in his groin and started bleeding heavily,” police told the
news channel. The rooster was briefly held at the local police station
before it was sent to a poultry farm. “We may need to produce it before the
court,” the cop said. Images of the rooster tied with a rope and pecking grain at
the police station were widely viewed on social media.
