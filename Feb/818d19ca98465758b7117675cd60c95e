RESIDENTS of Phuthaditjhaba in the Free State were pleased with the selfless police constable who rescued a pensioner from a flooded river. Constable Isaac Mabe on Monday, 8 February was leaving home for work when he heard over the radio an elderly woman had been seen in the flooded river. On arrival, Gogo Tlaleng Mahlako (67) was screaming and pleading for help. Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said police found a number of helpless community members gathered over the bridge, listening to the voice asking for help. He said the brave police constable didn’t waste any time and jumped in. “I couldn’t even see her, but I used my amateur swimming skills and made my way through the thorny branches into the muddy river,” said Constable Mabe. “I took a risk and dived into the flooded river until I reached her. I wasn’t afraid of drowning as my focus was on rescuing the granny. I told her I’m here to rescue her. “It was a frightening moment for her. I asked her to take a grip of my belt as I started swimming with her towards the bank of the river.” Daily Sun learned that Mabe is celebrating 10 years as a policeman. Community leader Bigboy Mazibuko welcomed Mabe’s selfless effort. “It’s a great pleasure for us to have such a policeman. I hope his colleagues can learn from him,” he said. “Some of the police officials are the enemies of our people. They’re working hand in glove with the criminals,” The family of Gogo Tlaleng wasn’t available for comment. Police provincial commissioner Lieutenant Baile Motswenyane said the action taken by Mabe was selfless and exceptional.
