KAIZER Chiefs should expect another tough day at the office. That is the message from SuperSport United defender Thatayaone Ditlhokwe ahead of their meeting with the Glamour Boys at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3pm). The Soweto giants’ struggles have been well documented of late following three successive defeats. But Ditlhokwe and his teammates are eager to add to Chiefs’ woes as they look to complete a double over the struggling giants. “We are prepared,” said Ditlhokwe who is raring to go. SuperSport are on a mission of their own to keep the pressure on leaders Mamelodi Sundowns in the title race. They can’t afford to drop points if they are to stop their Tshwane rivals from running away with the title. “We keep taking it one game at a time. I think we are prepared and ready to go and fight against Chiefs. “It was important to have a break because we came from a tough January period where we were playing week in week out. “We did not have much time to rest or prepare enough for our matches so we are glad to have gotten the rest we need and we are now back to winning ways.”
