LIVING to the true definition of the word, Anelisa Ngwane, founder of Embodiment says a woman who embodies her true power is what inspired her to start a beauty driven brand. Embodiment is a brand that sells hair to women who wear their hair as crowns of beauty and confidence.  She chose hair specifically because that is what compliments a women’s brain. Despite competing in a highly competitive market which seldom receives support from fellow women entrepreneurs, Anelisa has also opened a Facebook platform called WEP (Women Embody Power).  WEP seeks to provide support for female entrepreneurs, which is her ultimate passion. Asked if she thinks South Africa is right up there with the world in terms of the hair business, the Embodiment founder reiterated that South Africa is catching up with the world in terms of the level of hair installs. She said women are learning more techniques of how to take care of their hair. With the dream to grow the brand beyond hair, Anelisa believes that true success is fulfilling your true purpose.
