 Hawks have arrested a popular Forex trader on 194 charges ranging from 
fraud, theft, and contravening various financial acts to the tune of 
R735 000. Prince Nkosinathi Mazibuko, 28, is accused of scamming
 people and getting them to invest in his company Born Rich Group (Pty) 
Ltd with the promise of an 80% monthly return. “However, Mazibuko 
never paid the promised monthly returns nor the interest back to the 
complainants. The total value involved is R735 000.00,” said KZN Hawks 
spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo. He faces 194 charges of 
fraud alternatively theft, contravention of  the Bank Act, contravention
 of the Financial Institutions Act, and contravention of the Financial 
Advisory and Intermediary Services Act. Mazibuko is said to have 
lured people in during May 2015 and June 2015 and a case was opened in 
Pietermaritzburg and the case docket was allocated to the Hawks members 
from Pietermaritzburg Serious Commercial Crime Investigation. In 
2017 the Daily Sun reported that Sandton police were on the hunt for 
Mazibuko, who was 23 at the time, after allegations that he had 
defrauded people of millions. Mazibuko made his name as a young 
millionaire who shared his flashy lifestyle on social media. His 
Instagram has since gone private. He is due to appear in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Friday 26 February 2021. News24
