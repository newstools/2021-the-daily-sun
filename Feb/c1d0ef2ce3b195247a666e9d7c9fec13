TAVERN owners in Nyanga, Cape Town, have accused cops of stealing booze worth over R75 000. The cops allegedly took their booze on 30 December, two days after President Cyril Ramaphosa banned sales. One of the owners, Bende Zulu, said she was not home when the booze was taken. But she received a call telling her that cops had taken it. “Cops said they received a tip-off we were selling booze,” said Zulu. “They harassed and searched everybody in the house. “They found keys in the pocket of one of our family members, unlocked the tavern, and took all the alcohol.” She said cops told them they saw someone drinking in a car outside the tavern. Zulu said she met with station commander Brigadier Vuyisile Ncata, who was not aware of the raid. She said Ncata told her the booze was not supposed to have been removed. Velemina Mbatsha, who was present when cops took the booze, said: “I asked them to allow me to count the booze while they loaded it in their vans, but they refused.” Maxwell Ngubeni said the alcohol that was taken away was worth R113 000, but they only recovered booze worth R38 000. “They left with five vans full of booze, but when they brought it back it fitted in only one van,” said Ngubeni. “When we counted there was not even one spirit, but they loaded a lot of them when they left. We made a loss of over R75 000.” Liquor licence consultant Thulani Pike said: “Cops were not supposed to take booze from a licenced tavern. “There was no designated officer who deals with liquor. Ordinary officers are not empowered to remove booze from licenced premises.” Colonel Andre Traut confirmed a case was opened. “This office can confirm that alcohol was indeed confiscated from the tavern during December 2020. “It can also be confirmed that an allegation of theft was made against police. “This theft case is under investigation, and once finalised this office will be in a far better position to offer you a more detailed response.”
