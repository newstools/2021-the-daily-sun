FOLLOWING multiple gunshots around 7pm on Friday night, 12 February, neighbours came to check what had happened. To their shock, they found lawyer Moleko Ratau (58) lying dead in a pool of blood in front of his gate. From Lebowakgomo Zone R, Ratau was allegedly speaking on his cellphone when he was attacked and shot dead at close range. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said when Ratau was on a call, unknown suspects approached. They then allegedly shot him several times, killing him instantly, before disappearing into thin air. “The police and medical emergency personnel were summoned and upon arrival, he was certified dead on the scene. We opened a case of murder and our investigations are underway. A manhunt for the suspects was also launched,” Ngoepe said. The motive behind the killing was still unknown. Ngoepe condemned the incident with the most strongest terms as cops had been instructed by Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba to track down the suspects so they can face the full might of the law. Police are also appealing to anyone with information to contact Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Baloyi on 082 565 8234, Crime Stop at 08600 10111, the nearest police station or MySaps App.
