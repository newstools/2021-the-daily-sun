SEASONED actor Bongani Madondo is on cloud nine. He has joined the cast of SABC1’s soapie Uzalo and plays the role of a gangster for the first time in his 20-year acting career. Bongani, who also play the role of Sifiso Ntuli on Skeem Saam, said he’s excited to play the role of Amos which was previously played by Ernest Msibi, who rose to fame playing Chester on Yizo Yizo. He told SunBuzz that he’s not copying the old Amos. “I’m here to play the character, not the previous actor. The brief about the character guided me how to play my role and be real.

He said Amos is a gangster and pimp. “He steals cars and also sells girls to mafia guys. However, he has grown and progressed to be a mafia.” Bongani said Amos’ character has taught him that crime does not pay, and that’s why Amos is now in a wheelchair after being shot by MaNgcobo, played by Dawn Thandeka King. “Being in a wheelchair is tough and I understand what people who are living with disability are going through. “They must know that they are also human beings and if I had the power, I’d start a campaign to teach people about disabilities,” said Bongani.
