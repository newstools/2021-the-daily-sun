VETERAN actress Moshidi Motshegwa has joined BET drama series, Isono. The award-winning actress was fired from The River two years ago after a scuffle with a fellow actress and one of the executive producers. At the time, she voiced her frustration with how she was allegedly belittled by one of the show’s executive producers, who told her that she was “too expensive”. This was despite the fact that she took home a Mzansi Viewer’s Choice gong for best actress, walking away with R50 000. ALSO READ: WATCH: ‘BLESSER’ BULLDOZES EX’S HOUSE!
