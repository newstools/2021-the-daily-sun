THE streets of Limpopo will be a better place to live in after serial rapist Ramoketse Mokgolobotho’s conviction. He was slapped with three life sentences and an additional 10 years’ imprisonment by the Morebeng Sexual Offences Court. The 38-year-old from Botlokwa was found guilty of threatening and raping four women, aged between 19 and 21 years old. According to evidence given in court during his trial, Mokgolobotho’s reign of terror started in October 2015 in Botlokwa when he broke into a house while two of the victims were asleep. He threatened them with a firearm and raped both of them twice. The serial rapist continued with his terror using the same method. He was ultimately arrested in 2017 when he attacked his last victim, a 21-year-old woman. He broke into her house while she was asleep and alone, applying the same tactics. NPA Limpopo spokeswoman, Mashudu Malabi-Dzangi, said Mokgolobotho was linked through DNA evidence to more than four other rape incidents. “Advocate Norman Makhubele told the court Mokgolobotho is a dangerous man who targeted young women and destroyed their lives. “His actions were well-planned. He wasn’t going to stop if he was not arrested. He’s a danger to the well-being of women and the community must be protected against him.” Malabi-Dzangi said the court agreed with the state that the suspect should be sentenced to three life terms and an additional 10 years’ imprisonment. He was also declared unfit to possess a firearm. Welcoming the heavy sentence, the director of public prosecutions in Limpopo, Advocate Ivy Thenga, said the sentence should be a lesson that violence against women can no longer be tolerated. Thenga commended the police and the prosecutor for their good work.
