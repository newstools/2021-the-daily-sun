PATRICE Motsepe will hand over the chairmanship of Mamelodi Sundowns to his son, Tlhopane, in the event he is elected as the president of Caf. The Sundowns supremo will be vying for the highest position in African football, along with three other candidates, in the 12 March elections in Rabat, Morocco. But the overarching question of a possible conflict of interest had remained unanswered, at least until Motsepe addressed it at the press conference which he had called to unpack his manifesto in Joburg on Thursday. “I don't want to preempt the whole thing. But my son is going to be the chairman, ” said Motsepe referring to the eldest of three sons. “You never count your chickens until they hatch. But you've got to prepare. Dr Rejoice Simelane will be there. His mother and brothers will be there. “They are going to have to make money available for the club. My heart will always be there. “So my jersey as a chairman will be retired. You cannot have a president who is associated with the club and have to play a leadership role. “I've got to be a supporter of all the teams... Orlando Pirates, TP Mazembe, AmaZulu, Kaizer Chiefs. My number one duty is to football and not to individual clubs. “I’ve got to maintain the sense of impartiality and sense of lack of bias.”
