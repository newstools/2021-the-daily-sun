DID you know the stories of Kaizer Motaung Jnr, Matsilele and Bamuza Sono? Well, these three players are the sons of famous football club bosses, Kaizer Motaung of Kaizer Chiefs and Jomo Cosmos supremo, Jomo Sono. Their fathers are former footballers, too, having established their clubs, following stints overseas.  Motaung Jnr and Bamuza are also former professionals while Matsilele is still active, playing for his father’s Ezenkosi in the GladAfrica Championship. But they are not the only ones mixing business with family.  Lungelo Dube, the son of Arrows chair lady Mato Madlala, is also playing for his mom’s team. The 26-year-old midfielder started his football career in the Arrows development structures. He then represented Abafana’ Besthende in the Multichoice Diski Challenge. After impressing in the Diski Challenge, Dube was promoted to the first team along with the likes of Nduduzo Sibiya, Thabani Zuke and many more. Dube has made three appearances in the DStv Diski challenge so far this season. However, he is yet to play the entire match in the league, despite starting on all three occasions.
