THE hike in sin tax is a gift to thugs, according to Tax Justice SA (TJSA). On Wednesday, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni announced an 8% increase for booze and cigarettes when he tabled his budget speech. TJSA founder Yusuf Abramjee said thugs in illicit trade are rejoicing while it is a blow to tax-paying businesses and consumers. He said: “The black market in tobacco and alcohol that exploded as a result of lockdown restrictions is likely to soar further out of control. “The sin tax hike is the worst possible news for hard-up South Africans, who are fed up seeing criminals get rich while their own families go hungry. “It means yet another pay day for the organised crime syndicates that added alcohol and tobacco to their usual portfolio of hard drugs, protection and prostitution over the last year,” said Abramjee. He said the impact of illicit trade will take years to reverse. “Minister Mboweni’s announcement is like a charter for criminals. Higher prices for legal products will only make illicit goods more attractive to consumers and the illegal players will simply grow even stronger.”
