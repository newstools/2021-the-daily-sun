THE madala had a dream in October in which his ancestors showed him a spot in his yard which had money and diamonds. So Stephens Khumalo started to dig and found white rocks. He said his father also had the same dream in the 1980s, but he was too old to make them come true. “My father was shown wealth in the same spot. In the dream, I was also shown a lot of clear stones I believe could be diamonds,” he said. But the 63-year-old from Diepkloof in Soweto had to put the digging on hold and close the 10 metre-deep hole after his neighbours complained it would make their houses sink into the ground.  “We’re not going to allow illegal digging which is going to compromise our houses and our safety,” said a neighbour. They said madala Stephens hired people who used drills to dig, which shook their houses. “We were irritated by the drilling noise of people with crazy dreams. What madness is that?” said another neighbour. The neighbours also allege that a snake came out of the hole and bit a child. But madala Stephens rubbished this allegation. He said his neighbours were jealous and wouldn’t mind their own business. “This is my family yard. I have the right to do whatever I want. This is my home,” he said. “I appeal to anybody or companies with mining expertise to survey my yard to see if my dreams are real.”
