Every few days, the Islanders must couple up those who fail to find a partner with the risk of being dumped from the island. Islanders are on the lookout for romance, but the road to love doesn’t always run smoothly,” read the statement. “Challenges abound with new Islander arrivals and dramatic twists as friendships and relationships form. In addition to choosing their partners wisely, Islanders must also win the hearts of viewers who have the opportunity to shape events on screen and ultimately crown one lucky couple the winners, who will then have the chance to walk away with both love and the cash prize of half a million rand,” it continued. The contestants for this season are being kept as a secret and haven’t been introduced, yet. All will be revealed tonight. Catch Love Island South Africa on M-Net, channel 101 at 8pm, every Sunday.
