KAIZER Chiefs have left Mzansi in a special chartered flight headed to Burkina Faso’s capital Ouagadougou. Amakhosi are set to face Wydad Athletic in a Caf Champions League match at 4 August Stadium on Sunday (6pm SA time). This match was supposed to be played on 13 February, but the Confederation of African Football (Caf) were forced to reschedule it after the Moroccans refused to grant visas to Chiefs‚ citing Covid-19 fears at the reason.  Chiefs began their 2020-21 Caf Champions League group stages with a goalless draw against Guinean side Horoya AC on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Wydad started off their group campaign on the road with a 1-0 win during the week against Petro de Luanda of Angola. ?????? ???? #Amakhosi4Life pic.twitter.com/mBkXx0kLJ3
