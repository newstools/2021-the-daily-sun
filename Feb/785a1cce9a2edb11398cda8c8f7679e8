MASKANDI duo AmaMbeje Amahle are preaching and encouraging unity in the music industry. Working together has made the duo, made up of brothers Mandla “Bhubesi” Mbatha and Sibongiseni “Dlesola” Mbatha, to stay strong in the music industry since 2008. Bhubesi told SunBuzz that nothing could separate them as their managers tried to make them release solo projects in 2010, but they felt they’re good together. “In 2010, we released our solo projects because our managers thought we had grown enough to fly solo. “Solo projects were successful but were not our style. We’re good as a duo” he said. Bhubesi said they’ve been in the music industry for 12 years and it’s easy for them to compose good songs because they spend more time together. “If we’re sitting and a song comes to mind, we sing it together wherever we are. Working with my brother is easy because we are always together and we face everything together. “Two heads are always better than one and we are a good examples of that in the music industry. We started to work together while at school. “Many people always think we are twins because we look alike, but I’m 29 and my brother is 31,” he said.
