FORMER ANC MP Makhosi Khoza says former president Jacob Zuma didn’t respect women in Parliament or in general. Testifying at the Zondo Commission on Thursday, 4 January, she said this was what led to her becoming critical of Zuma. She said she looked at the ANC constitution, which promoted non-sexism and was anti-corruption. “To me, president Zuma was not the embodiment of these values. And I don’t have to talk about the Kwezi saga and how he viewed women and would actually harvest them,” she said. Khoza said she also didn’t like how Zuma had no respect for public money. Khoza said when the EFF presented a vote of no confidence against him in 2017, she decided to vote with her conscience. “We were told no one was allowed to vote in favour of the motion of no confidence. Former ANC chairman Gwede Mantashe said if you voted for it, you would be considered someone who betrayed the ANC,” she said. Khoza said Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula compared those who voted in favour of the motion to suicide bombers. She said on 15 August 2017, Mantashe announced that the ANC’s National Working Committee would commence disciplinary hearings against four ANC MPs, herself included, who admitted to voting against Zuma. Khoza said she was relieved of her duties as portfolio committee on public service and administration chair. She said when she questioned the appointment of Faith Muthambi as communications minister, as she had no qualifications, former finance minister Des van Rooyen told her never to question comrades. Khoza said the ANC failed to transition from being a liberation movement. “Now we’re in a democratic dispensation, where we have to account as the Constitution is calling for transparency,” she said. She said after making her position on Zuma public, she received death threats. “The threats weren’t just directed at me but also at my children. During that same period, certain people came and told my son I killed my husband,” she said, sobbing.
