PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fate will be announced on Monday, 1 March. A probe into Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office was started by Parliament after the DA tabled a motion, granted by Speaker Thandi Modise. Her bid to interdict the process failed in court and Modise appointed a panel of independent judges to look into whether there was enough evidence to probe her. The panel, made up of Justice Bess Nkabinde, Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza and Johan de Waal, has handed its report to Modise, who is set to release it today. Mkhwebane said no one communicated the outcome to her. “My attorney asked after we saw a post on Twitter. They said they would inform me on 1 March.” Mkhwebane has publicly complained about her treatment, accusing Modise’s office of unfairly siding with the DA. Mkhwebane told the SunTeam with it being likely that she would be investigated, she was putting the matter in God’s hands. “This battle is the Lord’s and I still maintain He allowed me to be in this position. We will discuss the way forward with my legal team,” she said. If the panel finds Mkhwebane has a case to answer, President Cyril Ramaphosa could suspend her while the investigation into her fitness to hold office is carried out.
