Hooker for the handicapped is the name given to the controversial scheme in the Netherlands and Denmark that reportedly offers sexual benefits to people living with disabilities. According to reports, people living with disabilities receive payments up to 12 times per year for sexual services from magoshas. The magoshas are called “sexual assistants” and are provided with special training for the visits to people with disabilities who can’t afford to pay themselves. It is claimed this scheme dramatically reduced levels of depression among those living with disabilities as many of them had the chance to explore their sexuality, and have their needs fulfilled. In 2017, a German politician also sparked controversy by suggesting people with severe disabilities could receive “sexual assistance” paid for by the state. The Green party’s spokeswoman for age and care policy, Elisabeth Scharfenberg, cited that the government should provide grants for sexual services to people living with disabilities who can’t achieve satisfaction by any other means. Britain and France are also reported to be considering following suit, offering legal prostitution rings for the use of people living with disabilities.
