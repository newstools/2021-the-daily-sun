THE Sister’s Keeper movement has stood with Tshegofatso Pule’s family from day one. Members attended every court date to support Tshegofatso’s devastated family. They held a silent march on Sunday, 28 February to remember Tshegofatso and her unborn child. The 28-year-old’s body was found hanging from a tree in Roodepoort in June last year. She was eight months pregnant. Movement co-founder Lebogang Moemisi said Tshegofatso wasn’t just a statistic but also a close friend. “It pained me to see Ntuthuko Shoba, the real reason for her death, having the time of his life. “We’d see him drinking and partying ekasi, which brought pain and anger.” Lebogang said the silent walk was to send a message to Shoba’s family, especially one of his relatives who sent a voice note criticising Tshegofatso and claiming Ntuthuko had nothing to do with the murder. Lebogang told the SunTeam it pained her to hear the relative speaking ill of someone who was murdered while carrying a life.  “I asked myself what kind of person is that. Yes, it’s natural to be defensive. But family members don’t always know what their children are doing,” she said. Nine months into the murder case, Shoba (32) was named as the alleged mastermind. It emerged he allegedly paid Muzikayise Malephane R70 000 to murder Tshegofatso to hide the fact that she was pregnant with his child from his wife. Shoba has briefly appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court after. The case was postponed to 1 March for a formal bail application.
