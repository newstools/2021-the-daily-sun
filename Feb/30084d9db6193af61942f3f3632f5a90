MAMELODI Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango has given credit to his teammates for having the best defence in the DStv Premiership this season. Masandawana have conceded only seven goals in the league in 15 matches so far this season. Onyango who have played 14 league matches has kept many as 10 clean sheets and conceded only four goals. The other three goals were conceded by Kennedy Mweene when Sundowns defeated AmaZulu 4-3. Onyango said they managed to keep the clean sheets because of hard work put in by other team members. “We have a lot of clean sheets in the first half and that is the hard work from the guys. It is not only about saving the ball that comes to the goals but it’s the defence that has been good from the team,” Onyango told the club website. "We have our target as you know if you keep many clean sheets you stand a chance to win the league. We look forward to the second round of the league, the Champions League and the Nedbank Cup." The Masandawana number one goalkeeper says they are aiming for more clean sheets as they are targeting a fourth league title in a row. He said: “My target is to get as many clean sheets as I can, help the team with the fourth league title in a row and become the first team to do that as there is no team that has done that.” "It is possible, but I can’t do it alone, we must do it as a team, sometimes I might not play, but there are other goalkeepers that can also help, Onyango continued. "I must also make sure that I support them when they play as it is a team effort. The support I get from the keepers is incredible and it pushes me to do better. "The season is long, we have Champions League and it won’t be easy but it is the path we chose for ourselves and if we fight we will do well and defend our [domestic] titles.”
