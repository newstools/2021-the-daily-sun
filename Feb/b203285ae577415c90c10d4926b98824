THINGS are going well on and off the pitch for AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy. McCarthy, whose team are unbeaten in their last four games, including in the Nedbank Cup last 32, was smiling from ear to ear after Barons Durban surprised him with a brand new Volkswagen T-Roc. The car makers teamed up with Usuthu last year. “Firstly, I just want to send my gratitude and appreciation to Barons Durban for delivering me with a really smart car,” said a beaming McCarthy. “It is a match made in heaven and long may it continue. So, as a football club, as a coach, I’ll always encourage my players so that the performance on the field is fantastic and everybody wins.” McCarthy will keep the car for three to four months before he can swap it with another new set of wheels, emblazoned with his name on the sides. “We have blessed our coach Benni McCarthy with a brand new car from our official vehicle partner,” said AmaZulu head of communications Phumlani Dube. McCarthy has done well since he was appointed as Usuthu coach in December. Under his guidance, Usuthu have won five, lost once and have drawn three games. The former Cape Town City coach was given a mandate by Sandile Zungu to deliver the top four this season. However, McCarthy is on course to do that as Usuthu lie seventh on the table with 21 points from 15 games. McCarthy has vowed that he and players will do everything in their power to bring success to its partners, as the club last won a trophy in 1992 which was the Coca-Cola Cup.
