GOLDEN Arrows’ bright start to the season might be surprising considering there are no big-name players on the side. But coach Mandla Ncikazi says everything is possible when “arrows are pointed in one direction”. Abafana Bes’Thende were on Monday confirmed as the Q2 innovation winners after claiming 16 points in seven games. They won five victories, drew and lost one. They finished ahead of DStv Premiership log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, SuperSport United, AmaZulu FC and Orlando Pirates (all on 12 points) who finished third, fourth and fifth respectively. In claiming this award, they became the first KZN side to win the innovation since it started. Lying fourth in the DStv Premiership table with 28 points after 15 league games, this is also the best points attained by the team halfway through the season. Ncikazi thanked his team for this historical feat. “I’m really proud and honoured to be part of this group,” said Ncikazi who replaced Steve Komphela as the club’s head coach during the off season. “Let this be the motivation to win the next Q-innovation by collecting 12 points from the Limpopo teams.” Arrows will host Black Leopards at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Tuesday (5pm) in what will be a rearranged fixture that was washed off by rain in January. They then host Baroka FC, visit Lidoda Duvha and then host Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. Ncikazi says it is possible to gain 12 points from the four fixtures. “Anything is possible when arrows are pointing in the same direction,” he said. “The most challenging part now is the next matches where the team must maintain consistency and play some matches as favourites and not an underdog. “Our mentality has to be the best in not judging teams according to the log standings. But respect and adapt to their game plans and impose our offensive game after regaining position. “I’m optimistic with such a mentality, the sky is the limit.”
