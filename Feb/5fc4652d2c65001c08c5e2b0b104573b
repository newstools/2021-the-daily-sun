KZN Provincial Executive Committee member Nonhle Mkhulisi (56) died in the early hours of Thursday, 4 February. Mkhulisi was admitted to hospital at the end December last year. She led the fight against the coronavirus until her last breath. Mkhulisi was the former ANC and ANCWL chairwoman in the Musa Dladla region. She was also the current chairwoman of the South African Local Government Association in KZN. According to the ruling party, Mkhulisi was not only a highly respected woman, but also held a position of great seniority in the community. She served as the mayor of the King Cetshwayo District Municipality since 2016 until her demise. The party said she served the ANC, the people of this province and the country with diligence. ANC KZN spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela confirmed the news. Ntombela said Nonhle has certainly left a huge void that will be hard to fill in her family and the ANC as her second home. “We can only offer the Mkhulisi family our heartfelt condolences. Comrade Mkhulisi was one of the most dedicated humble yet combat-ready political leaders who stood firm in her convictions. This is a huge loss for the ANC and communities she worked with,” said Ntombela. He said Mkhulisi championed the cause of the working class during her time as an NEC member of the South African National Democratic Teachers’ Union.
