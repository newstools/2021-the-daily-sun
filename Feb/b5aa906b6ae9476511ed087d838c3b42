MAMELODI Sundowns coach, Manqoba Mngqithi, is crossing his fingers that Denis Onyango recovers in time for their next African Champions League clash against DR Congo powerhouse, TP Mazembe, at the State TP Mazembe inÂ Lubumbashi on Saturday. Onyango got injured in their 5-1 drubbing of CR Beloizdad in their second CAF Champions League Group B match at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium on Sunday. Themba Zwane scored a brace while Peter Shalulile, Lebohang Maboe and Kermit Erasmus all bagged a goal each to hand Downs a convincing win over Belouizdad. Mngqithi said he was concerned but calmed his nerves when Onyango walked after their game. "We don't think it's a serious injury because it's just a bruise," said Mngqithi. "They stomped on him and twisted an ankle. We just hope that, because we'll have a little bit of days before the next match, he will be able to help us. "When I saw him walking on the pitch, I felt a bit better. We're hopeful that he will be back soon. But one must say that Kennedy (Mweene) came back with his experience and plugged the goal, and we never looked shaky." Full-time in Dar es Salaam! A commanding performance with 5?? goals from the boys sees us walk away with all 3?? points!CR Belouizdad (44' Sayoud) 1???5??
