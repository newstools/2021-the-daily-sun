ALMOST all sportsmen and women have their favourite shoes/boots or sneakers that they wear for the big game. The reasons vary from comfort to performance and even luck. The point is: what they wear allows them to perform at their best. And, the same can be said about condoms. According to sex therapist Ian Kerner, the reason you might not want to wear a condom during sex is the issue of comfort. She advises that you invest in a condom that suits your sexual needs.
