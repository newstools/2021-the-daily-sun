LAST week, gogo Emily Phalafala (57) watched from her window as water flooded her house, and continued rising. She asked her neighbours for help and together, they dug a huge trench to divert the water away from her house in Sutelong, North West. The rain stopped and her house was saved – but the trench is still there! Cars cannot pass and she is worried that kids will get hurt. “I want the trench closed, but what if it rains again? Where will I get the strength to dig again?” She said she reported the problem to her councillor. “They must make a way to divert the water from our houses. We experience this problem every year. They need to come up with a permanent solution,” she said. The gogo said that her old house may have collapsed due to flooding. “I can’t afford to start all over again. I’m getting old. I need to sleep like a baby when it rains, but instead I’m up all night watching the rising water levels.” Resident Olga Mosoeu (43) said the councillors and municipality were waiting instead of acting. “Do they want a house to collapse before they install a drainage system?” she asked. She said their solution lay in the coming municipal elections. “We need new people who will know they are in office for the people, not to enrich themselves and their friends,” she added. Councillor Makena Mosetlhe said the Moretele Municipality had a programme to help people affected by floods. He said a list of affected residents and damaged infrastructure had been compiled and would be assisted.
