THE families of the three Lily Mine workers who remain buried underground gathered near the site of the tragedy to remember their loved ones on Friday, 5 February in Louisville, Mpumalanga. Pretty Nkambule, Yvonne Mnisi and Solomon Nyirenda were trapped after a container they were in collapsed five years ago. The families told Daily Sun that they felt neglected by the government. Fiona Nyirenda appealed to the government to help them find closure. “I will only have peace the day I take my child home. Our house feels empty without him; seeing his room without him is painful. Today I am on chronic medication because of the government that keeps on failing us; it breaks my heart,” she said. Lomvimbi Mavuso said every time the day of the tragedy came, her heart broke because the government had made it clear that it was not willing to help. “I don’t know what our children did to deserve this kind of treatment. We have seen other countries experiencing similar incidents but managing to rescue everyone. Why can’t it happen to our loved ones?” asked Mavuso. Director of Arqomanzi Neil Herrick, which is the leading bidder on the list of business rescue practitioners, said the company met all the requirements that the business rescue practitioners had put in front of them. “Our intention is to reopen the Lily and Barbrook mines. We have committed to the practitioners, affected people and creditors that our intention is to make a genuine effort to recover the three missing workers. We will try to locate the container and workers,” he said. “The message I’m giving them is that we are still here, and not going away. We have the money, and we are willing to get this process moving forward. It must be a terrible feeling for the families to still not have closure five years later,” he added.
