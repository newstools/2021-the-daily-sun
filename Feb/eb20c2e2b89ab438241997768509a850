ORLANO Pirates have booked their spot in the CAF Confederation Cup group stages after a 4-0 win on aggregate over Jwaneng Galaxy in the play-off round. The Buccaneers won the first leg 3-0 away in Botswana last weekend. On Sunday they sealed the deal with a 1-0 victory in a match that was played at Orlando Stadium in Soweto. Linda Mntambo scored the only goal of the encounter in the second half of the match. Coach Josef Zinnbauer made nine changes to the starting line-up which faced Galaxy in Gaborone with Mntambo and Thulani Hlatshwayo being the two players, who retained their places in the team. Galaxy were hoping to cause an upset by overturning the 3-0 deficit against Pirates side and advance to the group stage. The visitors were the better side in the early exchanges but they couldn't crack Pirates defence which was marshalled by Hlatshwayo. Pirates will now shift their focus to the DStv Premiership as they face SuperSport United on Wednesday.
