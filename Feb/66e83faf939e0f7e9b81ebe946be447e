HARSH weather conditions continue to wreak havoc in KZN. The latest incident took place in Maphumulo, northern KZN, on Wednesday. A six-year-old girl was killed. Enama Ntuli (6) from ePlangweni area was struck by lightning when she went to fetch soap from her yard. Her gogo, Ntombizodwa Madiba (55), said: “Even though we noticed the weather had started changing, we never thought it was going to get so bad that someone would be struck by a lightning.” She said Enama, who was in grade 2 at Nsongansonga Primary School, was about to wash her school socks when she met her death. “Because we were aware she’d gone out only to pick up the soap, we easily noticed that something was not right when she took long to come back,” said Ntombizodwa. “One family member went outside to check on her, only to find her lying unresponsive on the ground.” She said she called out to her and shook her, but she was not responding. “She was certified dead on the scene,” she said. Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka expressed his concern about the loss of life the province continued to witness as a result of harsh weather conditions. He sent his condolences to the Manqele family and directed disaster management teams to provide support to them. He revealed that according to statistics, the 11 people had died in the province since the heavy storms struck on 24 January. Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. She said an inquest docket has been opened at Maphumulo cop shop.
