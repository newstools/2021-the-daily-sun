CHIPPA United striker Bienvenu Eva Nga says he is disappointed with his poor scoring rate since he joined the club. Eva Nga joined The Chilli Boys from Bidvest Wits after the sale of the club. At Chilli Boys, the Cameroonian striker has not made much of an impact and that bothers him. “I am a striker I am supposed to score goals, I feel disappointed because it’s not easy,” said Eva Nga. “But I am happy that when I don’t score, I assist which is part of the game and it means I am contributing.” The 27-year-old only has three goals on his name thus far this season. A hat-trick that he scored on his Chippa debut where they defeated Maritzburg United 3-1. On Sunday he will be hoping to find his scoring form when they face Free State Stars in the Nedbank Cup last-32 at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium (3pm). He said: “The Nedbank Cup is a big cup here in South Africa.“Imagine if Chippa were to win it. It would mean we play (CAF) Confederation Cup next season which would be a good experience for us to face other teams from the continent,” he added. “That would be a good challenge for us, just like Bloemfontein Celtic who experienced Africa this season."
