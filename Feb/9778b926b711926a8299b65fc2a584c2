ASTRAZeneca may not be effective for the current Covid-19 variant, but it is not from the devil. During the vaccine update on Monday, 8 February, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said none of the vaccines that are around are from the devil. He was responding to a question on whether AstraZeneca is not effective against the 501Y.V2 variant because of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng’s prayer against vaccines from the devil. BENEFITS OF WEARING A G-STRING! “I did listen to the chief justice talking about the vaccine from the devil. I must say that I think in a particular language you can say so, but as far as I’m concerned, none of these vaccines are coming from the devil. “Secondly I didn’t hear him calling AstraZeneca as such, but I also believe that we serve one God and all of us as people, whether we are in London or in South Africa, there wouldn’t be a difference in a way God would look at us.” Mkhize said the prayer by the chief justice was a religious expression to assure people that if there was anything that might be wrong, they would receive protection from God. WORKER BUYS COVID SALIVA TO KILL BOSS! “AstraZeneca is not shown to be dangerous, it is not dangerous, the issue is it is not effective against the new variant, and we need more information on that.” In December last year, when the talks of procurement of vaccines were advancing, the chief justice prayed that any vacancies that are from the devil should be burnt and not reach the arms of South Africa. In his prayer at Tembisa Hospital, Mogoeng said, “If there is any vaccine that is from the devil, meant to infuse 666 in the lives of the people, meant to corrupt their DNA, any such vaccine, Lord almighty may it be destroyed by fire”.
