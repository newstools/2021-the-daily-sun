POLICE in Mpumalanga have launched a manhunt for four suspects who shot and killed four family members before setting them alight. The horrific incident happened at Madras and Mandela Village in Bushbuckridge on Wednesday, 16 June. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said that cops received information about a shooting incident at Madras, where four family members were shot in execution style by four suspects inside their RDP house. “Upon arrival at the scene, they found the house in flames with four victims inside lying unconscious with burn wounds in two separate rooms,” said Hlathi. He said emergency services were called and all the victims were certified dead. “The victims have already been identified by the family as the mother Martha Ndlovu (53), the father Eckson Ndlovu (59), their daughter Lovenecia Ndlovu (14) and daughter Permission Ndlovu (12),” said Hlathi. In a separate incident, a group of about four armed suspects stormed into a house at Mandela Village in Bushbuckridge. “It is said that Caswell Maphanga (25) was asleep at the time and the suspects reportedly shot at him and then burned the house before they fled the scene,” he said. Maphanga was certified dead by the paramedics and a murder case was opened. “A preliminary investigation revealed that the killing spree is as a result of gangs fighting against each other. “We want to urge the community to help police in finding these heartless villains,” he said. Hlathi said they were looking for two men, Skumbuzo Madalane and Bonginkosi Shakoane, to assist them with the investigation.
