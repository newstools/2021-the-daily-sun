AMAZULU midfielder, Msindisi Ndlovu, says it was no surprise that they won the DStv Diski Challenge Rewired without defeat. Usuthu won the title on Sunday after beating Mamelodi Sundowns 2-0 in the final played at FNB Stadium. Ndlovu was one of the instrumental players in the AmaZulu team. His hard work saw him being voted Man of the Match in the semi-final and final. Talking to SunSport yesterday, Ndlovu said: “We had put in a lot of work before the season starts. “Of course we knew it was not going to be easy, but with the work we put in, it was no surprise that we played nine games without defeat.” In seven stream matches, AmaZulu won four and drew three times to accumulate 15 points, which saw them top Stream One and qualify for the semi-finals. In the last four, they eliminated Kaizer Chiefs 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in regular time. Usuthu always had the ability to come from behind and win matches. They came from behind on three occasions. Ndlovu explained: “To us, a draw felt like defeat. I remember against Chippa United, we came from 2-0 down to win the match 3-2. We scored our goals in the last 30 minutes of the game. “Against SuperSport United, we came from behind and again against Chiefs in the semi-final.” Like most of the lads playing in the Diski Challenge, Ndlovu and his teammates dreamt of playing in the first team. However, he said that should come on merit, and they will not put unnecessary pressure on themselves because that might affect their performances.
