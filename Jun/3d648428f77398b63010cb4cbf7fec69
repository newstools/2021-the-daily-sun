MUVHANGO stars have appealed to fans not to ask them to take off their masks for pictures and to keep their masks on. They said they’re also human beings who’re afraid of being exposed to Covid-19. In a video posted by Dingaan Mokebe on Instagram, Zonke Mchunu and Maumela Mahuwa share their experiences when fans approached them for pictures, asking them to take off their masks. “We do what we do for you, but you have to understand that we have families and there’s a pandemic out there,” he said. “Are we not human beings? Why when I walk into a shop that’s written no mask no entry am I expected to take off my mask?” ALSO READ : SKEEM SAAM FANS HAPPY FOR LESHOLE! Zonke Mchunu, who plays Imani on the SABC2 soapie, echoed his sentiments, saying that although they love fans, they needed to show some respect because there’s a pandemic that’s killing people. “Let’s respect each other. We can’t take pictures with 3 000 people who’re not wearing masks. We love you, our fans, but don’t endanger our lives,” she said. Maumela, better known as Susan on the show, said fans asked her to take pictures without her masks on so that other people would believe they indeed took pictures with her. “We’re also human beings and need to protect ourselves. Taking pictures with fans is not an issue, but we need to be responsible while doing it,” said the actress. Shared post on Time History of Christianity - dardarkom Full Episodes and Clips
