KAIZER Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung has taken what could be read as a thinly-veiled swipe at Gavin Hunt for the philosophy Amakhosi couldn't fulfil. Hunt was sacked last Friday for a string of poor results, which has now left the Glamour Boys to fend off relegation threat. “We felt that there was a need to bring in someone of his stature to preserve our culture and philosophy. With the way we’re playing lately, you could see we have lost something in the team that is very critical,” said Motaung, when explaining the appointment of the club’s new head of technical and youth academy. Apart from results, Hunt was often criticised for the type of football Amakhosi were playing under his guidance. Motaung continued: “Molefi comes at the right time as we implement changes we believe are necessary for the club as we go into the future. “We strongly believe we have appointed the right person for the position as he is someone who has worked at all stages of football, from school level to youth structures and all our national teams."
