THE memorial service for Motsweding FM’s Boitumelo Moetsi, who was best known as Mmamane Tumi or Rakgadi wa bana, took place today, 10 June. Due to Covid-19 regulations, the memorial service was broadcast virtually for those who could not make it because of the restrictions. She worked as an SABC education children’s programme presenter and producer, including the well-known Motsweding FM Sunday School programme. Tumi died last weekend due to Covid-19 related complications, according to the SABC and family spokesman Dede Letsoge. Letsoge also confirmed that the presenter would be laid to rest on Saturday, 12 June. The funeral service will be held at Mmabatho Convention Centre. He said they’ve also made provisions for those who won’t be able to attend the funeral service due to limited numbers. “We have invited 100 people and we are not going to allow anybody who has not confirmed to attend the funeral. However, we have made provisions for a virtual funeral for those who will not be able to attend the service.” ALSO READ | RHYTHM CITY REPLACEMENT ANNOUNCED!
