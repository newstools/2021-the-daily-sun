THE DA has demanded that Home Affairs confirm allegations that Shepherd and Mary Bushiri may have travelled back to South Africa. This comes after news reports over the weekend which alleged the fugitives may have travelled to Mzansi on multiple occasions. DA shadow minister of Home Affairs, Angel Khanyile, said it was about time Minister Aaron Motsoaledi updated Parliament on the progress of investigations into how the Bushiris managed to escape the country. They faced charges of fraud, money laundering and theft of more than R102 million! “We also require an update regarding the progress government has made in regard to the extradition proceedings of the Bushiris, which was reportedly started in November 2020,” said Khanyile.

It was embarrassing that the Hawks had allegedly managed to let the Bushiris slip through their net on their second visit to the country since fleeing the country. “The Hawks are supposed to be the cream of the South African Police Service crop, yet the Bushiris reportedly escaped in an unsearched Uber,” she said. “If this is the best South Africa can expect, it’s no wonder that all manner of corrupt individuals have made the country its playground.”
