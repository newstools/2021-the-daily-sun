CITY Power workers, Joburg Metro cops and Prasa set out on a mission to cut izinyoka in squatter camps in Mayfair and Brixton. But residents were not having it. They retaliated by forming a human shield and threatened police. Speaking to Daily Sun, community leader France Makalela (45) said it pained him that black people cut off their electricity. “These are our brothers and they know life is tough in such places. “I’m surprised they looked so confident knowing they’ll be leaving us in darkness.  “None of us want to live in this place, under such conditions, but we have no choice.” He said the area was full of foreign nationals, claiming they didn’t have title deeds. “But if I attempt to hijack a house I’ll die or end up in prison,” said France. Resident Ditiro Kaoela (29) from Slovo Park squatter camp said: “None of the promises made have been delivered in the 15 years I’ve lived here. Things became worse when new councillors were elected. The housing project just stopped. We’re forced to connect power illegally as many shacks burn when we make fires,” he said. Ditiro said women, kids and the elderly wouldn’t survive in the cold.  “There’s a lot going on here, but unfortunately no one wants to listen to us. They harass us because we have nothing,” he said. City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said the operation was a success even though some people resisted. They targeted illegal connections and metre bypassing by formal houses and businesses, as well as vandalism which cost the city millions.
