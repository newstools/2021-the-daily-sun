DRIP Footwear, owned by businessman Lekau Sehoana on Tuesday, 8 June, signed an equity partnership deal with Cassper Nyovest. The motswako rapper, whose real name’s Refiloe Phoolo, revealed that the partnership signed at an exclusive press conference at The Leonardo Hotel in Sandton is worth about R100 million. “This is what dreams are made of. It’s moments like these that redefine history. A shift of power. A milestone for me and South African Culture. This also sends a strong message out so say, as much as you can do great things on your own, 2 great black minds are always better than one. Another one for black excellence,” he said.

With consistency and faith, they too can reach these heights, no matter which dusty streets they’re from,” said Sehoana. Cassper has been attending most of Drip Footwear store launches. So far, the brand that was launched just under two years ago, opened its 12th store in the Vaal on Saturday, 5 June.
