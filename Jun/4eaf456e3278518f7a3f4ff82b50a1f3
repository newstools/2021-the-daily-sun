Two men who killed two brothers in a revenge attack after a squabble over alcohol were each sentenced to an effective 25 years by the Mpumalanga High Court in Mbombela. Chris Ntimane, 28, and Eugine Lubisi, 29, were sentenced on Friday. They stood trial for the murder of two brothers, Ally Goodman, 24, and Simon Mahlalela, 31, at Mashonamini Trust in Calcutta near Hazyview in June 2019. According to police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the killers followed the brothers after an earlier altercation at a local tavern. "It is said that the Mahlalela siblings and the two accused were at a certain tavern at Calcutta when an argument ensued over alcoholic beverages. The squabble led to the victims leaving the tavern with two other friends and headed home, but Ntimane and Lubisi – who wanted to settle a score – stalked them to persist with the earlier altercation," Hlathi said. "A serious fight then broke out between the victims and the accused, but the Mahlalelas' friends managed to flee. The fight ended badly as the victims sustained serious injuries. When the accused realised the consequences of their act, they fled the scene, leaving the victims helpless," Hlathi said. The siblings' bodies were found in pools of blood. They had multiple stab wounds and were certified dead by paramedics. An investigation ensued, and Ntimane – accompanied by a relative – handed himself over to the police while Lubisi went on the run. He was finally traced when he went to a hospital to seek treatment for injuries he sustained in the fight. The court handed them 25-year sentences for each count of murder, which will run concurrently.
