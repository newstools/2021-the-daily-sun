NEWLY appointed Kaizer Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter is on a mission to discover something that will give his side an advantage to end their six-year trophy drought. Baxter made this statement on Wednesday as he returns for his second spell having signed a two-year contract with an option for another two years. The former Bafana Bafana coach replaced Gavin Hunt, who was sacked last month with two league games remaining after a string of poor results that saw Chiefs sneak into the top eight on the last day. Baxter will work with Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard as his assistants, while Molefi Ntseki is head of technical and youth development academy. The 67-year-old Baxter will start his duties by guiding Chiefs in the Caf Champions League semi-final first leg clash against Moroccan side Wydad Atletic away next Saturday. Said Baxter: “I think the league has improved considering bottom teams are no push overs now. It will be different. The game has moved forward and has changed than when I came last time. I’ve got to find out what’s new and what can I use that will bring us advantage. It will be an interesting challenge.” Baxter, who helped Amakhosi to win the league in 2012 and 2015, said having a playing identity will be vital to reclaim the past glory. “When I came here the last time, Chiefs had not won a trophy for quiet a while, so when I came in I knew winning something was a priority for them,” he said. “But I didn’t look only at winning trophies. I was trying to build the team, bond with supporters, and help find the identity. That was an interesting part and that would be the same again now.” Baxter already has a plan to overcome Wydad and ensure Chiefs build a solid foundation for the new season. “I’ve got to try identify a couple of things, maybe tactically for this games. It’s strong opponent, but we have shown in the home game that we can match them.” Baxter revealed that he will do whatever it takes to please the Amakhosi fans.
