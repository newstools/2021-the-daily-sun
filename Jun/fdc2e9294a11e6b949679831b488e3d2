Richards Bay came back to hold Chippa United to a 1-1 draw in the PSL promotion/relegation playoffs match at the Umhlathuze Sports Complex Grounds on Saturday afternoon. The draw saw the Natal Rich Boys remain second on the playoffs standings, while the Chilli Boys also remained at the top of the standings with one game left for each. Both teams adopted a cautious approach and there was little to choose between the two sides in the opening proceedings, with the Chilli Boys edging the possession stakes. The Natal Rich Boys upped the tempo after the half-hour mark, with Somila Ntsundwana looking to use his imposing physique and aerial prowess to unsettle the Chilli Boys' defence. The Richards Bay striker connected with a quality cross from Katlego Maphathe in the 43rd minute, but his header went straight into goalkeeper Ismail Watenga's hands. At the other end, Bienvenu Eva Nga forced keeper Malcolm Jacobs into a comfortable save with a low shot from range, and the score was 0-0 at the interval. The Chilli Boys controlled the match after the restart and they broke the deadlock when Peter Maloisane scored with a calm finish to hand Chippa a 1-0 lead in the 56th minute after being set-up by Maloisane Mokhele. The hosts tried to level matters seven minutes later, but Khanyiso Mayo's tame shot was easily saved by Uganda's new No 1 keeper Watenga, who was well-positioned in the goal-posts. However, parity was restored in the 73rd minute when Siyabonga Vilane hit the back of the net with a header after the Chippa defence was exposed and Tshepo Mabua grabbed a well-deserved assist. The Natal Rich Boys did not sit back after equalising as they continued to attack, and Vilane's header which was meant for Ntsundwana was gathered by Watenga with 13 minutes left. The last real chance of the match fell for Augustine Chidi Kwem after he turned very well in the box in the 86th minute, but the Chippa striker fired wide of the target and, ultimately, the game ended in a 1-1 draw.
