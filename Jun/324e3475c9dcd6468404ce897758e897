SISANDA Qwabe-Coutaud gives hope to disadvantaged communities through gardening. The 31-year-old, who is originally from KZN but now lives in Gauteng, recently donated 3 000 vegetable seedlings to her former primary school in Kwazibi, the Kwazibi Women’s Forum and her village headman Mabudu Tembe. Sisanda said she started a project called Garden of Hope to fight hunger in poor communities. “This is also to honour my late mother, Fikile Mthembu, who loved giving and helping people. My mum had nothing but she took care of many kids, some of who were the victims of floods in Mozambique. She raised them. Even though she was unemployed, we never went to bed hungry.” Sisanda said her mum grew all sorts of food throughout the year. The family ate some of the food and sold most of it. She said the reason she chose the three organisations to donate to was because she knew it would reach many families. “We plant gardens at schools under the One School, One Garden drive. I chose the women’s organisation because it helps a lot of unemployed women. We started this project to remind them they can be an active part of economic development. They can participate in building strong food security for our country,” she said. Sisanda said the project was not only to grow vegetables to eat, but also to start businesses selling them. She said she partnered with organisations such as Africa Grain and Seed, Galaxy Forest Lodge, Mpumalanga Broadcasting Television, SabiPax and the Al-Imdaad Foundation, which committed to buying vegetables from beneficiaries. “These farmers already have a market to sell their products. We must also mention that we didn’t only donate seedlings, we also handed over sanitary packs for girls, school bags with stationery, warm hats, blankets, walking sticks for the elderly, masks and sanitisers. This was made possible by the organisations that partnered with me,” she said. Sisanda said her organisation aimed to plant 100 school gardens per year.
