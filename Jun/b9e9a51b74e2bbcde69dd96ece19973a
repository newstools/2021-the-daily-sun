CEDRIC Sithole (35) was sentenced to six years imprisonment by the Mhala Regional Court on Friday, 25 June. Previously, Sithole had pleaded guilty on both counts of attempted murder on his ex-lover Shongi Chiloane (33), as well as assaulting her 14-year-old child with intent to do grievous bodily harm, after she tried to save her mum. State prosecutor Kedibone Bareng said the state was satisfied with the presentence and victim impact reports from social workers. “The accused assaulted both victims with a broken bottle. He entered their RDP through a window in Dingleydale outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on 16 November at 12am. The victims were sleeping at the time,” said Bareng. His lawyer Peter Malibe told the court that his client was remorseful and pleaded guilty during his previous appearance after his arrest on 15 January. “My client and his ex-lover had an argument that ended with him stabbing her. The accused acknowledged responsibility of assault to the victims. After the incident, the accused sent a delegation to the victims’ family to apologise as he committed the offences under the influence of alcohol,” said Malibe. Magistrate Elmarie Theron said the accused pleaded guilty and showed remorse. “You stabbed both victims with a broken bottle, the victim’s mum several times in the face, neck and lower body before stabbing the child. But she managed to escape and alert family members. Before the incident, the accused left for the toilet but when you returned, she had locked the door. Instead of going away, you forced entry into the house. You intended to kill her.” Sithole was found guilty and sentenced to eight years imprisonment, and two suspended on count one. He was also sentenced to one-year imprisonment on count two for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, which will run concurrently with the six-year sentence. He was declared unfit to possess a firearm and work closely with kids.
