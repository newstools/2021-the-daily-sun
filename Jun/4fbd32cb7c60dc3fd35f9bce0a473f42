SANGO Xamlashe, Kabelo Mokoena and Mhleli Dlamini are some of the newbies who represent the next generation of rugby superstars at the Blue Bulls. Add returnee prop Simphiwe Matanzima, rookies Uzile Tele and Sebastiaan Jobb to that list and you then have the Bulls ticking the transformation boxes with potential Springboks stars. These are some of the emerging players, including Henco Beukes, JJ Scheepers and Johan Mulder, who are seizing their opportunities at Loftus Versfeld. The Bulls haven’t had the best start to their Carling Currie Cup after they lost to Western Province last week. But it was a relatively inexperienced Bulls team, whose senior players, 28, could not be considered as they were in Italy for the Rainbow Cup final. But the youngsters acquitted themselves well and will rightly fancy themselves for more playing opportunities, starting with their home clash against the Pumas at Loftus tonight (7pm). Elsewhere, the Free State Cheetahs will kick off their campaign against the Griquas in Kimberley tomorrow (1pm). Western Province lost to the Lions in midweek. They will have two games at home before they could go into the bubble (ahead of the tour game against the British and Irish Lions at the Cape Town Stadium on 17 July) and they will have a lot of guys like JD Schickerling, Salmaan Moerat, Edwill van der Merwe and Leolin Zas returning. “We’ve now played at Loftus and Ellis Park and have those games out of the way and most would agree they are among the most difficult away venues,” said Province coach John Dobson. “The worst is behind us in terms of being down on team strength, and we have seven points from two games so I think we will be okay.”
