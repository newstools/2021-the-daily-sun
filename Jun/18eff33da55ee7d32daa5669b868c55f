EMPLOYMENT statistics for the first quarter of 2021 show that total employment decreased from 9 653 000 in December 2020 to 9 644 000 in March. Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke said the sectors that shed the most jobs were trade, business, construction and electricity. The bad news led to unemployed South Africans losing hope. Sihle Mashimbye (25) from Mamelodi in Tshwane said she was looking for work but was demotivated. She said if the employment rate went down, then her chances of getting a job were low. “It’s bad that there are not enough jobs for the youth. I’ve been looking for a job for the past five years without any luck, and hearing this is demotivating,” she said. “I just want to work, even if it’s not related to the administration course I studied. We want government to create jobs.” Amos Dabengwa (45), also from Mamelodi, said he’d been looking for a job since 2009. “I hope government will create more jobs so we can work and feed our families.” Maluleke said there was a glimmer of hope as there had been a 1,7% increase in employment in community and social services, 1,1% in mining and 0,4% in manufacturing. “Total employment decreased by 552 000 year-on-year between March 2020 and March 2021,” he said, adding there was no change in full-time employment in transport. Maluleke said part-time employment had increased by 4,6%. “Total gross earnings paid to employees decreased by R26,8 billion from R742,1 billion in December 2020 to R715,3 billion in March. “The basic salary paid to employees decreased by R4,1 billion from R651,2 billion in December 2020 to R647,2 billion in March. “This was largely due to decreases in business services, manufacturing, construction, transport and electricity.”
