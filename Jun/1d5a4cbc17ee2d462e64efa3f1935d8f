SCIENTISTS predict that the third coronavirus wave we’re experiencing will be more brutal than the devastating first and second waves. In Gauteng alone, the peak of the third wave is expected at the end of June and first week of July. The virus is travelling faster than the speed of a racing car, chasing South Africans who’re travelling at a speed of a bicycle when it comes to our vaccination programme. Since the beginning of our programme in February, it’s been littered with various problems – from ordering expired vaccines to having to pull off two million jabs due to contamination issues. The registration of the elderly was chaotic as the SMS alert system didn’t work effectively, and getting old people to register online was not practical. Now we’ve opted for walk-ins. South Africa now stands at number 23 on the continent for our extremely pathetic vaccine efforts. Poorer countries including Zimbabwe, Sao Tome, Equatorial Guinea and Botswana shine in the top 10 for their valiant vaccine roll-out efforts. Our snail-paced roll-out has demonstrated the ANC-led government’s gross incompetence. Hospitals are heaving under pressure as beds and oxygen tanks are running out in Gauteng. After the first and second wave, the state should’ve been better prepared for the third wave. The heartless money monsters stole the moolah as various corruption scandals around procuring services and resources for the pandemic demonstrates. Once again, we’re digging up graves to bury people who shouldn’t die as a result of government corruption and incompetence. The increasing death toll represents our loved ones. Do yourself a favour: don’t bet your life on this government. For you and your family to survive Covid-19, it’s all in your hands. – Editor
