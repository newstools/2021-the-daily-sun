KAIZER Chiefs announced the appointment of Molefi Ntseki ahead of the new season as their head of technical and youth development academy, confirming SunSport’s story. The contract, which starts today, will see him at Chiefs for an initial period of three years, with a two-year option. The new appointment comes as Amakhosi look to further strengthen the institution’s technical operations of building teams that will compete strongly at all levels. “We are delighted to have Molefi at Chiefs,” said Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung. “Molefi comes at the right time as we implement changes that we believe are necessary for the club as we go into the future. “We strongly believe that we have appointed the right person for the position as he is someone who has worked at all stages of football, from school level, youth structures and all our national teams.” The club will today confirm Stuart Baxter as their coach to replace axed Gavin Hunt. Baxter is expected in the country today. Ntseki will have the responsibility of advising on all technical operations and developing the strategy for the senior team, Kaizer Chiefs Youth Development Academy and the reserves. The Free State-born tactician is not new to Chiefs as he has worked with members of the Amakhosi’s technical team during his time with Bafana Bafana as a head coach. He worked with assistant coach Arthur Zwane, goalkeeper coach Lee Baxter and analyst Mark Davy, who worked with him during a number of international matches. At Chiefs, the 51-year-old Ntseki will work with all the members of the senior team and also oversee the academy and scouting department. His role will help with maintaining the link between the academy and the first team and ensure that they are aligned with the Chiefs values, ethos and traditions.
