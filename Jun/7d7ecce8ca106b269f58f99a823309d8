GAVIN Hunt has shot down reports linking him with a move to Zambian side Zanaco. According to reports, the ex-Kaizer Chiefs coach has signed with the Zambian football giants and he was expected to land in Lusaka on Tuesday, local media agency Zamfoot reporting thus “Yes, it’s a done deal. He is arriving in the country today and he will meet with the board.” However, Hunt has denied he was joining Zanaco, saying he has not been approached by anyone, certainly not outside of the borders. “Zambia? I’m only thinking of a holiday in Zanzibar and not Zambia,” said Hunt, in jest yesterday. “But seriously, this is the first time I’m hearing of this. I can’t comment on whether I’d accept such an offer or not. But yes, I want to start working again. Football is my life, you know. I can’t be away from the game. “I’ve taken time out. I’ve been doing some TV work, but I’m itching to get back to the field.” Hunt has been without a club since being axed by Amakhosi. Zanaco are without a permanent coach since they put Chris Kaunda on administrative leave following a string of poor results. The Zambian giants finished as runners-up to rivals ZESCO United last season and they have targeted Hunt for the new season.
