GROWING up, one of the chores I used to hate was fluffing the pillows. Every single morning, I had to fluff all the pillows and cushions in the house. Quite frankly, I never understood the fuss other than me hitting the pillows and cushions into shape. I was told it ensured that they remained soft and comfortable. Now, the same thing can be said about keeping our bums soft. Everyone wants to enjoy a safe and comfortable landing with a soft behind, allowing the best of both worlds. According to sexologists, everyone enjoys a soft and sexy bum during sex, which is also great for your confidence in the bedroom. But, just how do we achieve this soft landing? According to popxo.com, here are some natural ways of achieving a soft and sexy behind: 1. Invest in bump-free lotion Prevent bumps, acne and clogged pores on your bum by using a gentle body scrub once or twice a week. This is especially important if you are prone to a bit of acne on your otherwise smooth behind. 2. Shower after sweating Staying in your sweaty clothes can lead to bacterial growth. So, make it a point to shower as soon as you can and use a back scrub. 3. Prevent cellulite Start dry-brushing your bum to minimise those dreaded cellulite problems. Use a brush with bristles, made out of natural fibre, and scrub in circular motions on dry skin. The best time to do this is right before taking a shower. 4. Limit your sugar intake Sugar results in some extra kilos and contributes to breakouts. It also damages the bodyâ€™s collagen and elastin, leading to wrinkles on the bum.
