WHILE experiencing load shedding on 19 May, gogo Jacobeth Masango lit a wood-burning stove to cook meat. She went outside to chat with her friends, but soon heard a loud bang. The house then caught fire. The 63-year-old from Mamelodi East, Tshwane, rushed to look for help as her 80-year-old mother was in the house. Luckily, some young people were having a meeting not far from her home and the group went to neighbours to fetch water. “Another group risked it all and took my mother out of the house. They also put out the fire,” she said. Jacobeth said they were grateful to be alive, but starting over had been difficult as they lost blankets, winter clothes and furniture in the fire. She said although Councillor Toffy Masemola donated building material, they were still in need. “We’re lucky our councillor is helping us, but the fire damaged the main house and parts of the back rooms. “We still need to pay a builder and get an electrician.” She said they didn’t open a case as they knew the cause of the fire was the wood-burning stove. Masemola pleaded for help on behalf of the family. “Both Jacobeth and her mother survive on social grants and can’t fix everything overnight. “They will need to save for months before they can be able to do that. “It’s the middle of winter and they don’t have warm clothes and blankets. “I’m pleading with anyone who can help to come forward and help the family.”
