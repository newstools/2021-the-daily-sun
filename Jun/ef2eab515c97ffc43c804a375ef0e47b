OPERATION Okae Molao continues to yield positive results. On Thursday, 17 June, acting provincial commissioner Major-General Tony Mthombeni led the operations between Booysens and Rosettenville in Joburg. Mthombeni told Daily Sun he was happy with the success achieved at the roadblock and walk about in the area. “We managed to arrest three suspects dealing in mandrax and another trading in illicit cigarettes,” said Mthombeni. He said that some vehicles were found tampered with and were taken in for further investigation.  Mthombeni told Daily Sun: “Detectives worked tirelessly looking for suspects wanted for various crimes. “A total of 713 suspects were arrested, 137 of them being for gender-based violence cases.” He said other cases ranged from murder, car hijackings to possession of unlicensed firearms. Mthombeni said the recent Dudula protests in kasis around Soweto kept cops on their toes.  He said they managed to pounce on a man suspected to be an instigator. “This man was found to be one of those pushing for chaos and the removal of foreign nationals in kasis,” he said. Mthombeni said three men were arrested in Rockville, Soweto. “One of them had an unlicenced firearm and shot one of the guys in his shop. “The man is injured and the three men are behind bars.” He said the operations will continue, especially with the protests for service delivery going on.
