CHILDLINE South Africa has a new number and it’s shorter. The number has changed to 116 from 08000 55 555. The organisation said as part of Child Protection Week, it was excited to introduce the new number. “The new number also works outside of South Africa, enabling us to join forces with other African countries in ensuring effective delivery of child protection services to all children,” said national executive officer Dumisile Nala. The organisation runs a national, 24-hour, toll-free line also providing counselling services. Nala said the new number will provide better access to child protection services throughout the continent, and allow them to strengthen partnerships with child protection agencies. “The 116 number is a regional number of all the helplines in the African region. This means if South African children were to find themselves in one of the African countries and in need of help, by dialling 116, they would be able to get through to a helpline, receive the necessary support and be effectively linked with a helpline back home.” According to annual crime statistics of 2019/2020, although there was 7% decrease, more than 900 children were killed across the country.  In the past financial year, Childline received 348 408 calls. The organisation said this was an increase of 60,26% as compared to the previous year. It further said it saw an increase of 47,08% in calls related to emotional and physical abuse, which contributed to most calls received, as well as a high amount of calls relating to neglect and physical health due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Daily Sun reported that in January, a child (7) was shot and killed along with three people following a shoot-out in Phiri, Soweto.
