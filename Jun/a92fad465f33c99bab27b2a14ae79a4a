MISS South Africa first runner-up Thato Mosehle is already preparing for the international pageant, Miss Supranational. The 26-year-old medical doctor will be heading to Poland for the pageant that’s taking place in that country on 20 August. The Miss SA organisation posted an update by Thato on their Facebook page. In the video, Thato said she’s excited about the journey ahead of her. She said they’re busy making sure everything is set. “I’m preparing for Miss Supranational, which is happening in two months. I’m so excited about that. We’re on preparations, just designing clothes, setting up a whole lot of content shoots. I’m so excited,” said Thato.

So just keep your eyes on the official Miss SA page and on my page. A lot of exciting stuff is coming up,” said the beauty queen. Thato is the second finalist to go an international pageant this year. She follows after Miss SA second runner-up Natasha Joubert went to Miss Universe in Miami, USA, last month. Unfortunately, Natasha didn’t make it to the top 21 at the pageant, but South Africans were rallying behind her from when she left the country and throughout the pageant. There was a lot of disappointment from South Africans and the rest of the world about her not reaching the top 21, but they congratulated her on her journey regardless. Next is Miss South Africa 2020 Shudufhadzo Musida, who is going to take part in Miss World. The pageant will take place in Puerto Rico on 16 December.
