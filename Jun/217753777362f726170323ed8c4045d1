I am so grateful that fellow columnist Justice Malala, who surely moves around the politically powerful circles, can write about the disrespectful way in which the ANC elite are treating South Africans. They treat Mzansi people like magoshas after pimping the country to the likes of the Gupta cartel. If it was me who wrote that column, then I would have been labelled once again as a “sell out” who attended Model C schools and therefore knows nothing about the struggle. I am also often vilified for stating, through experience and observation, that there is no single race group that loves South Africa more than the Afrikaner, yet also none more jealous of blacks’ economic advancement. Erstwhile, presidents Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma’s worshipping madding crowd also hate it when I say that the ANC enrichment was approved by Mandela, promoted by Mbeki and was merely in overdrive through Zuma and his gluttonous ilk. The much-vaunted Radical Economic Transformation (RET) brigade and the incumbent Cyril Ramaphosa is the current custodian of ANC’s looting. The writer is, however, showing his naivete for stating that the Zondo Commission of Inquiry is worth every cent. I’m sure the commission would not have been established if the first democratically elected president Mandela, did not approve the kick-start of the consequent rampant plundering of the country’s wealth way back then.
