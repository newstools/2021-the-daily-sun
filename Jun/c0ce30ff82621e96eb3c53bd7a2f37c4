TENSIONS were high during the cross-examination of former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, as he refused to answer questions. He told the Zondo Commission on Thursday, 24 June that he was not prepared to respond to questions that needed a yes or no answer. Agrizzi said he had to give context. Advocate Reg Willies, representing businessman Kevin Wakeford, wanted to know if Agrizzi still stood by his evidence he gave either in an affidavit or orally at the commission about his client. “In terms of the aspects, there might be a date or time that is wrong. But in terms of the context, was there a corrupt relationship, I never lied once. I told the truth,” he said. He said dates had nothing to do with whether or not a person received gratification from Bosasa. In 2019, Agrizzi testified that Wakeford received R100 000 monthly payments to influence SA Revenue Service investigations into Bosasa and that he had a hand in Bosasa’s renegotiated contract with the Department of Home Affairs. When Wakeford came to the inquiry, he said he worked as a consultant for Bosasa and was paid R50 000 a month. He said he was a close friend of the late Bosasa boss Gavin Watson, which made Agrizzi jealous. Wakeford explained that on a few occasions he was paid R100 000, which were “catch-up payments” for months he had not been paid. Willies asked if Agrizzi despised Wakeford and Watson to which he said no. “I despise what he (Watson) did. I despise the environment that he created that put us in a situation that we are in today,” he said.
