WISANI Shirindi has been convicted on eight counts of rape, three of kidnapping, two of assault and three of robbery with aggravating circumstances. Judge Rean Strydom handed down judgment on Thursday at the South Gauteng High Court sitting in Palm Ridge. This was after Shirindi, the man known as the Facebook rapist, lured victims from various provinces using the names Mpho or Tommy. After establishing the virtual relationship, he’d ask his victims to come to his place in Primrose near Germiston. After meeting them, he’d walk with them through the bushes, telling them it was a short cut to his place. Then in those bushes, there would be boxes or bed sheets placed on the ground where he raped them. ALSO READ:
PICS – MASHONISA HAUNTS UNDERTAKER! He’d draw a pair of scissors or knife and force the victims to perform oral sex on him before raping them. He also took pictures of his victims with their vaginas exposed, and threatened to leak them on social media should they report him to the police. One of his victims travelled from Bloemfontein after the accused had promised to find her a job in Joburg. She arrived in Germiston late at night and slept at the taxi rank, waiting for the accused.

WATCH – GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS! The next day they met and she was led to the bushes where she was raped. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and said the sex was consensual. Pictures of naked women were found on his memory card, but police needed a password to the internal memory, which he said he’d forgotten. Strydom said the court didn’t accept that he’d forgotten his password but saw it as a way of hiding whatever was on his phone. Strydom also said there was no way the woman, who came from a different province, could’ve made up the story that the accused had raped her. The matter was postponed to 27 July for pre-sentencing proceedings.
