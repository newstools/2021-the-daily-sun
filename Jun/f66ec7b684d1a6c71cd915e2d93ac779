ARTHUR Zwane is already having goosebumps ahead of his first match in charge of Kaizer Chiefs. Together with fellow interim coach Dillon Sheppard, Zwane will guide Amakhosi when they tackle Golden Arrows in their penultimate DStv Premiership match at FNB Stadium on Wednesday. “It gives me goosebumps as a coach now because I was once a player,” said Zwane. “This team taught me all about winning. When I arrived here as a player it was always about winning. Nothing will change that. My mindset is like that. I'm looking to encourage and push the players to make sure we get maximum points in the last two games. “We’re in a situation where we have to grind results “We have to take advantage of our home ground. We will take the game to them. We know who we are coming up against. But we will take them head-on. It's not going to be easy and we won't make it easy for them.” Zwane and Sheppard have come into the hotseat after Gavin Hunt was shown the door following a string of poor results. The former Chiefs winger has embraced the challenge, happy to work with some of his former teammates. “It is a sign of growth for one - seeing the players I played with when I was about to retire and some who were 13 then - showing the eagerness and the fighting spirit. It makes me proud,” he said. Amakhosi will have a full squad, except for Siyabonga Ngezana, who is out with suspension. “Nurkovic was sick but he's fully recovered, although I don't think he will give us 90 minutes. It'll be a bonus,” he said.
