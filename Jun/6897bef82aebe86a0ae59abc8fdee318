HER husband is serving 15 years in prison for armed robbery and she worries about his safety every day. The 40-year-old woman from Soweto told Daily Sun gangsters were harassing her husband in Baviaanspoort Prison in Tshwane. She said her husband was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 15 years. She said he was first sent to Sun City in Joburg, where there was discipline. But in early 2020 he was transferred to Baviaanspoort and started having problems. “My husband is always complaining that the prison is controlled by gangsters. “He says there’s no discipline in that prison. He says there are five gangs in charge,” she said. According to the woman, a prisoner was stabbed by other inmates but correctional officials didn’t do anything about it. “My husband is concerned and scared that something bad will happen to him.” Her husband’s 50-year-old uncle pleaded with the relevant minister to investigate the prison because a lot of crime is apparentluy happening there. “I don’t want my nephew to die in that prison. It’s not safe. I’m planning on suing the minister if no action is taken. We need something to be done because that prison is corrupt,” he said. Gauteng correctional services spokeswoman Zandile Mabunda said the allegations were unfounded and there was no record of unruly behaviour. “The department adheres to its core mandate of safe custody, rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders back into their communities,” she said. “All complaints by offenders are attended to and registered in the complaints and request register. “The head of the centre also attends to all complaints on a weekly basis. “Complaints are referred to the area commissioner and families are responded to in writing.” Mabunda asked offenders to follow existing channels.
