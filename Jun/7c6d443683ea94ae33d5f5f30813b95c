COPS arrested 580 suspects for various crimes in Mpumalanga last week. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the suspects were bust during an operation from 14 to 20 June for crimes ranging from murder and contravention of disaster management regulations, to carjacking, rape and robberies. He urged members of the public to obey the law and not to become reckless, especially when the country is faced with the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. “As a result, more than 85 of the total number of suspects arrested were those who contravened disaster management regulations,” said Hlathi. PUBLIC TLOF TLOF ENDS IN TEARS! “All the arrested suspects are due to appear in various courts across the province while others were slammed with summons to pay fines.” Acting provincial police commissioner, Major-General Thulani Phahla, applauded the cops. “We’re very much concerned about the conduct displayed by some community members, who’re often at social gatherings without practising social distancing and not putting their face masks on,” said Phahla. “It seems as if some people are ignorant of the fact that we’re still faced with the pandemic.”
