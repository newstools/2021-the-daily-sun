FOR years, Thateho Malatji, who was born with a disability, sat in his parents house. But all this changed on Monday, 31 May, when the 17-year-old was given a new wheelchair. EasyPay Net1 manager Desmond Moraba and administrators Marion Mhlanga and Faith Mkhabela visited his home in Violet Bank, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga to deliver the wheelchair. Moraba said he was touched by Thateho’s story after reading about him in Daily Sun on 30 April. “We contacted the SunTeam and they helped us with this wonderful arrangement. “We bought this pretty little gift to give him mobility. We are here today to hand it over to him so he can enjoy mobility. We’re also going to donate some blankets so he can keep warm throughout the winter season,” he said.  Thateho’s mum, Nelly Lebyane (51), burst into tears when she saw the wheelchair. His excited aunt Enny Lebyane (49) couldn’t hold back her tears when the team helped Thateho into the wheelchair and pushed him around. “We never expected such a wonderful gift. God has finally answered our prayers. He was always confined to his house because he didn’t have a wheelchair. This wheelchair will change that,” said Enny. “Both his parents are unemployed and are struggling to get jobs in Gauteng. “We have been in and out of Mapulaneng Hospital since 2012, asking for a wheelchair in vain.”
