Up-and-coming artist Annah “Annora” Ratsela is tackling gender-based violence on a new song titled Baba ka Thandiwe. She told SunBuzz: “This is an Afro pop song. It was composed by myself and produced by Vincent Zimu of the PMG Music Group. It was released last year. “The song is enjoying high rotation on streaming platforms.” It aims to empower women who have experienced abuse. “The song speaks against abuse. I am trying to tell those who are in abusive relationships that they don’t have to put up with abuse. “Instead, they must get help and leave those toxic relationships,” she said. “I hope this song will send a strong message to the perpetrators of gender-based violence and also give hope to the victims.” Annora is inspired by social activist Bruce Sithole, who’s been vocal about the rights of people living disabilities and albinism. “I’m hoping to do the same for our South African women and to be their voice during their difficult times,” said Annora.

Her music journey started at the age of three. “I started singing when I was still at primary school. “During lunch breaks I would jump on stage and start singing for my peers. “As I grew up I equipped myself with music information until I was ready to formally start my craft,” she said. Annora recently shot a music video with the intention to spread the same message. “My wish is for all women to live in a violence-free country and I hope my music achieves that,” she said.
