SINGER Nomcebo Zikode isn’t just a pretty face, she has a heart of gold too. The Jerusalema vocalist will soon launch the Nomcebo Zikode Foundation to help the needy. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “It was never my intention to have a foundation but my love of giving made me do it. “One day, myself and Master KG went to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Joburg to hand out toys and that really touched me,” she said. “I wanted to start something that would help people in need but would also be credible. I didn’t want donors to use my personal account to make donations because I wanted to help as many people as possible.” Nomcebo said her foundation didn’t have any specific focus other than helping people in need. “It’s for anyone in need, whether it’s kids who need food, sanitary pads or women who are being abused. We recently went to some schools in KZN and the teachers told us some of the kids didn’t have jerseys, shoes or food. “They also told us the schools had not been painted in years so we pledged to help pupils we identified with food and clothes and went to their homes to see where we could help there,” she said. Nomcebo said she was approached by a Swiss company called Idonic after she posted her good deeds on Instagram. “They offered us help and we welcomed it. They will be tracking how we use the funds over an app they use. “From 14 June, we will go to see the kids we identified and help them with their needs,” she said. Nomcebo said she also wanted to help her peers in the music industry. “Musicians are suffering as a result of the pandemic and some of don’t have enough information about how to collect royalties. “I’ve been there but I got lucky, so I want to reach out,” she said. The foundation will be launched on Wednesday, 9 June.
