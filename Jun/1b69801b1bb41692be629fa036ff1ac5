MZANSI Boxing champ Innocent “Tycoon” Mantengu has been robbed at gunpoint. The incident happened near Park Station in Joburg on Thursday. Mantengu was approached by a large group of female and male thugs wielding knives and guns. They proceeded to mug the 30-year-old of his belongings, including some of his most prized possessions – two World title belts. Mantengu’s International Boxing Federation (IBF) IBF All Africa belt as well as the World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African belts were taken. The pugilist from Mtubatuba had just won the WBA Pan African belt at Sandton Convention Centre two weeks ago. In addition, the thugs also went off with his cellphone, Gym gear as well some of his clothes in the bag he was carrying. “I was a victim of a robbery with pistols in my face and knives on my neck,” Mantengu told SunSport. “I just saw the first group of female thugs blocking my way and then another group of male thugs came from behind me with guns. “They took everything I had, I told them my wallet had no money and they took my phone, gym gear, clothes and my belts. “I was able to fight off a couple of them and that is how I managed to get away. There’s no question your life can be gone in a second.” Mantengu, who is also a teacher, said he was still shaken by the experience having come close to losing his life. He has opened a case at the police station. Mantengu has also pleaded with the public to help with any information that would lead to the recovery of his belts and other possessions. “These people will try to sell these things and I hope people can help us recover the belts at least,” added Mantengu. “I’m still not well emotionally, I am at the Police Station opening a case as we speak. I hope my possessions are recovered.”
