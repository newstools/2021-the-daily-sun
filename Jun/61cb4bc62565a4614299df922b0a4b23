Another Phuza Thursday is here and the throats are definitely open and ready for the weekend. While many of you work extremely hard for your well-earned salaries, many admittedly are working under stressful and demanding work conditions. Your deadlines and targets often demand a lot of you, and that can easily result in stress. According to experts, stress can lead one to seek much- needed stress-relieving activities, one of which is booze. While alcohol is meant to be enjoyed responsibly, many working professionals resolve to booze it up to relieve their work stress. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, over half of the world’s population consumes alcohol, and a little more than 23% have a substance and alcohol abuse problem.
