The Miss South Africa Organisation wants to break the beauty standards society has placed on women. The beauty pageant said they are open to different kinds of women regardless of height, weight, scars, hair and educational qualifications. They just opened for entries and are calling on different women to enter for this year’s pageant. “In recent years, the Miss SA Organisation has taken a firm stance on breaking barriers that women would face around their height, weight, scars, hair and educational qualifications when considering to enter for Miss SA,” they said. They made examples of Miss SA 2019 Sasha-Lee Laurel, who entered as a plus-size model as well as Busisiwe Mmotla, who made it to the top 10 in 2020 despite being shorter than the other contestants.

The organisation also made an example of former Miss Universe 2019, Zozibini Tunzi and reigning Miss SA 2020, Shudufhadzo Musida, who are rocking different hairdos from the usual ones. “Former Miss Universe and Miss SA, Zozibini Tunzi, became the first black woman with a faded cut hairstyle to walk the Miss SA stage and the current reigning queen Shudufhadzo Musida continues to redefine the definition of beauty in her baldness,” they wrote. The pageant said they will continue to stand against stereotypes. “We strive to continue to break the stereotypes and beauty standards that society and industries have placed on women,” they said.
