THEMBA Zwane has not given up on his dream of playing overseas. Zwane’s current deal with Mamelodi Sundowns ends at the end of the month, although there is an option for him to extend his stay at the club. However, the midfield star is not narrowing his options to local football. “I haven’t received any offers yet. But if I were to get an offer overseas, I’d go... get a new challenge, improve myself and see where I am as a player,” said Zwane. The 31-year-old has played over 200 matches for Sundowns since he debuted 10 years ago and has won all there is to win with the reigning league champions, including five league titles. He is currently in talks with the Tshwane giants over a new deal. “We are still talking,” said Zwane. “I love the team. That’s all I can say, and the supporters can keep on supporting the team. Obviously going forward, I would like to see myself in the team.”
