SINCE the time he was a boy, Lawrence Mogotlane (33) has loved ice cream. He’s a grown man today and turned what he loves into a business. He puts his favourite desserts on many tables in his kasi of Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni. He said his dream is to own an ice cream factory one day. He started with one machine, but with demand increasing he now has a second machine. The next step is industrial machines, which he hopes will lead to a factory. “My plan is to approach supermarkets to have my products in their fridges,” he said. He’s often booked at kasi parties and kids events. People want ice cream even in winter. “I stand at the entrances of shops to attract those with change and people support me,” he said. Lawrence said schoolkids are his big clients. He said: “Whether it’s warm or cold, they just can’t get enough.” He has flavours including strawberry, vanilla and chocolate in cones, large cups and two-litre containers. He also markets his business through social media. “I have customers as far as Soshanguve in Tshwane,” said Lawrence. And he says his intention is to negotiate with one of the supermarkets in that area so his ice cream can be delivered in the kasi and his customers will get it still in good condition. “I want to work hard so I can get a fridge van to deliver to the supermarkets so my clients can get their favourite ice cream.”
