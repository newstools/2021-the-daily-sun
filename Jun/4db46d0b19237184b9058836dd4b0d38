DSTV Premiership side Cape Town City have announced a “cooperation” with leading Serbian side FK Partizan that they hope will create a solid pathway for players into Europe in the coming years. City have sent a number of their players overseas in recent seasons, including Gift Links (Aarhus, Denmark), Lebogang Manyama (Konyaspor, Turkey) and most recently Peter Leeuwenburgh (Groningen, Netherlands). But they are hoping to increase the number and to use their relationship with FC Partizan to create opportunities. “FK Partizan's ground breaking cooperation with Cape Town City Football Club is underway, as the delegation from Belgrade visits South Africa for the first time,” City said on Monday. “The cooperation will see a number of elite African talents move to Europe in the coming years.” The Belgrade side have won 27 league titles through the years, the last in 2016-17, and were runners up in the European Cup (forerunner to the Champions League) in 1966. They are Serbia’s second most successful side after rivals Red Star Belgrade, and currently have on their books Guinea international Seydouba Soumah, who was discovered by City owner John Comitis when he was at Ajax Cape Town. -SuperSport.com
