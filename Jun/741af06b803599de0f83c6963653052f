The Springboks cancelled Sunday’s planned training session in Joburg as a precautionary measure when scheduled testing protocols returned three positive COVID-19 test results. The Boks assembled on Saturday, but yesterday SA Rugby confirmed three players tested positive for the virus, following stringent real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing procedures on arrival at the team base. The squad has been put into self-isolation as a precaution until specialist medical advice is sought from the Lions Series Medical Advisory Group (MAG) and a decision on further team activities is expected from the team management. SA Rugby Director of Rugby Rassie Erasmus emphasised that the team had followed all the necessary precautions since the start of the three-week conditioning camp hosted in Bloemfontein, which included mandatory COVID-19 testing three times a week, and that they would be led by specialist advice before any action is taken. But such cases are not unexpected as seen with the other international competitions. The Boks will be returning to international action in the first of two warm-up games against Georgia ahead of the three-Test British & Irish Lions series. Like the Lions, the Boks will live and train in bio-secure bubbles and all games will be staged behind closed doors. But at this rate, it’s almost impossible to tell just how quickly Jacques Nienabar’s team will be able to transition back into the juggernaut machine which was flattening all before them by the time the World Cup final arrived in November 2019. The problem Nienabar faces, however, is a big one as the South Africans haven’t played a Test for nearly two years. They won’t have a lot of time to prepare together before the series against the Lions. They may be hard-pressed to replicate the same form that won them the World Cup when they play that first big game at Cape Town Stadium on 24 July.
