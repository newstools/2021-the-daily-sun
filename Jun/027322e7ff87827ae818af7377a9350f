THE Constitutional Court ruling that former president Jacob Zuma present himself to jail by Sunday, or that cops would haul him to one by next Wednesday, is a judicial and political milestone since the establishment of our democracy. It’s the first time since 1994 that we’re seeing a high-profile leader being ordered to go to jail, a momentous occasion in our country’s politics. In his refusal to present himself before the Zondo Commission, as ordered by the Constitutional Court, Zuma not only went on an unprecedented attack on the judiciary and the Constitution but attacked certain judges on the bench. He steadfastly said he’d rather serve jail time than co-operate with the commission. While shoving a fat finger in the court’s face, he painted himself as a political victim and uttered veiled threats of a country going into a war, were he to be jailed. He labelled the court oppressive and unjust, saying he was faced with judicial corruption and dictatorship. Zuma’s defiant posturing sent a message that he was above the law. How is the rule of law meant to be obeyed by ordinary people when a former state president defies it? The commission’s lawyer, Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, explained how defiance by a former first citizen who’d taken an oath to protect it undermined democracy. He said jailing Zuma was the only way to restore the dignity of our constitution. Acting chief justice Sisi Khampepe’s sharp, strong rebuke of the president’s actions sends a strong message: we’re all equal before the law. Zuma must be held accountable. The former president must wear orange overalls. – Editor
