ROYAL AM are appealing the Johannesburg High Court's order that has granted Sekhukhune United three points, which automatically elevated them above the former, and qualification to the DStv Premiership. In a document seen by SunSport, Royal AM have approached the Supreme Court of Appeal, arguing that the presiding judge, Justice Sutherland DJP, who dismissed the application to review an order by arbitrator Hilton Epstein SC, has "committed various gross misdirection of fact and/or errors of law such that the appeal would have reasonable prospects of success". The KZN club are now applying for leave to appeal the judgment. "The order is inherently contradictory because the very effect of granting the NSL declaratory order is that the arbitrator must have and did indeed commit a material error of law by unduly resorting to and applying the Fifa Disciplinary Code in respect of sanction, to a domestic dispute which had nothing to do with 'eligibility' and/or a 'fielded player' but everything to do with breaching Rule 35.2 of the NSLHandbook, which deals with the requirement to list a minimum of five (5) under 23 players in a team sheet, in respect of which the Disciplinary Committee in terms of Rule 51.14.4 of the NSL Handbook had a completely free hand to choose from any one of the nine different sanctions listed in Rule 57.13.16," read part of the club's argument. In their application for leave to appeal, Royal AM further argues that the Arbitrator had committed material errors of law "in breach of section 6(2)(d) of
PAJA in awarding the three points to Sekhukhune United FC under the legally
erroneous belief that the Disciplinary Committee did not enjoy a discretion in
respect of sanction". This will now further put a poser on the planned PSL promotion/relegation play-offs which is due to start on Tuesday with Royal AM scheduled to open proceedings against Richards Bay at the Umhlathuze Sports Stadium. It is unclear now whether the KZN side will honour the fixture or wait for the date to be determined by the Supreme Court of Appeals.
