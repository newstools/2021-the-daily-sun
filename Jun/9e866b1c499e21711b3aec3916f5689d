VETERAN referee Phillip Tinyani will have a meeting with the SA Football Association (Safa) officials to get clarity on his future. It’s believed he has reached his sell-by date and must hang up his whistle as he’s over the retirement age for match officials. The retirement age for refs throughout the world is 45, and Tinyani is 46. But the Limpopo-born official is not sure about the retirement age or rule. “I want to find out from Safa what is their criteria (for retirement for referees),” said Tinyani. “I will meet them to find out. I want to be sure of their cut-off age if it’s 46 or 47. If they say 47, do they mean that if you approach 47 or you finish at 47?” Safa head of referees Abdul Ebrahim also confirmed that they’ll have a meeting with the veteran referee, who was named the 2014-15 Referee of the Season. “We have not yet had an official conversation with Phillip,” said Ebrahim. “As soon as that happens, I will be in a position to comment and confirm whether he’s staying for another season or not.” Tinyani’s first game in the PSL came 15 years ago on 20 September 2006, when Platinum Stars defeated AmaZulu 2-0 at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Phokeng, Rustenburg. In the 2014-15 Tinyani officiated in the Nedbank Cup final, when Mamelodi Sundowns defeated Ajax Cape Town on a penalty shoot-out at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. He also officiated the Telkom Knockout final in the 2012-13 season when Bloemfontein Celtic beat Downs.
