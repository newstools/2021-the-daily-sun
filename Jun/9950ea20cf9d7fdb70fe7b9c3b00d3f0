TWO Limpopo cops are in hot water after allegedly accepting a R1 000 bribe. The two convinced the mother of a raped nine-year-old girl not to press charges against the alleged rapist (23). Aged 40 and 48, the officers stationed at Tshilwavhusiku Police Station outside Makhado reportedly played middleman between the suspect’s mother and that of the victim to smoke a peace pipe. The pair was arrested in Louis Trichardt on Sunday, 13 June, and appeared in the Polokwane Magistrates Court on Monday where they were granted R2 000 bail each. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said on 28 May, the duo reportedly told the mother of the suspect to pay R8 000 to the victim’s mother in exchange for the case not to be registered. “Both cops allegedly took the victim’s mother from her house and drove to the residence of the suspect, where they found his mother. She then gave her R8 000. Afterwards, the cops received R1 000 to share,” said Mojapelo. “After the ordeal, the suspects went back to the station and made an OB entry, indicating that the victim’s mother did not wish to continue with the case, and then destroyed the unregistered docket.” Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe strongly condemned the actions of the cops, and asserted that the law must ruthlessly be applied to send a clear message that corruption will not be tolerated.
