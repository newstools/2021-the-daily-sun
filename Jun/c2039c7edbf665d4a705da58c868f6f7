The family of Maxwell Mthethwa is struggling to come to terms with his death. The 29-year-old man from Rolle Trust, outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, was stabbed to death allegedly by a neighbour during an argument at a local tavern on Saturday night, 12 June. His older brother Chriswell Mthethwa told Daily Sun he was sleeping when he received a call informing him his brother had been stabbed. “We rushed to the scene and we found him lying in a pool of blood. We tried to rush him to a nearby clinic in Thulamahashe, but unfortunately the nurse told us he was dead,” said Chriswell He said Maxwell had come back home from work in Belfast Village near Kruger National Park on Saturday morning and had gone out for drinks with friends. “We don’t know why the person stabbed him. His death left us in pain and it’s hard to accept that he’s no more. He was my only sibling and now I’m left alone.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police are investigating a case of murder after a man was stabbed with a sharp object on the neck at a tavern. “He was rushed to a local heathcare centre, but unfortunately he was declared dead on arrival. Police are busy tracing the suspect,” said Hlathi.
