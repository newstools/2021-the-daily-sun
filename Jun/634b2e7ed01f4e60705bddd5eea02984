GOGO Nyameka Komsana (64) recently died in a fire incident in Gugulethu, Cape Town. According to grandson Lulamile Komsana (22), gogo Nyameka was sleeping alone when the incident happened. “She was using a candle because there was no electricity. We think she was asleep,” said Lulamile. Now they were left all alone. “We need help. We were depending on her because our mother died two years ago. We don’t know what to do,” he said. He added that community members tried to save Nyameka’s life but the fire was too strong. “We will miss her for the love and advice she always gave us,” said Lulamile, adding that they lost everything in the fire. “We appeal to SunReaders for help. We hope once our story gets published, we will get the help we need.” Community member Vicky George said they tried everything they could to control the fire. “We tried to save gogo Nyameka but the fire was too strong. We need help so she can be buried with dignity.” Vicky said the kids were now using a primus stove, and considering that their gogo died because of fire caused by a candle, it was not a good idea. Anyone who wants to assist the family can search for Nyameka’s name on Facebook. She is survived by six grandkids between the ages of 11 and 25, and a five-year-old great grandchild. Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi confirmed the fire incident, adding that Gugulethu police opened an inquest docket for further investigation. Anyone with information was urged to call Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
