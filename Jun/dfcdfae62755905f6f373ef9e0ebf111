TWO men have disappeared following the Zandspruit mob justice attack, and the police are asking for help to trace them. Police claim Mali Dube, who has since vanished, is a suspect in the killing of eight alleged gang members. According to SAPS spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele, Mali had not been seen in the area since the incident. “Police are also looking for Joshua Given Mabodze, who is said to have information and can help in the investigation of the same murder, attempted murder and kidnapping case,” said Makhubele. He called on the public to inform police should they spot these two wanted men.  Last month, a mob of about 200 residents left their homes to hunt alleged gang members who were terrorising the community. They went to nine homes, collecting the young men while assaulting them. They then took them to a soccer field where they assaulted them further for the rest of the night, and then set them alight in the morning. Four died on the scene while four others later succumbed to their burn wounds. One was left fighting for his life in hospital. The case of the six accused was postponed to 23 June for formal bail application at the Roodepoort Magistrates Court. To report the suspects, people were urged to contact the nearest police station, call Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or download my SAPS App to give information anonymously.
