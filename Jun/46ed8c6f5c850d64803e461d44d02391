POLICE Minister Bheki Cele on Thursday visited the family that held a ceremony where eight people were shot dead in NY 79 in Gugulethu, Cape Town. Cele said according to the family, they were having a ceremony drinking traditional beer when they heard gunshots outside. “Last November, a similar incident happened in Gugulethu and we haven’t arrested anyone. Now this happens,” said Cele. He said most of these killings were a result of extortion and gang splits. “Most of the time, extortion and gangs are the reasons for these killings. These are the primary reasons that lead to these mass killings,” he added. The minister urged community members who might have information on the killings to come forward. “We need to work together to win this. If you have heard something, come forward. Do not keep quiet while people are losing their lives,” he said.  Cele added that they were working hard to arrest the suspects. Family member Khaya Nolondo was inside the house when the incident happened. “We were celebrating that we are still alive. We never knew that while thanking the ancestors, something like this would happen,” said Nolondo. He added that the incident shocked them and they did not know who would do something like this. “We are shocked, just like everyone. We have a lot of questions as to who would do something like this and why,” he said.
