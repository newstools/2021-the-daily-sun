INNOCENT “Tycoon” Mantengu has been forced to prolong his boxing career as he continues to struggle to get a teaching post. The 30-year-old, who studied for a Bachelor of Education degree at the Durban University of Technology, has found it tough to get a job as a teacher. This is mainly because he is yet to receive his degree from the institution due to the outstanding fees he owes. Mantengu, who hails from Mtubatuba in KwaZulu Natal, once taught for a brief period at his former school Silethukukhanya High School. He now hopes to settle his outstanding fees at DUT and return to being a full-time teacher. “I need to keep pushing myself hard in my boxing career while I still look for a teaching post,” said Mantengu. “I think I still have a lot of fights in me remaining but it’s no secret that I also want to resume my teaching career. “But I haven’t been able to find a post yet. You know how God works sometimes. Maybe He still has some plans for me in boxing. “I also believe that God is making me wait so I gain some more maturity before He can allow me to do what I want to do in the future. “Sometimes, you don’t appreciate the opportunity when it comes too quickly, and you end up not making the most of it. “The other obstacle is the huge debt I have at DUT that I need to settle before they can give me my degree, which I need to secure employment. “I need to settle that debt so that more doors can be opened and I can be able to do what I want to do after boxing.” Mantengu recently captured the vacant WBA Pan African junior featherweight title when he outboxed Luthando Mbumbulwana over two weeks ago. He is ready to defend his title against any worthy challenger, but insists the money must be right. “I will defend my title anytime if the purse is good. We have families that look to us for support so we can’t be paid peanuts, especially when this job is as dangerous as it is,” added Mantengu.
