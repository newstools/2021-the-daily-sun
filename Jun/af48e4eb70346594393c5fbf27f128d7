Eastern police have sent a warning to the residents of Makhanda, formerly Grahamstown, after two cops were assaulted on Monday afternoon, 14 June, while on duty. According to Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana, two police officers were patrolling near a local tavern when they noticed a group of people dancing in the middle of the road and around a loud speaker. He said the group was also carrying and drinking booze from open bottles in public. “As the police stopped to warn them against blocking the road and public drinking, they were met with insults and physical attacks, while being harassed to leave the group alone. The unruly members of the community further obstructed the police from carrying out their duty to ensure peace and order in the area by even attacking them when returning to the vehicle in which the police were driving,” Kinana said.

He said the two police officers called for reinforcement which resulted in the arrest of two instigators of violence and attack on police. “They arrested male and female suspects aged between 28 and 35 are currently in detention in Grahamstown. They are expected in court on 17 June 2021 on charges relating to assault on police and malicious damage to property. More arrests are imminent,” Kinana said. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said: “An attack on our police officers is an indirect attack on the rule of law and government. We are going to deal decisively with disruptive criminal elements who consistently launch an onslaught on innocent officers. Our members will continue fighting crime undeterred and nobody will stop them from carrying out this mandate.”
