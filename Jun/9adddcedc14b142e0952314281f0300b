THE family of slain Limpopo student Precious Ramabulana (21) has welcomed her killer’s sentencing. Aubrey Manaka was handed down two life sentences by the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane on Friday, 11 June. The 30-year-old was also given 15 years’ imprisonment for robbery and eight for housebreaking, which will run concurrently with the two life sentences. However, the Ramabulana family are concerned about the well-being of Precious’ mother, Peggy (39), who is suffering from depression. She has been in and out of psychiatric institutions since she learnt of her daughter’s brutal death in 2019. Precious’ aunt, Mavis Sitholimela, (52) said they were still hurting. “It’s so hard for us all. We looked after her mother. When she talks to us she tells us she wants Precious.” Mavis said she understood her pain. “Precious shared the Nsfas stipend meant for her survival with her family. She saved the R1 500 she got from Nsfas and bought furniture and a TV for her mother. She’d promised she’d build a better house for her mother. We all expected a better life for her family after she finished studying,” she said. She said they were thankful to President Cyril Ramaphosa for building a house for Precious’ mother. Precious, a public management student at Capricorn TVET College in Botlokwa, Limpopo, was attacked, raped and stabbed to death in November 2019.
