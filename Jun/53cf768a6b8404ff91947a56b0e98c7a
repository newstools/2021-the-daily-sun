VETERAN sports administrator, Ntambi Ravele, will be part of the new era ushered in by the new administration at Cricket South Africa (CSA). Ravele is one of the seven independent directors appointed by the Independent Directors Nominations Panel, a list which includes Steven Budlender SC, Andrew Hudson, Dugmore Lushaba, Lawson Naidoo, Andisa Ntsubane and Mark Rayner. Rihan Richards has been elected as president, Donovan May as vice-president, both by unanimous vote. Daniel Govender, John Mogodi, Craig Nel, Tebogo Siko and Simphiwe Ndzundzu, were elected as non-independent directors at the CSA general Ravele, a seasoned administrator, resigned as Tennis SA board member last September after long-running battles with Sascoc boss Barry Hendricks over administrative differences. For the longest time, CSA has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. But it is hoped the new administration will bring a needed change. “We must promote the interest of the game in South Africa above all else, and ready ourselves to be the servants of the game and the nation,” said Richards. “We must continue to seek and promote what is right and let’s remind ourselves that it’s not about us but the game. Cricket has a critical role to play in the social cohesion of our nation and it is a challenge that we dare not fail. “As we head to a new board, we will face many challenges but there is a foundation for them to succeed. We will succeed if we all hold each other accountable and we are united.” In his keynote address, Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa said: “We must continue to seek and promote what is right and let’s remind ourselves that it’s not about us but the game.”
