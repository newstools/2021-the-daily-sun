Eskom is having difficulties in supplying us with electricity, so we must choose to be wise by using it sparingly during winter. Things are going to get worse with load shedding. There’s also an increased risk of unplanned outages during winter. The power utility is struggling to keep up with urgent maintenance while burning expensive diesel to keep the lights on. South Africa’s load shedding conundrum is compounded by the urgent need for planned maintenance of Eskom’s plants. But this load shedding is really getting to me this time around. It’s not like we’re blackout virgins. We’ve been through this before. But this time it just seems to be impacting me a lot worse. It invades every aspect of our lives and the knock-on effects are real. It’s making me angry and short- tempered. This load shedding truly is demoralising. Nelson Kgatla, Pretoria North
