There might be a range of big, bigger and biggest 4-5s in the world. And according to the Mirror.uk magazine, these are the three biggest 4-5s in the world: 1. Jonah Falcon, New York Actor Jonah said his 34cm 4-5 has hampered his career as film directors are sometimes put off by his manhood fame. The 51-year-old bisexual man also previously hit headlines when he caused a security alert at a US airport due to the bulge in his trousers. 2. Roberto Esquivel Cabrera, Mexico Roberto said the sheer size of his 48cm manhood prevents him from working and has pleaded to be registered as disabled. Roberto made the headlines in 2015 after a video went viral showing him weighing his member to prove its authenticity. 3. Steve Whitehurst, Stoke-on-Trent Although he doesn’t claim to have a record-breaking 4-5 size, Steve was accused of shoplifting last year after suspicious staff spotted a larger-than-usual bulge in his trousers. The unsuspecting 54-year-old and his girlfriend Mandy Shenton were about to pay for £400 (about R7 900) worth of clothes at Scotts Menswear in Stoke-on-Trent when the drama unfolded.
