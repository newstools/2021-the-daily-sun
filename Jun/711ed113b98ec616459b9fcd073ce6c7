THE future of Kaizer Chiefs veteran striker Bernard Parker and midfielder Willard Katsande with Amakhosi is still uncertain. A reliable source told SunSport that both players have been offered a one-year deal respectively by the Soweto giants, as their contracts expire at the end of this month. However, the deal is expected to be finalised after Chiefs Caf Champions League’s two legged clash against Moroccan side Wydad Atletic. The first leg will be played in Morocco next Saturday, with the return leg taking place at FNB Stadium on 26 June. Said the source: “The management will engage the players about their new contracts after the Caf Champions League. The two players still have a big role to play for the club as they will also guide youngsters on and off the pitch.” But Parker’s agent Mike Makaab said the Amakhosi management are yet to engage him about the new deal. Said Makaab: “Nothing has been discussed as yet.” The duo are the longest serving players at the club, with Katsande having joined the club in 2011 from Ajax Cape Town while Parker arrived at the same time from Greek club Panserraikos. Katsande was a regular the previous seasons, and he helped Chiefs in the 2019-20 season finish in second spot under coach Ernst Middendorp. But when Gavin Hunt took over the helm before the start of last season, the Zimbabwean saw little game time as he started just 10 matches, coming on as substitute six times. On the other hand, Parker was one of Hunt’s trusted players having made 39 appearances in all competitions, including the Caf Champions League where he played 10 matches. However, the midfield role he played under the former Bidvest Wits mentor limited his scoring ability, as he scored just one goal last season.
