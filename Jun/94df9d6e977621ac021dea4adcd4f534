IT seems Thembinkosi Lorch’s career, as far as his future is concerned, isn’t the only confusing thing about his life. His love life appears to be just as mysteriously puzzling to those that are keeping tabs. The Bucs star has been linked with a move away from the Soweto giants for the past few years. Lorch has been reported to be a target for several overseas clubs including Belgian sides Royal Union Saint-Gilloise and Club Brugge. The 27-year-old has also been linked with a move to local rivals Kaizer Chiefs, Mamelodi Sundowns and Egyptian giants Al Ahly. This has left many supporters scratching their heads trying to figure out where he could end up. Off the field, Lorch has been equally mysterious, especially concerning his rumoured relationship with actress Natasha Thahane. The pair sparked dating rumours on social media this past weekend when they both posted their pictures on their respective vacations. READ: LORCH LINKED TO NATASHA ON ROMANTIC DATE!

However, both Lorch and Natasha poured cold water to the rumours. READ: LORCH: SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND! They have since decided to let the cat out of the bag, it seems.
