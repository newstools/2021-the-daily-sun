PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) acting chief executive, Mato Madlala, has confirmed that the league will have to tighten up its legal department next season to avoid embarrassment in the future. Madlala was referring to the embarrassing legal events that engulfed the league over the winner of the GladAfrica Championship this season. She admitted that things got out of hand, causing unnecessary drama. The drama finally played out when Sekhukhune United won the Championship via the courtroom on Saturday. This was after Polokwane City were found guilty of having infringed the PSL handbook by failing to include five under-23 players against Sekhukhune on 2 January this year, which the latter lost 1-0, but played under protest. Sekhukhune were finally awarded three points on Saturday, which saw them promoted to the DStv Premiership. The saga dragged out for almost six months and put the PSL legal department under pressure as they failed to resolve the case in time. But Madlala said people have the right to take matters to court if they are not happy. She said: “In our judicial system people are allowed to exercise their rights. In our industry, it starts from our DC , it then goes to the arbitration, then the review committee if there is a need, just like the constitution says as a country, then moves to the Supreme Court and Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). “We do encourage that to clubs, we don’t dictate, we are not hiding anything. We say, if you are not happy with any outcome, it is your right to take the matter forward.” Madlala said they have learnt their lesson that they will need to beef up their legal team: “The PSL (DC) judicial is independent from the league so that so there’s no influence from anybody. But we do see that we have to reinforce and give it more budget to quicken cases. We can’t be embarrassed every season about cases.,” she said.
