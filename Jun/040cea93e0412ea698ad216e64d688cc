THE ANC has condemned acts of violence after two members were shot and wounded and 16 others hurt. On Saturday, 19 June, a scuffle broke out at a general branch meeting in Ga-Seleka, outside Lephalale in Limpopo. Several vehicles parked at the venue were pelted with stones. According to witnesses, windows were broken, guns were fired and people fought with pangas, knobkerries and sharp objects. Making matters worse, victims were allegedly followed to Witpoort Hospital and nurses and doctors had to flee. It was still not clear what led to a peaceful branch meeting erupting in violence. ANC Waterberg region spokesman Matome Moremi-Taueatsoala said it was worrying that the attackers had not been arrested. “This has the potential to turn the Lephalale Sub-Region into a hot spot for political violence in the province. We implore the provincial police commissioner to intervene and bring the culprits to book,” he said. “These acts of thuggery and hooliganism have no space within the ANC, which is supposed to be a model of discipline. We are shocked and scared that dangerous objects were able to find their way into an ANC gathering.” Moremi-Taueatsoala said it was concerning that the violence was also directed at women, some of who had to run for cover as their cars were pelted with stones. All branch general meetings for the rest of the weekend were called off to allow for security to be organised. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a 41-year-old was arrested and charged with attempted murder, assault and malicious damage to property. The suspect will appear in the Palala Magistrates Court soon. Police investigations continue.
