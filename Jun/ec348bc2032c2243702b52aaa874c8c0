The Department of Health has
denied that any officials have been suspended over the Digitals Vibes tender
saga. Over the weekend, Sunday
World reported that four officials had been placed on precautionary suspension
by Health Minister Zweli Mkhize for their role in the Digital Vibes saga. Those suspended, the paper
reported, included Dr Anban Pillay, the department's deputy director-general
for health regulations and compliance management, and Popo Maja, chief director
for communications and stakeholder management. They were allegedly
suspended after a report by the Ngubane Management Company implicated them in
irregularities in the awarding of a R150 million communications tender to
Mkhize's associates - Digital Vibes, Mkhize's former aide Tahera Mather, and
his former personal assistant Naadhira Mitha. On Sunday, health department
Director-General Sandile Buthelezi denied the suspensions and said Mkhize
didn't get involved in the department's administrative functions. "As indicated on
previous occasions, the Director-General, as the accounting officer of the
department, is dealing with all investigations relating to the Digital Vibes
matter working with the Special Investigation Unit. The Director-General is
also working on the implementation of the recommendations from
investigations." Buthelezi said
investigations were ongoing, and that the department could not mention people
implicated, so as not to hamper the outcome. The Daily Maverick has
reported how Digital Vibes has paid for maintenance invoices for a property
owned by Mkhize and his family in Bryanston. They also reported how Digital
Vibes paid about R300 000 into a company owned by the Mkhize's son Dedani in
2020. On Friday, Mkhize was
supposed to appear before Parliament. However, he did not appear and said he
had received legal advice not to do so. Opposition parties are also
calling for his resignation, and the Democratic Alliance has laid criminal
charges against him. SOURCE: NEWS24
