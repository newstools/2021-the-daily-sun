NOMPUMELELO Mosoane (33) was six months pregnant and looking forward to giving birth, but she died before the child could be born. An armed man stormed into her rented room in Braamfischerville in Soweto last Tuesday and fired a shot into her head. She died at the scene. The grieving family told Daily Sun nothing was stolen and they believe it was a hit. Her brother (37) said he was with her. “Nompumelelo had just finished working on her laptop. The door wasn’t locked. Suddenly, an armed man with a mask walked in and closed the door behind him “He took out his gun, instructed us to lie on the floor, and without warning he shot my sister in the head. “When he opened the door I saw another man waiting for him outside the door. They fled together. I heard a car racing away. “I covered my sister with a blanket and rushed out to call for help. Nothing was taken. They had come to kill her.” Nompumelelo’s brother and her cousin said they only learnt after her death that Nompumelelo had problems with someone close to her. Nompumelelo’s brother said: “I wish they could have killed me instead.” Nompumelelo, who had recently graduated as a pastor, has been described as God-fearing, bubbly and peaceful. Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of murder was opened for investigation and no arrests have been made yet. “Police are still searching for the suspects,” he said.
