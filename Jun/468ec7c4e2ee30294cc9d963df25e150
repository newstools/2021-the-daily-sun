THE testimony against alleged rapist pastor John Masilela (44) continues to shock the court in the KwaMhlanga Regional Court. Three of the victims testified before Magistrate Merlene Greyvenstein yesterday. One victim (23) told the court he joined the Good Shepherd Christian Centre in Sun City near KwaMhlanga in 2009. “I was still a member when the pastor gave me the name of Prayer. He asked me to send pictures of my penis so that he could pray for it,” said the witness. The second victim (30) told the court he joined the church in 2011 and his ordeal began in 2014. “He sent a text telling me to send a photo of my 4-5 because he was about to pray,” he said. He said he stayed in a house on the church premises. “One day the pastor said he wanted to pray for me and called me into his bedroom,” he said. “He told me to raise my hands and when my eyes were closed I felt his hand touching my 4-5.” The third victim (24) said the pastor called him in 2016 to connect the sound. “He said we must go to his room for prayer. He suddenly inserted his hand in my pants and grabbed my 4-5. I stepped back and left. I never went back there again.” The pastor is facing three charges of rape, sexual assault and transfer of pornography. He was arrested in May 2020. He’ll appear again in court on 21 and 22 July.
