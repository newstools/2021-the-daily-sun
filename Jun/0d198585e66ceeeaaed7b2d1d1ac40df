Author and model Phumzile Ntshabele has penned her first book, My Mother Hates Me. The talented author from Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, said the book is based on her personal story and the way her mother used to treat her after her elder brother died. “We all know that when people speak about mothers, they all paint them in the same brush that they are perfect. But the truth is not all of us have the same experience with our mothers. Some of us are being ill-treated and with this book I wanted to create that awareness,” she said. “Recalling and penning all the memories down was not an easy experience because I had to go back and revisit the 13-year-old girl who didn’t understand why her mother hated her so much. As much as I was writing the book, I was also seeking and taking my final step of healing so there was a lot of tears in between,” she said. Phumzile said she was glad she had built up the courage to write the book as she felt lighter afterwards. “I recommend that people write or speak about their experiences because it will help them heal.” ALSO READ | CELEBS TACKLE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY The 39-year-old said she started penning her book in March this year. “The hatred my mother had for me made seek better opportunities for myself. Her hate kept me going and all the bad things that she wished upon me made me want to reach for the sky and fulfil my dreams no matter what. I knew that only I can decide on how my life should go.” She said that she’d release another book soon as she planned for the books to be a series. “The story doesn’t end here because I was unable to touch on my whole life’s story in the first book. It was too much. I had to break it down. So, soon enough I will also release another book which will be a continuation.” Phumzile also told Daily Sun she has entered the Mrs Universe competition and she is looking forward to a fruitful journey ahead.
