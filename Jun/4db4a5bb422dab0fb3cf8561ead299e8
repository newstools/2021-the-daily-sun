PROSTITUTION is one of many industries that have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. NGOs in India have come to the rescue of many magoshas struggling to make ends meet during this difficult time. A local publication, India Today, reported that thousands of magoshas have been severely affected as they are unable to perform their work. A non-governmental organisation called Saheli Karyakarta Sangh has come to the rescue of many magoshas who were complaining about financial needs, and dealing with insomnia among other health issues. The director of the NGO, Tejaswi Sevekari, said they were concerned with domestic violence cases they’ve been getting from some of the prostitutes.

Sevekari said their organisation managed to help more than 700 magoshas go back to their homes when the pandemic started and said they also assisted other prostitutes to sell vegetables and get employed in mask and sanitiser industries. One of the magoshas, Rupali (name changed) said Covid-19 restrictions have been chasing customers since March last year. “Since there’s not a single customer coming now, we have zero income, and we are unable to pay for these necessities on time. “For now, I’m working with Saheli NGO from which I am able to at least pay the house rent,” she told the publication.
