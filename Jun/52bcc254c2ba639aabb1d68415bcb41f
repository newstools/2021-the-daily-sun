STONES found at Hlathi village in Ladysmith in the KZN
midlands are not diamonds but quartz crystals. This announcement was made by KZN Economic Development,
Tourism and Environmental Affairs Ravi Pillay who was accompanied by the
intergovernmental team which included officials from the Department of Mineral
Resources and Energy and a variety of KZN MEC’s during the release of the
analysis report made by a number of experts. The reported feedback comes after a team of geoscientists
and mining experts visited the site to inspect and collect these stones for
testing. Pillay said: “Stones found in Hlathi village are not diamond
but quartz crystals. The analysis also reveals that the geographic location of
the village it is impossible to have diamonds. The value of the quart crystals
is very low compare to a diamond value.” The diamond rush started after a local man who was heading
cows claimed that he has found a diamond at the hilltop, the following day
other locals took their picks and shovels to dig for this precious stone. A few days after, hundreds from different parts of the
country joined the digging. Last week, the team of experts was introduced to the diggers
and they took the samples of the stone to go and check if this was the real
diamond or not.
