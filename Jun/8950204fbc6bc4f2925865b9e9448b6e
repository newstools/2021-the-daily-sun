VETERAN actress Connie Chiume recently celebrated her 69th birthday, and 40 of those years were spent in showbiz. She told Daily Sun she was grateful to her family and fans for the support they’d showed her over the years. “I feel very blessed that I’m still around, healthy, working and relevant in the industry. I’m grateful to God for this milestone,” she said. Connie said some of her highlights so far were leaving the teaching and nursing professions to pursue her purpose, acting. “My first acting job remains one of the biggest highlights in my career because I’d left teaching and nursing. Showbiz was always something I wanted to do because, growing up, I used to perform for my family and friends. Someone gave me an opportunity to do what I love. They opened a door for me,” she said.
