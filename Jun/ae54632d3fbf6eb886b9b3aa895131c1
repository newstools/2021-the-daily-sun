THERE was a time when Oupa Mabote (42) used dogs to guard his yard from robbers. But these days he prefers geese because they make would-be thieves run for their lives. Oupa from Bekkersdal, west of Joburg, works as a machine operator at a mine in Westonaria. He said his family sleeps peacefully at night without worrying about thugs. He spends less than R500 a month on feeding them. Oupa said he got the geese from his gogo in Magaliesburg for free because she breeds them. Oupa said before he got the geese, thugs would jump into his yard and steal the chickens he breeds. “Some of them use strong muthi to make everything and everyone sleep. “You can wake up in the morning and find you’ve been cleaned out. “But the geese have powers to even sniff muthi and evil spirits.” Mabote claims there was a sangoma who came into his yard pretending to sell peanuts and the birds chased him out. He said the dogs are not as effective as geese. “Whoever comes to my yard with bad intentions will find my angels waiting for him.” Oupa has had his big geese for years and he takes good care of them because they take care of him. “They can be aggressive even towards me,” he warns. Daily Sun spoke to residents who said they don’t go into the yard. They call at the gate to be let inside. “They’re wild and can injure a person if you’re not careful,” said neighbour Tumelo Moloi. Resident Arabang Mosia said: “I’m also thinking of getting some geese,” he said. Since the start of lockdown crime is high and dogs are sometimes poisoned.”
