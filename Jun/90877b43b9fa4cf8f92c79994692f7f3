THE use of video assistant referees (VAR) has had its good and bad moments since it was introduced. On Saturday, Kaizer Chiefs striker Samir Nurkovic had his goal verified by VAR when Amakhosi defeated Wydad Athletic Club 1-0 in Morocco in the first leg of their Caf Champions League semi-final showdown. Nurkovic latched onto an inch-perfect cross from Njabulo Blom to rattle the back of the net in the first half to give Chiefs the lead with a crucial away goal. However, the linesman flagged for offside, but the VAR replay showed that Nurkovic was onside by the finest of margins, and VAR overruled the on-field decision, and the goal was awarded. Talking after the win, Nurkovic was happy that the VAR played its role. He said: “It’s important (having VAR) because there will be less cheating. “If it (VAR) was not important, then none of the biggest leagues in the world would be using it. “I am really happy to have contributed to the victory, and it was really a good team effort. So we just have to continue with the same fighting spirit.” The Serbian striker warned his teammates that it is still halftime. The job is not yet done. He stated: “We can’t celebrate yet. We are playing them at home (at FNB Stadium in the second leg on Saturday), and we have to make sure we win that game as well. I am going to leave that (the strategy for the second leg) to the coach because we have a very good coach. “They (teammates) have to be happy. It’s really a good result away from home and it’s the first leg of the semi-final of the Champions League.” This is Chiefs first appearance in the semi-finals of the continent’s premier club tournament. And they also became the first SA team to beat Wydad in their backyard.
