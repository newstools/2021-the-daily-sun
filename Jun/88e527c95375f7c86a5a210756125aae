MARITZBURG United coach, Ernst Middendorp, has lived up to his promise of keeping the club in the DStv Premiership when he was appointed in November. Maritzburg finished 13th with 30 points, after a goalless draw against AmaZulu in their last game of the season at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday. When Middendorp was appointed as Maritzburg coach on 24 November, the club was at the bottom of the log table with no points after losing their opening five league games. This led to the sacking of coach Eric Tinkler. “It’s a huge compliment to have secured our status in the PSL after the disastrous start. “The first round of the season we only had nine points and were rock bottom. I think it is a huge achievement,” said Middendorp. In the German’s first game in charge against Mamelodi Sundowns, Maritzburg held their own after getting a draw to earn their first point of the season. Middendorp won eight, lost nine, and drew 10 in 27 games in all competitions he was in charge of Maritzburg this season. Heading to the last game of the season against Usuthu, Maritzburg (on 29 points), would have had to lose by seven goals to be drawn into the promotion/relegation play-offs. “Planning for this game (against AmaZulu) was to monitor the goal difference. “That’s why our defence line was built with four centre backs,” added Middendorp, who also saved Maritzburg from relegation in the 2015-16 season.
