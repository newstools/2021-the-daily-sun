MOSHINE “Mo” Mametja is trying her luck in the 2021 Miss South Africa pageant. The 26-year-old, who plays Mary on Mzansi Magic’s DiepCity, said she hoped to make it far. She entered the pageant last year but wasn’t chosen. But she won’t let that discourage her. “I told myself I needed to do it again and again,” she said. “My hope is to move as far as I can. I don’t like limiting myself. If I don’t reach the top 10 it doesn’t mean I’m not good enough. “Wherever my journey ends, it means that’s where I was meant to be. I’ll not give up.” Mo said becoming Miss SA had been her dream for years. “Maybe I’m the person they’re looking for, or maybe not. I’m hoping it will work out for the best. I’ve won two beauty pageants in primary school.

I taught them drama because I’m a drama graduate. “There’s so much talent back in the villages, but people don’t have knowledge of the career paths that are available. “I want to tell young kids they can be whatever they want to be.” Mo said many of her fans were shocked that she entered Miss SA because of the character she plays. “I’m getting many beautiful messages from people saying I played Mary so well and are shocked to see I’m not like her in real life.”
