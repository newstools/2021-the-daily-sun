RESIDENTS of Mmakaunyane in North West said a falling bridge that connects to Lebalang Village is a disaster waiting to happen. They said the bridge started to drop in January and they raised their concerns with the relevant authorities, but nothing was done. They want the North West Department of Public Works and Roads to attend to the matter. Resident Joseph Mosupye said the bridge was old and a new one was needed. “As I live close to this bridge, it’s not easy to watch people risk their lives driving over it. This is a very busy road,” he said. Joseph said using the bridge was risky on rainy days. “Maybe the Department of Public Works should consider building a new bridge and also constructing a tar road,” he said. Another resident, Amos Moche, said the bridge is a ticking time bomb. “We’ve not heard of any disasters, but we’ll soon see many accidents as the road is getting narrow by the day,” he said. Amos said they asked the Moretele Municipality to intervene but were told the provincial government is responsible for the bridge. North West public works and roads spokesman Matshube Mfoloe said it would appear that the low-lying bridge was among several in the province that were damaged by recent floods. “It’s the responsibility of our district operation unit to carry out repair works or maintenance of roads and bridge,” said Mfoloe. Mfoloe said substantial amount of money had been spent on flood damage repair works in all four districts, and one could only assume the bridge wasn’t reported. “Communities should contact the chairperson of the District Road Forum and also chief director of district operations to seek maintenance interventions on provincial roads in their respective areas,” he told the People’s Paper.
