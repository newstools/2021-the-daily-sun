TOP maskandi artists have threatened to beat each other up. In the middle of the war is award-winning, controversial Mthandeni “Igcokamelisha” Manqele and Khangelani “DSD” Mhlongo. Mthandeni has demanded an apology from Khangelani for spreading “lies” that he slapped him a few years ago.  He said if Khangelani refused, he would be left with no choice but to continue bashing him through his music. “He told his friends and fans that he slapped me at a meeting a few years ago. That is a lie. He must tell the truth and apologise, otherwise this beef between us won’t end well. He knows that I’m not scared of him. He can never slap me and I can prove that to him,” he said. On the other hand, Khangelani said he did slap Mthandeni and would do so again if he didn’t stop poking his eye. “Mthandeni lacks respect. He always wants to start war with people. I’m not going to tolerate his nonsense. He bashes me in his songs. One of them says: ‘Ngizokuqeda kancane kancane okwamashethi eNjomane (I will make you vanish like Njomane’s shirts).’ Everyone knows that I wear a certain style of shirts and that my clan name is Njomane. So this guy undermines me. I will slap him again if he continues with his nonsense,” he said.
