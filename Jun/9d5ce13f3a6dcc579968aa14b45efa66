NDISHAVHANI Mutavhatsindi will remain in police cells until 3 August. This after the Tshaulu Periodical Court outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo, postponed her bail application on Wednesday, 30 June. The 42-year-old mum from Ha-Lambani faces a murder charge after she allegedly beat her 11-month-old baby boy to death. Mutavhatsindi allegedly locked herself and the baby in her house and prayed. She then allegedly started hitting the child, who was rescued by neighbours after they heard his cries. But the neighbours were too late. NPA Limpopo spokeswoman Mashudu Malabi-Dzangi said the baby was certified dead on arrival at a local clinic. “People had to break down the door to gain entry in order to save the baby. “This resulted in the state taking the suspect for mental evaluation to check if she wasn’t under any psychologic attack when she launched the attack on her baby boy,” she said. Malabi-Dzangi said the case was postponed to allow the police to continue with their investigations.
