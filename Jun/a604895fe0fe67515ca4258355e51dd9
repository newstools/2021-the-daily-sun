MECHANICS with small workshops used to get police tenders but they say bosses are now sidelining them in favour of big dealerships. They have also made allegations that police bosses have been getting kickbacks from dealerships. The angry mechanics said this has affected their businesses and some have even been forced to close down. They have vowed to fight tooth and nail to expose corrupt police bosses. On Thursday, 27 May mechanics from Ekurhuleni and Joburg went to the police offices in Silverton, Tshwane, to hand over a memorandum. They were promised a response by Thursday 3 June. Mechanic Richard Ndlebe said: “We also want a share of the pie. “We did everything to comply with their requirements, but they still shut the door in our faces.” Richard, who is from Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni, said many families were suffering as a result of the decision made by the police service’s supply chain management. He said many of the affected mechanics ran small workshops in CBDs and couldn’t afford to pay rent any more. “We did everything to meet their demands and we have been working with the police very well for years, but now someone has decided to sideline us,” he said. Richard said many of the mechanics had workshops in CBDs but came from the kasi. “The government is always preaching empowerment of small businesses but at the same time, they don’t practise it,” he said. “How do they expect us to survive if they take away our livelihoods? Covid-19 has hit many of us.” Colonel Athlenda Mathe, national police spokeswoman, said they were looking into the matter.
