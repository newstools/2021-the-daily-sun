FORMER Bafana Bafana captain Steven Pienaar has described his appointment as the U-18 assistant coach at Ajax Amsterdam as a huge step. Just as his career was chiselled in the Ajax development structures two decades ago, Pienaar has gone back to the Dutch Eredivisie giants to begin a new journey as a coach. “It is definitely a big step for me. The team is in the Uefa Champions League youth league and so it is a massive step,” said Pienaar. “I’ve started in the junior structures and know a lot about development. I feel I’m at the right place and my experience will also help me in this role. Development is very important for the success of every club. And as you may know Ajax support development.” Pienaar added he had completed his Uefa A License and confirmed he was currently busy studying towards a Pro License. He will be working with head coach Dave Vos, another young mentor also cutting his teeth with the youth side. Pienaar retired in 2018 following a spell with Wits University. He quickly began his coaching journey when he joined Dutch amateur side SV Robinhood as an assistant to Nana Tutu. Tutu has a great history with Ajax, having been instrumental in bringing a lot of African players to the Dutch club. Schillo, as Pienaar is affectionately known, then returned to Ajax as a trainee coach with the hope of improving his skills as he worked towards a Pro License. He also worked as a technical trainer at the middle school of the Ajax academy. The system is not entirely new to Schillo. The Westbury-born coach is a product of the Ajax development system. He started at the now-defunct Ajax Cape Town before moving to the parent club in Amsterdam. There he spent five successful years before he could spread his wings and join Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund and later three English Premiership sides.
