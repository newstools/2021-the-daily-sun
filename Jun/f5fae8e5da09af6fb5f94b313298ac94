SOUTH Africa Under-23 coach David Notoane has told SunSport that Percy Tau will not be travelling to the Japan Tokyo Olympic Games scheduled for next month. Tau was earmarked to be one of the overaged players in Notoane’s squad. However, things will no longer go as planned for Notoane. The Olympic tournament will be held between 21 July and 7 August and is not an official Fifa competition which means clubs are not obliged to let their players go. Notoane is expected to announce the final squad that will represent Mzansi at the world event on Saturday. Talking to SunSport, the coach said: “The issue of the foreign-based players like Percy Tau, the club (Brighton & Hove Albion) wrote that they are not going to release him. “We also engaged with the player, we had a very long conversation with him and we could see that he is in a tight corner. He is faced with a situation where he is asking ‘do I go to the Olympics or stay with the club and fight for my place and prove to the coach.” The new Premier League season starts on 13 August with The Seagulls Albion will kick-off their campaign with an away match to Burnley the following day on Saturday 14 August. Other overseas-based players that their teams did not permit them are Sphephelo Sithole and Thibang Phete, who are plying their trade in Portugal for Balances SAD and Khanya Leshabele of Leicester City. South Africa was drawn in Group A with hosts Japan, Mexico and France. They will face the host Japan in the opening match on 22 July. Other superstars who were expected to show up at the Olympic Games from other countries but reported that their teams would not release them includes Paris Saint-Germain superstars Kylian Mbappe and  Neymar. Mbappe is currently part of the France senior team in the Euro Championship, and Neymar (who was going to join Brazil as one of their overaged players) is also doing duties for Brazil national team at the Copa América.
