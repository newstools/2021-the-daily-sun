FOR 20 years, Masenya Moema made a living as a bricklayer. But he also learnt to make strong and beautiful wooden structures. Masenya from Stinkwater, Hammanskraal in Tshwane, makes structures like dog kennels as well as chairs, tables and Wendy houses from wooden pallets. “The idea of using pallets came when a neighbour asked me to build a shack for him after his was stolen,” Masenya told Daily Sun. “My first one wasn’t that good so to improve, I built a few kennels for community members.”  Since then, he has built five structures – one for a kitchen and another for a preschool, the third one for sleeping rooms for kids, the fourth for a tavern and the last one for a farmer. As most are different sizes, they also differ in price. They’re all mostly made from old wooden pallets. Once completed, Masenya applies oil to make the wood last long and advises customers to maintain the structures. He often requires the help of one or two assistants to make sure that the work gets completed sooner. “I think with time, more people will get to see the benefit of structures like this one. It is environmentally friendly and good for areas with high temperatures,” Masenya told the People’s Paper. “I plan to put a thatch roof on some structures, but I will always put a sheet metal ceiling to prevent fire from getting inside.”
