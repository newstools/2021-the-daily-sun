A HEAD-ON collision involving a VW Polo and BMW sedan has killed five people. The collision happened on the N1 North outside Louis Trichardt in the Vhembe District of Limpopo on Thursday evening when the Polo driver was allegedly overtaking and collided with an oncoming car. Both drivers were killed instantly together with three passengers. One passenger survived with serious injuries and was rushed to a hospital in Louis Trichardt. Transport Department spokesman Mike Maringa said reckless driving was cited as a possible cause. “This is a second fatal head-on accident reported on the N1 North in the past 48 hours where we have already lost eight lives,” he said. The other one happened on Wednesday when three people were killed and five escaped with minor injuries in a head-on collision involving VW and Renault sedans at Ga-Phasha village in Botlokwa outside Polokwane.  The driver of the VW was allegedly overtaking on a barrier line when the car collided head on with a Renault. “Three people were certified dead at the scene and five taken to Botlokwa Hospital with minor injuries. Reckless driving was cited as a possible cause,” Maringa said. Transport MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya was worried about the reckless behaviour leading to loss of life.  Lerule-Ramakhanya cautioned motorists to reduce speed and avoid overtaking unnecessarily. “It is not acceptable that every day we wake up to sad news of people killed by reckless drivers. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who lost their loved ones. We hope other drivers will work together to reduce fatal crashes on our roads,” said the MEC.
