THE best way to kill a joke about yourself is to laugh at yourself. Following the memes and jokes made about her on social media, Muvhango actress Candy Magidimisa has decided to take her power back. She is using the same memes that were meant to humiliate her to empower others. The 28-year-old, who plays the character of Shaz in the soapie, is putting together an album with a collection of memes made about her on social media. The album will be launched on Muvhango social media on 15 June. Shaz, whose face has been used as a meme by hundreds of users, said the aim was to show people that they could turn whatever was meant to humiliate them into humour. She said she hoped this would help many young people who were victims of bullying to use whatever negativity thrown at them to their advantage. “I did this meme album to empower those who are victims of cyberbullying to laugh at themselves, their faults and imperfections. This removes the sting from any bad joke about a person. It disempowers the bully,” said the Limpopo-born actress. She added that what other people thought or said about you should not define who you are. “What matters is what you think about and how you see yourself. It begins with the conversations you hold with yourself,” she added. She said many successful comedians were once victims of bullying and ridicule, but laughing at themselves birthed the humour in them.
