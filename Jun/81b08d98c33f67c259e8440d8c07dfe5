CAPE Town City midfielder Thato Mokeke can hardly believe he will be playing in his 100th game when the Citizens host struggling Black Leopards in their penultimate DStv Premiership match at Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday (5pm). It wasn’t an easy journey for the 30-year-old when he joined the club on loan from SuperSport United in City’s first season in the PSL top flight, after John Comitis bought the status of Mpumalanga Black Aces ahead of the 2016-17 season and hired Eric Tinkler as coach. At the end of that season, he returned to SuperSport who Tinkler had joined prior to the 2017-18 season. Tinkler was fired in March while Mokeke was released at the end of that season by the Tshwane giants. When Tinkler joined Chippa United in August 2018, and with Mokeke looking for a new club, he followed Tinkler to the Nelson Mandela Bay side. Mokeke’s stint was cut short at the Eastern Cape-based outfit and he returned to City in the second half of the 2018-19 season. He will join Thabo Nodada, Craig Martin, Thami Mkhize and Taariq Fielies, who have all played 100 games for the Mother City club. “I just want to repay the team for giving me the trust. Each and every time I step on the field I try to do my best,” said Mokeke. Mokeke, who has only missed one league game this season, was part of Tinkler’s City side that won Telkom Knockout in 2016. “I would like to thank the chairman (Comitis) for bringing me back to the team because I first came on loan here from SuperSport,” he added.
