Finally, there is clarity to the Tembisa 10 babies. According to statement released by the Tsotetsi family on Tuesday, 15 June, it seems like the babies do not exist and they have left Mzansi with a lot of questions. In the statement the family revealed that they met to discuss a report from Gosiame Sithole's boyfriend, Tebogo Tsotetsi, who revealed that he has not seen the decuplets and he relied on his girlfriend who called to inform him of their birth. The family also said Tebogo has made attempts to visit his girlfriend and the babies, but she has failed to disclose her whereabouts and the condition of their babies. "The current uncertainties and public discourse about the decuplets are of major concern to the family, especially in the absence of any proof of the decuplets existence other than telephonic and WhatAapp messages from the mother," said the family. The family has resolved and concluded that there are no decuplets born between Tebogo Tsotetsi and Gosiame Sithole, until proven otherwise and wishes to apologise for any inconvenience and embarrassment. The family also stated that they lost contact with Gosiame Sithole and with her phone off, they opened a case of a missing person. The Tsotetsi’s also emphasized that the matter remains very sensitive and worrying, especially with Gosiame Sithole's whereabouts being unknown. MediClinic also released a statement stating that Sithole was not a patient at any of their hospitals. The Steve Biko Academic Hospital CEO Dr Mathabo Mathebula, called into the Clement Manyathela show open line to also debunk the report in Pretoria News. Dr Mathebula told Clement that Sithole told hospital staff that she gave birth to the 10 children at Louis Pasteur Hospital in Pretoria and that she was told the babies would be transferred to Steve Biko Hospital.
