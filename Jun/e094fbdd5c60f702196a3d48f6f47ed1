Police arrest nine suspects linked to a taxi-related shooting in Fordsburg Johannesburg. According to SAPS spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele on Monday afternoon 14 members were notified about a shooting that had just taken place in Fordsburg. "The Highway Patrol and Crime Prevention teams were immediately deployed to search for the suspects," said Makhubele.  He said Five patrol cars belonging to the same taxi association were damaged and one person was shot and declared dead on the scene. Makhubele said the suspects did not get far because the officers were on to them and quickly spotted and stopped them. He said the police searched the suspects' car and recovered three firearms.  "The firearms will be taken for ballistic to check whether or not they may have been used in other crimes. The suspects will be charged with murder and possession of unlicensed firearms," he said. Makhubele said the suspects will further be profiled to determine whether or not they are linked to other crimes especially taxi-related violence and killings.
