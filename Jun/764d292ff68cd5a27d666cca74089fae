BAFANA Bafana avoided guest Senegal in the Cosafa Cup draw that was hed on Thursday. Bafana were drawn against three neighbours in the first round of the 2021 Cosafa Cup that will be staged in Nelson Mandela Bay from 7-18 July. Hugo Broosâ€™ side will meet Lesotho, Botswana and Eswatini in the pool stages, all games they would expect to win, with only the top team in each group automatically advancing to the knockout stages. West African guest nation Senegal have been pitted against six-times winners Zimbabwe in Group C, with the pair also up against Mozambique and Namibia, two very tricky opponents. Defending champions Zambia are in Group B and will face Malawi, as well as the island nations of Madagascar and Comoros. Malawi and Comoros have just qualified for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations and it will be a huge battle to get out of that pool. The 20th edition of the Cosafa Cup returns to the football calendar after it had to be cancelled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2021 COSAFA CUP DRAW: GROUP A South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Botswana GROUP B Zambia, Malawi, Madagascar, Comoros GROUP C Senegal, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia
