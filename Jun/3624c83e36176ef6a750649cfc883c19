The family of the lady who had 10 babies broke their silence. Speaking to eNCA, sister Mathapelo Tsotetsi said the family was very shocked but very excited. She said at first, the Dr told them that they were expecting six babies but as time went by, the Dr then told them that he's seeing eight kids. "To our surprise, 10 kids were born," said Mathapelo. When asked where the babies were born, she said they couldn't disclose that information. She also didn't confirm whether the babies were born at a public or a private hospital. "These things are scary to us so we kept it a secret," said Mathapelo. On Tuesday, 8 June, Mzansi woke up to the amazing news that a woman had given birth to 10 babies. This meant Gosiame Thamara Sithole (37) broke the world record held by Malian Halima Cisse, who gave birth to nine children in Morocco last month. Gosiame’s story appeared in the Pretoria News on Tuesday. The Gauteng health department said they have conducted thorough investigations but they still have no record of the 10 babies that were born on Monday. Thabo Mabese of the health department also said they have checked both public and private hospitals and none of them has a record of her in their hospitals. The Tsotetsi family issued a statement insisting on the birth. Ntate Tsotetsi said the family has noted and welcome public interests in the new addition and birth of 10 bundles of joy. They further confirm that the kids were born on Monday, the 7th June at about 11:00am. “We received a call from the hospital informing us of the birth. “We called back the number and got further confirmation from the mother Gosiame Sithole who was still in pain,” said Ntate. Social Development spokeswoman Feziwe Ndwayana said the mum was at a place of safety, healing and bonding with her babies.
