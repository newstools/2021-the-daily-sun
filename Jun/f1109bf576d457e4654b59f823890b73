IF it wasn’t for their warm and loving mkhukhu, madala Samson Makana (72) and gogo Rosinah Makhubela (57), believe they’d be dead by today. Their RDP house in Soshanguve extension X in Tshwane burnt down in the early hours of Saturday morning. But Samson and Rosinah were not in the house! The elderly couple decided to sleep in the backroom shack instead of their bedroom because there was load shedding and the house was too cold. Rosinah said she woke up after she couldn’t breathe. “There was smoke coming into the shack from outside,” she said. “When I went outside my heart almost stopped when I realised my house was on fire.” She said she rushed into the shack and woke Samson up. “We got buckets of water and tried to kill the fire with the help of neighbours, but the flames were too strong. “It seemed the fire started long before I could wake up. Everything was destroyed,” she said. Madala Samson said they were lucky because they hardly slept in the shack. “We would have been dead had we slept in the house. We managed to cheat death and I’m grateful for that,” he said. Ward Councillor Mokgafi Rallele said it was a mystery how the house caught fire. She said she inspected the house and all the electricity wiring were still in place and even the lights were still on. “We can’t blame the fire on electricity. We need the police to come and do a proper inspection to find the root cause of the fire,” she said. Rallele said she contacted social workers who will help the family with food and clothes. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case will be opened if the police suspect foul play but if there was no foul play, there wasn’t any way the cops could assist the couple because no crime was committed.
