FORMER president Jacob Zuma has been sentenced to 15 months imprisonment. Delivering judgment on Tuesday, 29 June acting Chief Justice Sisi Khampepe said no person was above the law. She said the Constitutional Court went to great lengths to safeguard Zuma’s rights, but he chose to continue attacking the judiciary. She further said Zuma’s disdain for the Constitutional Court and judiciary carried the risk to inspire others to defy court orders. “The majority (of judges) find themselves faced with little choice but to send a resounding message that this kind of recalcitrant and defiance is unlawful and will be punished,” said Khampepe. She added that the judiciary must rely on moral authority to fulfil its mandate. “On this basis, an unsuspended order of committal is the only appropriate sanction,” she said. The court ordered the former president to comply with the Zondo Commission summons in January, but he disobeyed the order. She said Zuma had repeatedly said he would rather be imprisoned than comply with the summons and court order. “Never before has the authority and legitimacy of the Constitutional Court been subject to the kinds of attacks that Zuma elected to launch against it and its members. Never before has the judicial process been so threatened,” she added. Zuma has been ordered to submit himself to Nkandla cop shop within five working days.
