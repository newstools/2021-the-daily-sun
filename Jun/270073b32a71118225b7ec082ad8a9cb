  IT’S the “new dawn” for Bafana Bafana. And it looks quite exciting if the early signs are anything to go by. The new-look side got off to a bright start, beating Uganda 3-2 in their International friendly played at Orlando Stadium yesterday. Evidence Makgopa announced himself in fine style in international football, bagging a second-half brace while Bongokuhle Hlongwane also bagged a goal on his debut to seal the impressive win for Bafana. Uganda’s goals, on the other hand, were scored by Ibrahim Orit in the first half and Abdul Lumala late in the match. Nevertheless, the final result would have pleased new coach Hugo Broos, who must have been keeping a close eye from his native Belgium. The 69-year-old was not on the touchline for this particular match and neither was his first assistant Cedomir Janevski. Bross is back in Europe for his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine while Janevski tested positive for the deadly virus mere hours before the match. This left local assistant Helman “Midnight Express” Mkhalele flying solo in the technical area for the first match of the new dawn for Bafana. Mkhalele was tasked with getting the best out of the youthful team on the day as the new technical team looks to young players in their quest to rebuild Bafana. Ronwen Williams, Innocent Maela and Lebohang Maboe were the only players left from the previous Bafana team that failed to qualify for the Afcon. There were as many as eight debutants in the Bafana side with the likes of Hlongwane, Rushine De Reuck, Denwin Farmer, Sibusiso Mabiliso, Nkosinathi Sibisi, Craig Martin, Ethan Brooks and Sphelele Mkhulise all making their first starts. Makgopa, arguably the most impressive of the debutants, came on in the second half and grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck.
