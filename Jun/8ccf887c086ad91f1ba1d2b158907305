The drugs, weighing 541kg with an estimated value of more than R243 million, were confiscated,” said Nkwalase. He said cops were looking for the perpetrators. Meanwhile, national head of the Hawks, Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya said: “We’re closing in on the drug cartels. This bust shows that there are organised criminal groupings involved in the movement of these dangerous substances from one country to the other. “While fighting the supply of these substances, we appeal to the community not to create demand for them, which will ultimately help in closing the market.”
