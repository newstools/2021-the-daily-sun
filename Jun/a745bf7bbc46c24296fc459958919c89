AN 18-year-old Brazilian woman has reportedly died while having sex on her wedding night. O Tempo, a Brazil-based publication, reported that the young bride died last Thursday after suffering a heart attack. Reports by the cops revealed that she collapsed while consummating her marriage with her new 29-year-old husband. “She started to feel unwell and collapsed at the couple’s home in the city of Ibirité in Brazil,” the article read. The local news outlet said the husband screamed for help, asking neighbour to call a taxi to take his wife to the hospital. A driver allegedly answered the call but refused to help them up until an ambulance was called. “The doctor found the newlywed in cardiac arrest. He intubated the patient, but she died on the spot,” O Tempo reported. The publication said local authorities were called to the scene and the neighbour told the cops that she did not hear any screams leading to the death of the bride.
