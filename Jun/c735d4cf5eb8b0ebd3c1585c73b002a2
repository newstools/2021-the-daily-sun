A LIMPOPO man who is accused of killing Precious Ramabulana (21) pleaded guilty in the Limpopo High Court on Wednesday, 9 June. Aubrey Manaka (28) pleaded guilty to charges of housebreaking, robbery, raping and murdering Precious on 24 November. In a detailed statement read by defence lawyer Lawrence Manzini before Judge Francis Kganyago, he said Manaka admitted to killing Precious by stabbing her 52 times, raping her and robbing her of her two cellphones. Manaka said he first saw Precious earlier on 23 November 2019 dancing with her friends outside her rented room while passing by. He then developed an interest in her. “Later that day I went to a tavern and in the morning of the 24 November 2019, as I was drunk, I went to the room where I saw her to propose love to Precious. But I knew she wouldn’t open for me at that time of the night, so I broke into her room.” He said she was scared and didn’t give him a chance to talk to her.

I later took her phones and went to my homestead,” he said. Manaka apologised to Precious’ family and asked them to forgive him for killing their daughter. Precious was a Public Management student at Capricorn TVET College’s Ramokgopa campus in Botlokwa. She had been renting a backroom in Ga-Joel section, Mokomene, before she was killed. Her death sent shock waves across Mzansi and saw President Cyril Ramaphosa visiting her home in Ndzelele outside Makhado, Limpopo. Manaka wasn’t a first-time offender.
