RESIDENTS of Shiney squatter camp in Mbekweni in Paarl, Western Cape, are forced to relieve themselves in plastic buckets. Resident Ludwe Jibana (27) said they’d been pleading with the municipality for proper toilets but got no response. He said the situation is made worse when residents have stomach problems as they have to climb over a concrete wall to relieve themselves. Khanyisa Mtsi (39) said she was scared the situation would lead to residents falling ill. “Relieving ourselves inside our shacks isn’t healthy, but many are forced to,” she said. Khanyisa said they wanted flushing toilets, but if that’s not possible they’d settle for portable toilets. Bonga Jibana (34) said people jump onto his roof to climb over the wall and have privacy. “At first I was angry about what they were doing, but now I understand their pain.” Bonga said there was stillno privacy because as soon as someone climbed over the wall, everyone knew they needed to go to the toilet. Gerald Esau, Executive Director: Community Services, Drakenstein Municipality said: “The current occupants invaded this piece of land after the Drakenstein Municipal Council settled another group of people on the land adjacent to it. “The invasion of this group was the subject of legal proceedings and the outcome of these proceedings are being awaited. “Once there is an outcome or once Council acknowledges this part as part of the informal settlement, the provision of services to these occupants will be revisited.
