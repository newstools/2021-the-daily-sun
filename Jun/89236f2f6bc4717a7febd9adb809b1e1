MISSING out on the Bafana Bafana squad that played against Uganda in an international friendly at Orlando Stadium last night, has been a major disappointment to Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo. Hlatshwayo was not called by new Bafana coach Hugo Broos for last night’s friendly match, with the former Cameroon coach saying the majority of the squad that failed to qualify for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals were over 30. He said his main task was to rebuild the squad. That’s why he left out many players but added the door is not closed, with 2022 World Cup qualifying starting in September. But Hlatshwayo, the Bafana captain who earned his 50th cap when the team defeated Sao Tome 4-2 in the Afcon qualifiers last year November at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, said no one is given a divine right to play for Bafana, as it is a dream for every player to represent its country. “The national team is for everyone,” said Hlatshwayo. “It’s our team. It is for me to support them. “To be called for Bafana, you need to do well for your team and I haven’t been doing well. It’s probably a wake-up call for me to work harder again to be called up again.” Hlatshwayo, who has been capped 52 times for Bafana, admitted that he has not been at his best for Orlando Pirates, whom he joined at the beginning of the season from Bidvest Wits. Hlatshwayo was at fault for both goals when Bafana lost 2-0 to Sudan in March’s Afcon vital qualifier. The defeat meant Bafana failed to qualify for the Afcon finals in Cameroon, and it led to coach Molefi Ntseki being sacked.
