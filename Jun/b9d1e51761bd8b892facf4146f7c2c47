CONGREGANTS are scared of going back to church. This after a fellow church member was shot outside the building during a prayer service on Wednesday, 16 June. A congregant told Daily Sun the incident seemed like a hit, which scared them even more. Another congregant said a few weeks ago, five suspicious men came to the church in Kagiso, Mogale City. “They looked around and when asked who they were, they left,” said the congregant. “We didn’t think something like this would happen.” The pastor said he was afraid the incident would instil fear in congregants and residents. “We had to meet on Thursday, but more than half the congregants didn’t show up. “Even though this was a robbery, many think these were hitmen. It’s going to be hard to go back to normal, but I trust God will help police find the perpetrators,” he said. Kagiso police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said cops were patrolling when they received a complaint of a shooting at the church. “Police found the body of a man lying in a pool of blood a few metres away from the door,” said Sibiya. He said congregants said they were praying when they heard gunshots outside. “Three unknown men suddenly entered the church, shooting randomly. “One man was fatally wounded and died on the scene, while another sustained gunshot wounds to the shoulder,” said Sibiya. The other man was rushed to hospital in a serious but stable condition. Sibiya said the suspects also took cellphones, handbags, laptops and Tupperware before fleeing the scene. “The motive for the attack is unknown and Kagiso police have opened a case of murder, attempted murder and business robbery.” He appealed to anyone with information to call Kagiso cop shop on 011 696 9059/9065/9067, or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
