SUPPORTERS of former eThekwini mayor and KZN legislature member Zandile Gumede insists she’s innocent of corruption charges. They say they’ll vote for her to become ANC eThekwini region chairwoman at the elective conference. Gumede’s supporters gathered outside the Durban High Court on Monday, 14 June, where she and 21 co-accused appeared on charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering. The pre-trial hearing was postponed to 30 November while the trial is expected to start on 18 July 2022. The matter was transferred from the Durban Magistrates Court in March after the state indicated the accused faced 2 786 counts. The accused, including individuals and municipal officials, allegedly plotted to irregularly get a waste removal tender worth R320 million. Prosecutor Ashika Lucken told Judge Achmat Jappie there’d been delays as some of the accused had changed legal teams and the new ones asked for information from the state. Gumede’s supporters claimed the postponement was part of a political game. Although Gumede left the court without addressing supporters, her allies addressed them. Gumede supporters’ spokesman, Ntando Khuzwayo, said it was clear their enemies were trying to confuse them so they wouldn’t vote for her at the elective conference. “We won’t back down. We’ll continue to support Gumede and we’ll vote for her in our branches. We’ll make her our chairwoman,” he said. Lindiwe Mthembu of the ANC Women’s League said they’d support Gumede because her case was being influenced by politics. “This won’t stop us from voting and supporting her,” she said.
