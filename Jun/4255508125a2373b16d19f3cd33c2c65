STUDENT organisation Cosas has called for all schools in Mzansi to shut down from Monday, 21 June. Cosas NEC member Bongani Ndlovu made the call after Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga supposedly failed to address Covid-19 issues relating to pupils. Ndlovu said: “The decision by Motshekga to utter that schools will not be closed and that teachers will be vaccinated, and not pupils, is embarrassing. “We will shut down schools starting on Monday until Motshekga comes to her senses and listens to Cosas’ call. “We want to send a strong message to our members across the country that there’s no school on Monday.” He said Motshekga was gambling with pupils’ lives, and they’d call for her removal if she didn’t stop her behaviour. “Our demand is that all pupils must be vaccinated as we can’t risk losing them to Covid-19,” he said. Parents said they supported the closure of schools until children are vaccinated. ALSO READ:

Social media was abuzz over Motshekga’s decision not to close schools. “Kids are getting infected. My son’s school alone in the past two weeks had 12 positive kids. She’s gonna kill our kids!!!”
