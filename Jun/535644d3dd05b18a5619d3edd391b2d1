MSHIYENI Mtshabane (57) doesn’t have peace knowing his son’s killers are roaming the streets. His son was allegedly killed by members of OVL gang in 2018 when he refused to join them. “I’ve been to the police station to ask about the case, but I’m not getting answers,” he said. Cops at Daveyton Police Station in Ekurhuleni keep on telling him they’re investigating. “It’s been almost three years now and the case isn’t going anywhere,” he said. Mtshabane said his son Zwelithini, then 22 was allegedly grabbed from his home by members of the OVL gang.  “My son was with his younger sister when members of the gang stormed into the house. I’m told they dragged him to the street and assaulted him.” He said Zwelithini was left for dead. Mtshabane got a call from his daughter telling him to rush home. When he got there his son had been taken to a local clinic in a taxi. “I rushed to the clinic to find nurses trying to revive him, but he’d passed away.” He said his son had open wounds indicating his killers used sharp objects like knives to kill him. Mtshabane said he’d taken it upon himself to fight for justice for his son. “It pains me because my son had plans for the future, but his life was cut short,” he said. “He was going to be an artisan and I feel like I’m failing him because his killers are roaming the streets.” Sergeant Connie Moalusi of Daveyton cop shop confirmed a case was opened but no suspects had been arrested yet.
