A SOUTH African woman could have just broken the world record by giving birth to 10 children. The current record is being held by Malian Halima Cissé, who gave birth to nine children at once. Cissé, who was expecting seven babies, instead gave birth to five girls and four boys. This while in 2009, Nadya Suleman from the USA made headlines across the world when she gave birth to eight kids – six boys and two girls – at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Centre. The babies were conceived via in vitro fertilisation and nine weeks premature when delivered by Caesarean section. The Suleman octuplets were only the second full set of octuplets to be born alive in the USA. One week after their birth, they exceeded the previous worldwide survival rate for a complete set by the Chukwu octuplets in 1998. The circumstances of their high order multiple births led to controversy in the field of assisted reproductive technology at the time, and an investigation by the Medical Board of California of the fertility specialist involved. IOL reported that the Mzansi couple had been expecting eight babies but to their surprise, doctors detected two more. People took to social media to congratulate the couple and called for big brands to give the family support. T@T5HIVHASE said: “It’s easy to understand... Bereka mogalabe, shuma. Kgotso ebe lelena. Guinness World Record.” Luckymanyuma added: “Can South Africans pull the KFC wedding saga once again, but this time with baby products and school bursaries? Guinness World Record.”
