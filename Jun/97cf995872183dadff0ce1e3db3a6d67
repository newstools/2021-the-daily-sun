JABU Mabuza was a hard worker. When he wanted to achieve something, he would not rest. Speaking at the funeral in Ermelo, Mpumalanga, Deputy President David Mabuza said Jabu was unique, very loving and also aggressive. He was speaking on behalf of Jabu’s father. “I was waiting for him to speak but I see that he is failing. I will step in. I understand why he can’t speak – because they were very close,” he said. He added that Jabu had a tendency to visit announced. He said during one visit in 1994, he came to realise that they were related. “He was very passionate about family. In fact, he made me understand myself. My parents didn’t tell me where I came from. But because of his love for family, Jabu explained it to me.” Friend Moss Gondwa said at school, Jabu was notorious and knew how to handle a knife. But as he grew up, he became a different man. “He built a R30 billion company. It shows that he had talent right from beginning.” He said Jabu was larger than life. “He loved his family to an extent that he would always find reason to celebrate every achievement, whether it was a baptism or graduation. “He would sometimes joke about it and say: ‘Eh mfo, all of them at home have degrees. I am the only one without a degree, but I have money’.” He said to his wife: “It is also hard to us. Your husband loved you with all his heart.” He said they last saw each other at Milpark Hospital. “He asked me to get medication for his wife and driver. Maybe he had a vision that he would not make it out of hospital.”
