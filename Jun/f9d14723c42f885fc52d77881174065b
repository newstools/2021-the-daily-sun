A dispute
over who should be the president of the Pan-African Parliament resulted in
chaos on Monday. On day six
of the 4th Ordinary session of the fifth Parliament things also descended into
chaos as the members of the Parliament demanded a letter from the African Union
to be read. On Monday,
at the height of the fight, ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodiena vowed to lay charges
of gender-based violence against Senegalese politician Djibril War. Majodiena
was reportedly trying to stop a physical altercation between War and a member
of the Zimbabwean delegation and then she was kicked in the process.
