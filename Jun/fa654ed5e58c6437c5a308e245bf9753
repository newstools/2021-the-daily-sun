ORLANDO Pirates defender Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo says winning only the MTN8 trophy his season was not good enough for a club of Bucs stature. Hlatshwayo joined Pirates at the beginning of the season from now defunct Bidvest Wits and was expected to help Pirates push Mamelodi Sundowns for the DStv Premiership title. But Bucs failed to challenge Downs who went on to win their fourth successive league title. However, Bucs did manage to finished third in the league which will see them again qualify for next year’s Caf Confederation Cup. “We started the season well and then I got injured and there were also other players who suffered injuries,” said Hlatshwayo. “But our goal hasn’t changed. The goal is to win the league and we will compete and we’ll fight for it next season. “As much as we did win the MTN8 trophy, I think for a team of Orlando Pirates’ calibre it is not enough, we need to do more.” Hlatshwayo did not cover himself in glory this season and at times he was at fault for a number of goals including an own goal against Swallows in the 1-1 draw. He was not at his best when Sundowns thumped Pirates 3-0 at Orlando Stadium in the league match earlier last month and again in the Soweto derby against Kaizer Chiefs when he failed to clear and Samir Nurkovic was on hand to score the winner. Hlatshwayo, who admitted his season wasn’t the best, said this will form part of the learning experience for him next season. “It has been a learning curve. Orlando Pirates are the team I grew up supporting and love,” said Hlatshwayo. “Next season, I can assure  (everyone) I will come back stronger.”
