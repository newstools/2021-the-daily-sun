BLACK Leopards striker, Ovidy Karuru, has hinted at plans of jumping out of the enclosure of the relegated Venda-side, possibly for greener PSL pastures. However, the Zimbabwean international revealed that his door is not entirely closed on Lidoda Duvha who will play in the GladAfrica Championship next season. The former Kaizer Chiefs goal-poacher has already started searching for a new club in the PSL, as his contract with Leopards expires at the end of the month. Said Karuru: “I am not going to the Championship. But you can’t close doors, if you want to play there you can because as footballers all we want is to play soccer. “When I left Chiefs I also went to play in the Championship, sometimes God sent us there to do something better and come back stronger.” Although, Karuru finished the season as the club’s joint top scorer with Zambian midfielder Roderick Kabwe on five goals, he is not happy about his overall contribution. He went on: “I was not happy with my contribution because it was not good enough to help the club survive relegation. If it was good enough, the club would still be playing in the PSL next season. We could have won a lot of games that we did well, but instead we drew them while we lost others.” Despite the setback, Karuru is confident that Leopards will bounce back to the land of milk and honey. “The club has a lot of good quality players and they need to work extra hard to ensure they return to the PSL at the end of next season. This is a very good team and we were just unlucky to get relegated.”
