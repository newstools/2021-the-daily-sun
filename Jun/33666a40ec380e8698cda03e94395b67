CAPE Town City FC coach, Eric Tinkler, has already started preparing for the coming season by first laying out his plans on the bench. He told owner, John Comitis, how he wants his technical team to look like for next season. Tinkler recently re-joined City, replacing Dutch mentor Jan Olde Riekerink, whom the club fired for poor results. With Tinkler back at City, reports have been making rounds that former Bafana Bafana captain Aaron Mokoena, the current assistant coach, could leave the Mother City-based club. Mokoena was brought to City as an assistant to Riekerink. As is often the case with new coaches, Tinkler is expected to bring in his technical team, which would see Mokoena vacating the assistant coach position before starting the new season. However, Tinkler remained cagey when asked about possible changes in his technical team. He said: “This is the decision that will be made by the club. I have given them my opinion on what the technical team should look like. But ultimately the decision always lies with the club.” Tinkler was in charge of the last two City league matches, and he managed to get three points as he won one match, beating relegated Black leopards 3-1 and lost 3-0 to league champions Mamelodi Sundowns on the final day. They finished in position seven with 41 points from 30 matches. The coach said he had seen the players, but there would be slight changes next season and confirmed that the club would sign not more than three players for the 2021-22 season. Tinkler stated: “There is a specific way I would want to play the game next season. I do not want to make big changes but certain elements in terms of how I want us to play, and I have identified which players suit that. “We have already been stating that we planning to bring in three new faces. In terms of players to release, we are still going to discuss that and at this stage I do not want to divulge much.”
