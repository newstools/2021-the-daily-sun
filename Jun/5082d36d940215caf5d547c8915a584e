THE Constitutional Court has sentenced former president Jacob Zuma to 15 months in jail for contempt of court. Zuma has five days to hand himself over to the police or get arrested, as acting Chief Justice Sisi Khampepe instructed in the judgment. But Msholozi’s son, Edward Zuma, said they would have to kill him first before his father would get arrested at his Nkandla home. “Whatever decision law enforcement agencies decide upon, if that drastic decision is taken, they will have to pass through me first. I will lay down my life for Zuma,” he said. Speaking to Newzroom Afrika, Zuma said: “You must expect worse than you have been witnessing in the past months or year. We appreciate the support and encourage people to come in their numbers to support Zuma.” When asked about Covid-19 restrictions, he said: “What about Covid-19 restrictions? You know we are in a situation of war. We can’t be considering Covid-19. If it means we die, we die.”
