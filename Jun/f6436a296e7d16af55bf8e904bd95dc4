MASKANDI artist uGlama ka Maskandi is livid. This after Ukhozi FM cut her song Bayesaba. The song was playing on Sya Mhlongo and Selbyonce’s afternoon drive show when Sya decided to stop it. Part of the song goes: “Wasuza nogwaja, washipha kewu, wandiza swayini” (The geese and rabbit are farting and the swine is flying). Sya reasoned that the song was full of insults and couldn’t be played. He said: “No Glama, your song has insults.” But uGlama said what happened was not fair. “I don’t understand the actual problem because this song has been played a number of times on Sigiya Ngengoma and there were no issues. “My fans like it and never complained about it. But this presenter decided to cut it on his show. If the song wasn’t suitable for their show or SABC, they should have informed me,” said uGlama.

I will contact them once I’m back in Durban. I’m sure we can resolve this,” she said. Gugu Ntuli, SABC group executive for corporate affairs and marketing, confirmed that the song was cut. In a brief statement, she said: “It must be noted that presenters are empowered and expected to pick up content in music that is not radio-friendly. “They are expected to take responsible action by stopping the song and making an on-air disclaimer or apology. At this stage, the station will deal with this matter directly with the artist.”
