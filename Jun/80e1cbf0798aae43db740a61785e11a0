The point is, steaming was and continues to be a part of our lifestyle. But have you ever considered steaming your punani? If you had to think about it, think no more because according to Healthline magazine, vaginal steaming is great for your health. According to the publication, vaginal steaming is an age-old natural remedy said to cleanse the vagina and uterus, regulate menstruation, and ease period cramps and bloating. It directs herb-infused steam into your punani. You can also do this at home, although most doctors don’t recommend it. The process is pretty simple – you just sit or squat over a container of herbal-infused steam. Popular herbs one can use include mugwort, wormwood and chamomile. The magazine says steaming also relieves stress, depression, infections, headaches, fatigue and digestive issues.
