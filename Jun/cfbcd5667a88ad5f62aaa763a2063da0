THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) says the league is unlikely to replace the Telkom Knockout next season due to a cramped schedule brought in by Covid-19 pandemic. PSL acting CEO Mato Madlala said there are potential sponsors who have approached them, but their challenge is that South African teams are now reaching knockout stages of either the Caf Champions League or Confederation Cup, which makes it difficult for them to schedule games, resulting in postponing many matches. The telecommunication company ditched the PSL at the end of last season after 14 years of association, as it couldn’t renew the sponsorship deal. PSL chairman Irvin Khoza confirmed, when this ended season started in October last year, that they won’t have a top flight 16-team competition in 2020-21 season because it was too late. “You the media write that the PSL doesn’t give our clubs sufficient time to prepare when they play in Africa, but we cramped them,” said Madlala. “As you all can see, it is very tight because of Covid-19. “When these teams leave the country, they have to test for Covid-19 in the country and also when they arrive in the country they are playing in before they can play. “So the days become stretched. Sometimes you find that airlines are not operating. “Sometimes they go to Egypt; they fly via Ethiopia and wait for 24 hours for the connection flight. So spending those days away makes scheduling of fixtures impossible. “As much as we want money, and possibilities are there, but right now with the issue of Covid, it is impossible to have it and still give our teams a chance to compete on the continent.” Mamelodi Sundowns were the last team to win this league cup in 2019 when they defeated Maritzburg United 2-1 in the final in Durban.
