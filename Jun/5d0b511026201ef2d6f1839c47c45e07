Gqom singer, Moonchild Sanelly has her head set on making the world a better and cleaner place as she wants to create a biodegradable wig line. To make her dream come true, the Thunda Thighs hitmaker entered Dazed100. The Dazed100 is a global celebration of people who are leading change across communities or in their fields. The winner will be awarded $30 000 (R427 962). Moonchild is nominated alongside people from around the world and she said she wants to empower South African women through the wig line she’ll start, should she win. “I applied because I know that having skills with your hands doesn’t limit where you go. It’s a real-life story for me. I used to carry my sewing machine around and make money. And as a designer, I know I can survive without a job and I want other people to know that as well,” she told Daily Sun.

And I want to have women who have the skill of sewing and I also want to teach women the skill so I can create jobs. That way, I’m changing the paths of many, I’m enriching them and reminding them that the power is in their hands. They will also be able to make a living for themselves,” she said. Moonchild said she has always wanted to do this and has big dreams for it. “My ultimate goal as a fashion designer is to have an organisation where I go to schools and teach grade 11s and 12s, especially the ones in rural areas about the work they can do with their hands. I just want to empower them and remind them that the future is in their hands,” said the singer. She said even if she doesn’t win the competition, she’ll still work towards making the wig line a success. The singer said people can vote for her on the Dazed website.
