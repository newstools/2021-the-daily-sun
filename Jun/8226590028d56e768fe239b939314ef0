SIVUTSA Stars will be hoping to use home ground advantage and return to the professional ranks in the upcoming ABC Motsepe League national play-offs. Mpumalanga, (Kanyamazane and Kabokweni Stadiums) will host the nine-team tournament, which will start on Monday until 3 July, where the champions will be crowned. The Mpumalanga-based club was promoted to the First Division back in the 2011-12 season. However, in 2014 the club relocated to Durban as it was sold to Shauwn and S’bu Mpisane, who renamed it to Royal Eagles. Having won the Motsepe League in Mpumalanga, Sivutsa will give another shot to return to NFD, now known as GladAfrica Championship. Sivutsa was drawn in Group B alongside Gauteng Champions Leruma United and Northern Cape Champs Hungry Lions. Group A consists of Mangaung United, Umvoti, Glendene United, while Group C has City Rovers, BCM Stars, and The Dolphins. The winners of the three groups will be joined by the best-placed runners-up in the semi-finals, with both finalists gaining automatic promotion to the Championship, where they will replace relegated Bizana Pondo Chiefs and Steenburg United. Champions will walk away with a trophy and a whopping R1 million prize money, while the runners-up will collect a purse of R500 000. Last season Pondo Chiefs and Pretoria Callies reached the finals – both were promoted to the First Division. In the final, Bizana edged Callies 5-4 on penalties to claim the whopping price of R1 million after playing to a goalless draw in regular time. The PSL is yet to announce the starting date of the 2021-21 season.
