TEMBISA tavern owners in Ekurhuleni have heeded the call to comply with tighter Covid-19 regulations. On Tuesday, 22 June, about 100 tavern owners attended a workshop hosted by Liquor Traders Association at Soltjhile Pub and Restaurant in the area. The workshop was aimed at better equipping traders with knowledge on how they could protect themselves and their patrons, as well as complying with the ever-changing regulations. But Mable Sithole from Kaalfontein told Daily Sun they have not recovered from last year’s hard lockdown. She said they were now living from hand to mouth. “I just think of more liquor restrictions when I hear there will be an address by the president,” she said. Johannes Dlamini conceded that some traders were now following protocols. But he admitted that social distancing was non-existent in some taverns. Johannes said they hoped government gave them some sort of grant. Philemon Mojela, president of the SA Liquor Traders Association, said: “Liquor traders have a tendency to take chances and avoid compliance. We now have a problem now that infection numbers are going up in Gauteng and across South Africa, so we must do something. We need people to comply. Some of them are under the illusion the closing time is 10pm, while they are supposed to close at 9pm.” He said they got this information from law enforcement as they move around patrolling at night. He said the association focused on educating liquor traders on the Liquor Act and on Covid-19 compliance almost every fortnight. He said they have seen improved changes since they started with the workshops.
