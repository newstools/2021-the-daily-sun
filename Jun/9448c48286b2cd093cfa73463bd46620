COPS are looking for two suspects in connection with a hijacking that happened on 23 March. Captain Solomon Sibiya said the two suspects allegedly called the victim claiming to be from a tracker installation company and hijacked him in Kagiso in Krugersdorp, west of Joburg. “They told him they wanted to install a tracker on his car,” he said. The suspects were driving a Corsa bakkie and one was wearing a blue shirt with Netstar branding. Captain Sibiya said after meeting the victim, one of the suspects took a tool box out of their vehicle and put it inside the victim’s red BMW with registration number DY73GLGP. “The suspect then asked to test drive the BMW. A few minutes later the other suspect convinced the victim he was going to buy cooldrink at a nearby shop. They never returned,” he said. Police appealed to anyone with information about the suspects’ whereabouts to call investigating officer Sergeant Tebogo Mokhitli on 011 696 9000/9059/9065/9067. Tips can also be given on the CrimeStop line on 08600 10111 or sent to the MySAPS app. Tips can be given anonymously. SunReaders with information can also call investigating officer Sergeant Humphrey Mokhitli on 083 623 9638. Netstar’s Pierre Bruwer said there was a similar incident six months previously. He urged people to call the company if they had doubts.
