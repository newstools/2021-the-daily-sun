PUPILS from several schools in Mankweng outside Polokwane, Limpopo were left hungry recently. This after a group of people invaded several schools and kicked pots and scattered mealie meal and soup meant to feed pupils. They allegedly attacked the schools over tenders. The affected schools include Motholo Primary School, Makgwadiba Higher Primary School and Ditlalemeso Secondary School. According to sources, some of the people who terrorised the schools for tenders are members of Motswikitswiki, a community organisation, which is against crime and drugs. Motswikitswiki member Juda Rakobela confirmed that some of the people behind the shocking incident were members of the organisation. But he said the incident was not what they planned. He said although their members were wrong, they would remain members of the organisation. “This is because we believe that when one has sinned, they should be disciplined,” said Juda.
