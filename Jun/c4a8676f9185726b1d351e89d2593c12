According to a urologist, daily practices and behaviours play a key role in how manhood is affected. Dr Jamin Brahmbhatt, professor of urology at UCF College of Medicine in the United States, has shared key elements that keep his 4-5 working fine without any problems. Online publication, Men’s Health, has compiled the following five key ways to keep the 4-5 healthy as shared by Dr Brahmbhatt: 1. Get Your Blood Flowing Dr Brahmbhatt encourages the gents to exercise at least three times a week, either running or lifting. He said this helps keep your blood vessels flexible and healthy, especially in the 4-5, which has some of the smallest vessels in the body. 2. Circumcise He calls this a strategic cut and advises men not to be afraid of it. ALSO READ: WHAT TYPE OF BREASTS DO MEN LIKE? “I was circumcised as an adult. Chronic dry skin meant cracking in the foreskin, and it became a problem to be hygienic no matter what kinds of creams and lotions I tried,” Dr Brahmbhatt said. 3. Distinguish Between Fact and Fantasy The urologist said he’s concerned about how porn may leave many thinking their 4-5 size and stamina are inadequate. He advises men that the average erect 4-5 is five inches and that healthy 4-5s capable of great sex come in all sizes. 4. Check Your Stream: Consult with the doctor to check if your urine stream does not have problems. 5. Give Things a Rest: Try to get enough sleep as it allows the body to rest and rebalance. Dr Brahmbhatt said lack of sleep can cause testosterone levels to drop, which suppresses one’s desire and ability to have an erection.
