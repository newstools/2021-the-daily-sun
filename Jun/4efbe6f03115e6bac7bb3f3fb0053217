MPUMALANGA Human Settlements MEC Speedy Mashilo has criticised the illegal occupation of land by residents. He said this undermined government efforts. Mashilo was speaking to the community of Ga-Nala, formerly known as Kriel, near Emalahleni recently. The residents were protesting for land and houses. “The urgent need for land can’t be over emphasised, but illegal land occupation hampers our planning and the drive to eradicate informal settlements. “People who need land and houses should register with the local municipality,” he said. “This will help government to address the actual backlog for stands as well as improve planning and land acquisition.” Mashilo told the angry community the department received approval from Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act for Ruitkuil Farm. “The approval of the farm means the township establishment must begin very soon. Illegal land invasion and violence isn’t a very good way of acquiring sustainable and habitable land. “The department has already finalised township establishment processes and the township has been proclaimed,” he said. “It’s expected that said township will see a yield of at least 5 000 stands. This will bring relief to the housing and stands backlog in the area.” Mashilo said the department planned to acquire 13 pieces of land over the medium term strategic framework 2019 to 2024. The department had already bought eight pieces of land for human settlement. “The department’s new approach is to focus on the quick release of land by servicing stands and encouraging beneficiaries to build for themselves.”
