THE Lilongwe Magistrates Court ruled that Mzansi witnesses in the extradition hearing of Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his wife, Mary, will have to travel to Malawi to testify. This after the state made an application to the magistrate on Friday, 4 June, to have South African witnesses testify virtually. Chief Resident Magistrate, Patrick Chirwa, said there was no legal basis for the request to have witnesses appear on video. He said the law was very clear that witnesses must come to Malawi and testify under oath.  The fugitives from justice appeared briefly in court on Tuesday, 8 June, for the court ruling. Hundreds of their supporters came to court. Bushiri said he and his wife are continuing their journey to seek justice. On Friday, Bushiri said claims by witnesses that there were no available flights and that they feared Covid-19 were untrue.  “Both governments in question have put in place Covid-19 measures that have ensured the safe travels of citizens for the past months. For three years they failed to bring witnesses through to testify against my wife and I and today they have done the same thing,” said Bushiri. The Enlightened Christian Gathering Church leaders fled Mzansi to their home country Malawi in November after they were granted bail, claiming they were not safe in South Africa.  Malawi Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Steve Kayuni said the court
order would be respected. He said arrangements have to be made. "Discussions have to be had
to ensure that the order of the court is duly accordingly taken." "We requested  six weeks to arrange for the appearance of the
witnesses," he said.
