KORRIE Louw has been missing for decades and his brother Mpho is looking for him. Andrew, who was born on 15 April 1960, apparently left home in 1982 and hasnâ€™t been heard from since. His mum is now old and sickly and wants him to come see her. Anyone who has information must please help them. Her number is 081 324 1766.
