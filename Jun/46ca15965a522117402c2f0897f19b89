Mandla Ncikazi has found a new home. The former Golden Arrows has joined Orlando Pirates after leaving the KwaZulu Natal club earlier this week. The Soweto giants confirmed Ncikazi’s appointment on their official Twitter page on Friday afternoon. “Orlando Pirates Football Club is pleased to announce the appointment of Mandla Ncikazi,” the club said in a statement on its website. “The 52-year-old joins the Bucs technical team department on a three-year deal.” Ncikazi shocked the football fraternity when he left his role as Arrow’s coach recently after helping the club achieve their highest ever finish in the DStv Premiership. They finished fourth with 47 points from 30 matches, only three points behind his new club Pirates. Ncikazi revealed he was delighted to join the Sea Robbers. “I am pleased to be here and look forward to getting started,” said Ncikazi. Meanwhile, Bucs are reportedly in discussions to lure Steve Komphela from Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns. Komphela is said to be top of the list of potential successors to Josef Zinnbauer, whose future at the club remains uncertain. Ncikazi and the rest of the Bucs technical team as well as the players are scheduled to start preseason on July 1.
