LAND invaders moved into the bushy terrain to erect their shacks but left the open plot of land next to it alone. None of them dared to touch the land although it was easy to erect shacks on it as compared to the nearby areas that had to be cleared from the vegetation. A resident who stays in Covid-19 squatter camp in the Bosasa area in Mfuleni, Cape Town, told the SunTeam the land is a no-go area because it’s izangoma turf. “Every day, especially at night, you see them carrying buckets and clay pots going to this place together with their clients,” said Mlondolozi Ciya (43). “People didn’t touch the land because they saw what was happening there.” He said people know the place is used by izangoma to help people. A newly settled resident, Sabelo Sigiva (34), said some group of people had planned to put up shacks on the land but changed their minds. “We see izangoma on the land. I suspect they do rituals to remove bad luck from people. “Nobody wants to put a shack on that land as they fear spirits izangoma take from their clients.” Sangoma Koleka Mabentsela (53) said she was grateful that people were sparing the place. “I’ve been a sangoma for the past 20 years, and that’s the place we use to cleanse our clients. I use it for rituals every month,” she said. “There is a river close by and there are rituals that require a client to throw something into moving water.”
