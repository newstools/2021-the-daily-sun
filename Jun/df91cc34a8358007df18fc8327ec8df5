FOOTBALL players often fall on hard times once they retire. But Denis Onyango will not battle to keep the wolf from the door once he hangs up his gloves. The Mamelodi Sundowns number 1 goalkeeper is going into farming. Onyango was honoured with a piece of land back home in Uganda after he became the country’s first player to win the Caf Champions League in 2016. He is already putting the land to good use pigs. “I plan to do farming with the land that I have,” said Onyango. “I’ve got a few pigs there already. My brother is looking after them. But you know, it’s a lot of work. I mean pigs make lots of babies. “I want to look after my farm after I retire. Life is difficult after football. I’m grateful for the land that they’ve given him. I’m hoping it becomes bigger and bigger. “The land has opened my eyes to things that can help me after retirement.” Onyango is one of the most valuable goalkeepers in the country. He recently on the PSL Goalkeeper of the Season award.
