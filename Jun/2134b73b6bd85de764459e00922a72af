POLICE have arrested a man (43) found in possession of stolen laptops and computer boxes. Captain Augustinah Selepe said the man, found with 22 laptops and nine computer boxes, was arrested by crime prevention police on Thursday in the Tshwane CBD. Selepe said: “Members of crime prevention received anonymous information about a man who buys and sells stolen laptops, computer boxes and cellphones at an electronics shop situated at the corner of Central and Pretorius streets in the CBD.” Police followed up on information which led to the discovery of laptops and computer boxes with serial numbers filed off. The suspect failed to produce a trading certificate and purchase invoices. “He’s expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court soon on charges of possession of stolen property,” said Selepe. Pretoria Central station commander, Brigadier Moses Dladla, encouraged the public to provide information to police.
