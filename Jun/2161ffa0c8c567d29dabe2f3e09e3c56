IT seems there’s no neighbourly love between Zukiswa Hlakaza and her neighbour. As she’s blind, Zukiswa expected to receive warmth from her neighbour, Sonto Mathe. But her neighbour allegedly wants her lover. The 53-year-old from Clayville near Ivory Park said her neighbour is jealous that her lover looks after her. She’s allegedly questioning why her man is sticking with a blind woman. “She says I gave him korobela because he doesn’t want to leave,” she said. Zukiswa said her life is hell. “She’s doing everything to separate us by spreading all sorts of lies about me. “I want her to leave us alone. I didn’t give my husband korobela as she thinks. I’m just lucky he’s dedicated to his family,” she said. Zukiswa said her life is in danger as the woman is relentless. “I’m left alone when my lover leaves for work and my kids leave for school,” she said. Her lover Lucky Mkhabela said he was aware a neighbour allegedly wanted him. “I have seven children with Zukiswa and she respects me,” said Lucky. He said he was going to stick with Zukiswa and his kids. But Sonto denied wanting Zukiswa’s husband. “We do have some differences, but I don’t want her husband,” she said. The couple have been together since 1997. Zukiswa’s eyesight was okay until 2007 when she mysteriously went blind two months after giving birth. She said doctors told her it was glaucoma, which affected her nerves and she may never see again. “I’ve learnt to accept my situation, but people are a nuisance and don’t want to leave me alone.”
