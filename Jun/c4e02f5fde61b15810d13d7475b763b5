ACTORS Connie and Shona Ferguson will launch a foundation to help empower disadvantaged people. The foundation will be launched with a black tie fund-raising gala dinner at Houghton Hotel in Joburg on 26 June. It will focus on women empowerment, scholarships, entrepreneurship and education. Both Connie and Shona were unavailable for comment, but Solomzi Mabaleka, the executive director of the foundation, spoke on their behalf. He told Daily Sun the foundation aimed to help as many people as they could. “The aim of the foundation is to rebuild our economy, restructure our communities and ultimately build future industry leaders,” said Solomzi.

He said the foundation has already started working and they planned to adopt a soccer team. “So far, the foundation has been tirelessly trying to build relationships and collaborations with stakeholders whose business objectives and strategies are aligned with ours. “Last week, the Ferguson Foundation went out to Emdeni in Soweto, to meet Emdeni FC and be acquainted with them. “Our goal is to adopt the football club and have them under the foundation’s wing,” said Solomzi. Applications for the programmes will open on 1 July. “The selection process as to who qualifies is going to be tough and intense, as we cannot offer assistance to everyone. Applications will be reviewed with the utmost care and consideration,” he told the People’s Paper.
