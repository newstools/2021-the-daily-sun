department made the announcement on Thursday, in light of the third wave of the
Covid-19 pandemic. Gauteng

502 in the last 24 hours. "This
has put our healthcare facilities under extreme pressure," the department

will be expected to pre-arrange the visit and be authorised by the attending
doctor. "All
must screen for temperature and Covid-19 symptoms," the department added. SOURCE:
