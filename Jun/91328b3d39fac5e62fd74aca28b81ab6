DRIVING in Jozi is one of the most stressful activities and requires thick skin. In Joburg, even if the robot gives you the green light you cannot just go ahead and drive as motorists tend to skip red lights. In a recent incident, two taxis crashed after one of them seemed to have skipped a red robot. In the video, a blue and white Toyota Siyaya and a Quantum can be seen crashing in the middle of an intersection, and the Quantum lands on its side. As the crash happened, the driver of the Siyaya can be seen being flung out of the taxi onto the road. Following that, the man stands up and looks at the Siyaya as it continues to drive until it crashes into a shop. Instead of going to check if the people in the other taxi are alright, he makes a run for it, leaving the scene of the incident.
