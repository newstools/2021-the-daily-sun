The language of love is articulated and expressed in three ways: touching, sex and kissing. While the most popular of the three is sex, we often play down the importance of kissing as a sign of affection. According to a survey done by the State University of New York at Albany, the majority of people will straight up end a relationship because of a bad kiss, with 59% of them being men and 66% being women. A similar study conducted by Oxford University suggested that kissing is a way for us to size up potential partners, as well as a way to keep long-term relationships together. So, how do you master the art of kissing? Bustle magazine shares some tips for you: 1. Keep Your Lips Moisturised Make a point of prepping your lips before a kiss by applying lip balm. If you don’t have any on hand, sip some water to quickly moisten your lips. 2. Avoid Pungent Foods Skip smelly foods like garlic, raw onions, cabbage, broccoli and excessive coffee and liquor, especially whiskey. 3. Follow Your Partner’s Lead Remember that it’s all about compromise, especially if you and your partner don’t have the same technique. Not everyone kisses the same way, which is why it’s often a matter of meeting in the middle. 4. There’s More to Kissing Than Just Lips Kissing is about the neck, the ear lobes, the collarbone, the cheeks, and maybe a bit of playbiting. When kissing, think about all these aspects in your partner and explore.
