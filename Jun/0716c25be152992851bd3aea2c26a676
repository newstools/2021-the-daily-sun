As the country continues to battle the Covid-19 pandemic, let’s all be mindful of our roles. To this effect, we need to adhere to all safety measures in order for us to push back the frontiers of this very deadly virus. On this note, let me expose the level of carelessness displayed by commercial banks. It’s a given fact that money drives the world, and therefore people will always go all out to get money. This means that those who have their money in banks will at some point need to withdraw it so they can use it. It ruffles feathers that, with the exception of Absa, other commercial banks don’t have sanitisers at their ATMs. This means any person who may have contracted the virus and goes on to use an ATM, may pass it to other users. At the end of the month, or on days when social grants are paid, there are long queues at the ATMs. I find it utterly irresponsible of banks not to prioritise the safety of their customers during a time when every citizen is told to stay safe. Let’s all play our part to curb the spread of Covid-19. - Letter by Malphia Honwane - Gottenburg, eManyeleti
