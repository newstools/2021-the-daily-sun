MARCIA Ramodike has a story to tell, and this can only be done through a book. The 24-year-old author from Lenyenye township in Tzaneen, Limpopo, recently launched her book From an Empty Pride To a Full Price. She said the book tackled the issue of black tax in Mzansi. It takes the reader through the journey of how parents expected their kids to give back to their families, especially after graduating. “The book speaks to young people, their financial situations, the importance of mental health and how they can give back without putting themselves in any jeopardy,” said Marcia. She told Daily Sun that lessons from her upbringing inspired her to pen the book. “I saw the need to help at home after I lost my mother seven years ago when I was just 18. “I was tasked with the challenge of mothering my two siblings with the help of my grandmother.” Marcia said losing her mum was the hardest thing to have ever happened to her. “What I learnt over the years is that when one is faced with difficulties, we should go for therapy. We should not feel pity for ourselves because nothing will change.” She said that the situation made her realise we could improve our communities and families when faced with difficulties such as the death of the breadwinner and unemployment. “The book’s title is a message for young people to stay humble and give back to their communities and those in need. It’s important to honour and respect where we come from,” she said. Marcia said black tax could be managed when we didn’t let our parents dictate to us what we should do for them. “We can have open discussions about our financial plans and situations, and make everyone understand them. “We need to stand up for ourselves because failure to do so will drag us into depression, and we will suffer the pain of prioritising others’ happiness while we die inside,” she told the People’s Paper.
