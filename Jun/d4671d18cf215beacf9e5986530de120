MAMELODI Sundowns have set another club record! The Brazilians played 15 away matches without a defeat. This comes after they defeated Bloemfontein Celtic 2-0 at Dr Molemela Stadium last night. The league champions are the only team that did not lose a match when playing away this season. They recorded ten victories and played five draws, accumulating a tally of 32 points on the road. Last night Peter Shalulile continued with his impressive form since joining Mamelodi Sundowns from Highlands Park. The Namibian international scored a brace to increase his goals tall to 13 this season. The newly crowned PSL Champions got off to a perfect start as Shalulile opened the scoring on the 11th minute of the match with a fine after following up on Hashim Domingoâ€™s strike, which struck the crossbar. Celtic tried to push for an equaliser, but veteran goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene was on his feet, ensuring Downs keep a clean sheet in the first half. Shalulile extended the lead in the 65th minute with another header from a corner kick which left Celtic goalkeeper Mondli Mpoto with no chance. They were a couple of chances after that, but both sides could not find the back of the net as Sundowns emerged victorious. Sundowns coaches Manqoba Mngqithi, Rulani Mokwena, and Steve Komphela handed a rare start to Domingo in the absence of Themba Zwane. In contrast, Mweene started on the goals in place of Reyaad Pieterse, who had started in their last game when they drew 0-0 with Swallows FC. Sundowns have now recorded 64 points. The defeat means Celtic will miss out in next season MTN8 as they will finish the current campaign outside the top eight. Heading to final league games at the weekend, Celtic are in position 11 with 31 points. They were leapfrogged by Kaizer Chiefs, who moved to position nine after beating Golden Arrows 3-2 at FNB Stadium.
