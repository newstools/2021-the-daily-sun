IEC chief electoral officer Sy Mamabolo made his oral submission to the Moseneke Inquiry on Monday, 28 June about free and fair elections during Covid-19. He’s the first stakeholder to make his submission in the inquiry chaired by former deputy chief justice, Dikgang Moseneke. Mamabolo said every citizen who’s entitled to vote should be registered and no person who isn’t entitled to vote should be allowed to. Registration of voters must be done in such a way as to ensure only voters in that area are registered and permitted to vote in municipal elections. “Political parties and candidates should be able to compete with one another on relatively equal terms,” he said. He said voters should have access to reliable information about the election, and parties and candidates contesting must be able to vote free from intimidation. Mamabolo asked that the commission apply relevant electoral laws to all participants, without fear or favour, and to ensure all participants compete without any undue hindrance. He said Covid-19 voting protocols have been adjusted since level 1 as new lessons are learnt. Current protocols are that when voting starts the presiding officer must defog the voting station venue. Voting officers will be provided with PPE for use at the voting station and during special votes and home visits. Pens provided by the commission will be sanitised after each use. All voters in the queue must adhere to lockdown rules. The inquiry is expected to continue throughout the week. Stakeholders who’re expected to make their submissions include medical experts, electoral monitoring bodies and civil society organisations.
