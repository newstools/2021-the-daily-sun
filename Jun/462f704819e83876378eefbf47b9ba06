CAPE Town City star Mduduzi Mdantsane is aiming high next season! The 26-year-old midfielder has set himself two goals. Firstly, Mdantsane wants to see the Citizens challenge for trophies starting with the MTN8 where they are set to face their former coach Benni McCarthy’s AmaZulu. Secondly, the former Baroka captain is aiming to play regularly for Bafana Bafana and try to help them qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Last season, the Leandro-born star had a fine season netting nine goals in 28 league matches. He ended the season as the club’s joint-leading goal scorer with midfielder Fagrie Lakay. “I think I had a good season as I managed to avoid injuries as that had been a problem for me when I joined City in 2019,” said Mdantsane. “I am pleased with my contribution to the team as we qualified for the MTN8. But I want to do better next season. I have goals I want to fight to achieve next season. I want to play for my country and see City challenge for trophies. “You can achieve anything in life if you work hard and be disciplined. The good thing for me is that I am surrounded by teammates who also work hard all the time and dream big for this club.” Mdantsane was also delighted with the club for reappointing Bafana legend Eric Tinkler as their new head coach, succeeding Dutchman Jan Olde Riekerink. “Tinkler is a well known coach and a legend of the game in South Africa,” explained. “He (Tinkler) knows local football well. I am happy to be coached by him as he will help to guide me on what it takes to play for Bafana as he has been there for many years. I can’t wait for next season.” Tinkler, who won the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations with Bafana, has coached the likes of Orlando Pirates, SuperSport United, Chippa United and Maritzburg United. The 50-year-old retired with 45 caps for Bafana.
