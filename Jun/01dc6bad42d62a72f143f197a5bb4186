AKUTHWASWA online, never! These were the words of angry izangoma, who spoke to Daily Sun after a video of a woman claiming to help people with ukuthwasa online went viral. Cultural expert Mgobhozi Vuma said that this was a mockery of African culture. “Most of the time, ancestors show you where they want you to thwasa. I don’t think there are ancestors who will show you a laptop and tell you that’s where you will thwasa.” The woman in the video says: “If you want ukuthwasa but you don’t want to be at a gobela’s place, we have ukuthwasa online.” She says there are five amagobongo, which are the first steps to fixing your spirits. “We have stage two where a person takes igobongo ledlozi and stage three where we give you igobongo lomlozi. That’s when you already have idlozi and all that’s left is for it to be woken up.” The amagobongo, according to the woman, are sent via courier followed by an online workshop that teaches how to use them as well as how to use traditional muthi for idlozi. Sangoma Skhunisivuthemanzini Mkhize told Daily Sun there were things that could be done online, but not ukuthwasa. “Someone who undergoes ukuthwasa faces a lot of hardships during the process. They need proper guidance from a gobela who has been there before,” said Mkhize. He said sometimes when idlozi arrives, it will make the person faint, or even violent. “Gobelas know which muthi to use to calm idlozi.” Sangoma Jabulani Mthimunye said online ukuthwasa is a no-no! “When someone is at training, things happen. Sometimes the gobela has to wake up in the middle of the night and start singing and playing the drums to help the trainee,” said Mthimunye. “If the trainee is at home, how will they be assisted when such arise? This won’t work.” Cultural expert Mgobhozi Vuma said: “Let us not try and be part of every new fashion.”
