COPS have been patrolling Zandspruit after a mob attacked and killed residents last month. On 12 June, cops were in the area, which impressed Masana Mabasa. The 25-year-old resident jokingly told the police: “At least Bheki Cele is working this time.” But cops didn’t take this kindly and Masana paid dearly for his utterances. “One officer said ‘wa ntolobela,’ then slapped and pepper-sprayed me,” said Masana. He said he ran into his brother-in-law’s yard to wash his face, but the police followed him. Masana was allegedly slapped, kicked in the face and body until he fainted. He said he woke up in hospital. “I can’t walk properly. Doctors told me two of my ribs are broken,” he said. Masana said he was only trying to commend the cops for patrolling the area. He was admitted to hospital on 12 June and discharged the next day. He’s now recovering at home. His mum, Dolly (43), said she wanted the police to pay for what they did to her son. A resident said: “We saw it all. Masana was not fighting them and they even followed him inside the yard to slap and kick him. It was bad.” Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokeswoman Ndileka Cola said the case was being investigated.
