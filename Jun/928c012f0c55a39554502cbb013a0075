IT was six years ago this week  when Sepp Blatter stepped down from his position as Fifa president. His resignation sent shock waves through the footballing world, the then 79-year-old succumbing to pressure intensified by Fifa’s corporate partners, as well as from various Fifa members as a result of a corruption scandal. Blatter, who was instrumental in South Africa winning the rights to host the 2010 World Cup, delivered his resignation speech to a mostly empty room at Fifa headquarters, just a month after he was re-elected for the fourth time. His decision had followed a dramatic sequence of events that began with a police raid at a five-star hotel, where seven soccer officials were arrested and held for extradition to the United States on corruption charges. “Fifa needs a profound restructuring,” Blatter said. “Although the members of FIFA have given me the new mandate, this mandate does not seem to be supported by everybody in the world of football.” After finishing his prepared speech, Blatter disappeared through a door without taking questions from the few reporters who were able to attend the speech, which was given on short notice. Seven months later, Gianni Infantino was elected Fifa president at the 69th congress held in Paris. The election remained more relevant for South Africans after Tokyo Sexwale ran for the office, although he dramatically withdrew at the last minute, announcing he was a “candidate of peace” to bring everybody together and chart a new path for the world governing body. He remarked: “If Gianni wins it will be a party. If Jerome wins it will be a party. If Sheikh Salman wins it will be a party. If Prince Ali wins it will be a party. But if I win, it will be a greater party!”
