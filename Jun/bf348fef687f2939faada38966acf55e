A SECURITY guard was kidnapped from work on 3 April. After his disappearance, cops asked Daily Sun to publish his photo. Lucky Maake (38) was found buried in a shallow grave three weeks later, not far from the mine he worked at. But no one was arrested. Krugersdorp cops worked around the clock to trace suspects after following up leads. A suspect (30) was bust on Friday, 18 June and appeared in the Krugersdorp Magistrates Court on Monday, 21 June on murder charges. Lucky’s family believed he fought from the grave to guide the residents who tipped the police. His niece Ntombi Mmola said his body looked horrible when it was removed from the grave. “It looked like he’d been crushed with rocks before he was dumped in a shallow grave,” she said. “The person who did it maybe thought he wasn’t going to be found. “We’re grateful Lucky fought from the grave to bring the suspect to book.” She said the family wants justice. “Lucky was a good person. It would break us if his killer got away,” she said. Sergeant Kgomotso Mogwere said Lucky’s body was found buried in a shallow grave at Protea Mine in Magaliesburg. “Through a post mortem, the recovered body was linked to a missing persons case which was reported at Magaliesburg cop shop in April,” said the sergeant. Acting station commander Captain Irene Tshikovhi applauded the team of detectives and community members for working together on tracing the missing person and arresting the suspect. “Violent crimes such as murder have a long-lasting emotional impact on the affected family,” she said. “We’ll therefore continue to extend the long arm of the law and bring the perpetrators to book.”
