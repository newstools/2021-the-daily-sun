RHULANI Mokwena has been keeping tv viewers warm with his top-notch punditry this winter. The philosophical Mamelodi Sundowns coach is part of SuperSport’s "expert line-up" for the channel’s coverage of the current Euro 2020 finals. The Nigerian presenter doesn't know we also have the master, Steve Komphela.Rhulani just marinated him???? pic.twitter.com/cMEQ7sbSfM  But it hasn’t taken fans and even tv presenters long enough to warm up to him, thanks to the edifying football analysis. The erudite had Charles Anazodo eating out of his palm with his sleek lines that would have even left one Steve Komphela smiling from ear to ear. “Sometime football gives life lessons. I often say the game is a microscopic reflection of society,” said Mokwena, much to the delight of Anazodo. Mokwena is not the only coach in the studio. There is also Marumo Gallants coach Dylan Kerr, ex-Kaizer Chiefs mentor Gavin Hunt and TS Galaxy assistant coach Shaun Bartlett.
