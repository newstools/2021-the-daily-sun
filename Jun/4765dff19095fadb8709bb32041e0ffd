A WOMAN allegedly cut off her husband’s 4-5 and cooked it! The woman from Brazil was arrested after she allegedly killed her husband before chopping off his penis and frying it. According to UK-based publication The Sun, the woman told the cops that she was acting in self-defence after her husband attacked her. The news outlet reported that the neighbours called cops and the 33-year-old woman was arrested on Monday, 7 June in São Gonçalo following the gruesome discovery of her partner’s body. “According to officers, she cut off the penis and cooked it in soybean oil in a frying pan, having allegedly murdered him at around 4am. They seized a kitchen knife from the scene, believed to have been the one she used to kill her husband with and subsequently dismembered him,” the article read. Media reports suggested that the woman had since been charged with murder and corpse desecration. The victim’s sister Adriana Santos told local news publications that the suspect killed her brother in revenge for him cheating on her. However, the suspect’s lawyer refuted the claims. “He did not accept the end of the relationship and said if she could not be with him, she could not be with anyone else,” the lawyer said.
