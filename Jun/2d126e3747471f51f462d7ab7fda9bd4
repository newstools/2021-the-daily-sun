We need to guard our borders carefully. Our borders are porous and we run the risk of being outnumbered by unregistered foreigners. Our laws have many loopholes, and this makes the justice system ineffective. People come and go without proper papers. Countries around the world have measures in place to control foreigners entering into their territories. South Africa lacks that. Not all people coming into South Africa are criminals, but we have become a haven for criminals who commit crimes, only to run back home by crossing the border. There are no controls and thatâ€™s part of the crime problem in South Africa. Whoever enters the country must be properly documented.
