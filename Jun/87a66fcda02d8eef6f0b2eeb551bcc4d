TO mark World No Tobacco Day on Monday, 31 May, the World Health Organisation released a report on smokers. The report stated that smokers were at risk of dying from Covid-19. In line with this year’s World No Tobacco Day theme “Commit to Quit”, tobacco control advocates are part of a campaign themed Yes We Quit. The campaign aims to encourage the end of tobacco use across the continent. Leonce Sessou, executive director of African Tobacco Control Alliance, said: “The World No Tobacco Day theme is an opportunity to highlight the importance of tobacco cessation, and that’s why we’re all part of it.” But smokers told Daily Sun quitting was not an option. Sibusiso Nhlapho (29) said he’s been smoking for 10 years and didn’t have any intention to stop. “I tried stopping years ago but couldn’t manage. I don’t think I will ever stop unless I get really sick and I’m forced to stop smoking,” he said. Sipho Ntuli (45) said he couldn’t stop. “Covid-19 has never been an excuse for smokers to stop. I continued to smoke even when we bought cigarettes at a high price,” he said. Helping people quit tobacco use has been identified as one of the six most cost-effective and impactful measures that can help countries reduce the demand for tobacco. These measures, known as MPOWER, also include monitoring tobacco use and prevention policies, protecting people from tobacco smoke, warnings about the dangers of tobacco, enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship and raising taxes on tobacco,” said Dr Jim Arinaitwe, centre manager for Centre for Tobacco Control in Africa. “Unfortunately, despite being one of the most important MPOWER measures, offering help to quit tobacco has been identified as the most under-utilised of these measures.”
