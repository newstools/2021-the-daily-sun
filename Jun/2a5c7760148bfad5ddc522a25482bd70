Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane says Kaizer Chiefs are tough to analyse ahead of their CAF Champions League final clash. Chiefs advanced to the showpiece match with a 1-0 aggregate victory over Wydad Casablanca thanks to Samir Nurkovic's first-leg goal. Al Ahly progressed with a 4-0 aggregate win over Esperance Sportive de Tunis. Mosimane knows a thing or two about Chiefs, having played them dozens of times during his tenure at Mamelodi Sundowns.And he has labelled Chiefs as a 'mysterious' side because of the fact they have made it all away to the biggest club game in Africa, despite finishing eighth on the standings. "Kaizer Chiefs are a mysterious team, despite occupying a low place in the South African league, they qualified to the CAF Champions League final," said 'Jingles'."It is difficult to study them because they score a lot of goals and concede a lot of goals."The CAF Champions League final will be staged at the Mohamed V Stadium in Morocco on Saturday, 17 July. -TeamTalkMedia
