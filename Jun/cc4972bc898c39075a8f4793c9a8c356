Kaizer Chiefs are positive about holding off the threat of Morocco’s Wydad Casablanca when they host them in their Caf Champions League semifinal second leg at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. “We have no fear. We are positive about getting a positive result. We really don’t have any doubt that we’ll definitely go through to the final,” caretaker co-coach Arthur Zwane told a news conference on Friday. “We know it is not going to be an easy one, but we are confident of a positive result.” “We managed to execute a plan in Morocco, and now we are back home with that one-goal cushion. We hope now not to concede and, at the same time, get another goal. We are going to be trying to kill off the game as quickly as we can tomorrow. “Wydad are the team who are chasing now, and will definitely want to score and they’ll be the team who will then be open at the back. That is what happened in Morocco also in the first leg. We didn’t have many chances but we took one of the few that we had. Now that we are playing at home we’ll hope for more chances and look to convert one or two and then make sure we don’t concede, which is the most important thing,” Zwane added. He confirmed new coach Stuart Baxter, who is still waiting for a work permit, had been involved in preparations throughout the week. SuperSport
