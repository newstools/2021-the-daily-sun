The United
Arab Emirates ratified an extradition treaty with South Africa, which is
seeking the extradition of three brothers accused of corruption. The treaty
was signed on April 11, the U.A.E. Embassy said in a statement on Wednesday.
Clayson Monyela, a spokesman for the South African Department of International
Relations and Cooperation, confirmed the statement. South
Africa’s government asked the U.A.E. in 2018 to extradite members of the Gupta
family, who’ve been accused by the authorities of using their links with former
President Jacob Zuma to secure deals to loot state-owned companies. President
Cyril Ramaphosa has estimated that more than 500 billion rand ($37 billion) was
stolen from the state during Zuma’s rule. The Guptas,
some of whom reside in the emirate of Dubai, deny any wrongdoing. Last week,
South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority said it will ask Interpol to
assist with the execution of arrest warrants for Atul and Rajesh Gupta and
their spouses, along with four other people. The U.S.
Treasury in October 2019 imposed sanctions on brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh
Gupta and a fourth businessman, who it said were members of a “significant
corruption network” in South Africa. The U.K. government announced in April it
also plans to impose travel restrictions and asset freezes on the three
brothers. Sindisiwe
Seboka, a spokeswoman for the National Prosecuting Authority, didn’t answer
calls seeking comment. the UAE’s Foreign Ministry said by email it would
respond later to a request for comment.
