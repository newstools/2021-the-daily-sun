NIZAAM Carr will be leaving the Bulls at the end of the season to return to English club Wasps. The Tshwane franchise announced on Monday that the loose forward will join up with his Wasps teammates after winter. “Dear Nemo … Thanks for putting in the hard yards,” the Bulls said on Monday. “Thanks for the big hits and intense work rate … thanks for being an amazing part of our leadership group and thanks for the laughs and tears we shared … but most importantly, thanks for being #TrueToTheBlue.” Carr won the Super Rugby Unlocked and Currie Cup last season and also played an influential role for the Bulls in their Rainbow Cup SA final this season.
