Laughter by definition is the action or sound of laughing. Often triggered by something funny and humorous, many experts agree laughter is the medicine for everything. If we are to move with that notion, then the experts might be onto to something because according to research, people who laugh a lot tend to live longer. According to a large study published in the April 2016 issue of Psychosomatic Medicine, women with a strong sense of humour were found to live longer in spite of illness, especially cardiovascular disease and infection. While their male counterparts seem to be protected against infection. WHAT TYPE OF BREASTS DO MEN LIKE? Norwegian researchers reported findings from a 15-year study on the link between sense of humour and mortality among 53 556 women and men in their country. The team assessed the cognitive, social and affective components of humour using a validated questionnaire. They also examined death from specific conditions: heart disease, infection, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Their findings show that for women, high scores on humours cognitive component were associated with 48% less risk of death from all causes, a 73% lower risk of death from heart disease and an 83% lower risk of death from infection. For men, a link was found only for the risk of death from infection. Those with high humour scores had a 74% reduced risk. Simply put, a laughter a day keeps you alive in every way.
