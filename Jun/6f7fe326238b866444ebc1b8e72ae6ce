Radio presenter Thabo Mokwele, also known as Tbose, has taken back Sundays with soulful music. The Kaya 959 presenter, formerly Kaya FM, has returned to hosting Touch of Soul on Sundays between 2pm and 6pm and says he’s taking Sundays back. The show came back to Kaya at the beginning of May after being cancelled for a few months. Speaking to SunBuzz, Tbose said he loves the show because he gets to give people what they want. “I won’t lie. I like giving people what they want. And that’s one of the things I like about being on radio. We’re able to give people what they want but also be creative in how we package that content,” he said. “And since this show is about taking Sundays back, we’ll be doing it in a way that will ensure a huge market of people enjoy the show.” Tbose said part of taking Sundays back includes playing a variety of music.

I’m not saying that’s wrong, but it must be given a different and nice twist every week. “Yes, we can play the same artists but not the same songs. That’s where most shows lose it, but this show strives for a variety of music.” He promised the show won’t just play old music, but new and soulful music by young musicians as well. “There are so many talented musicians right now and a great example is Langa Mavuso. I get goosebumps just listening to him. You can’t deny such people space on radio. They’re so powerful,” he said. The radio presenter is still hosting the The Best T in the City from Monday to Thursday between 9am to 12pm and Platinum Fridays on Friday, at the same time, while hosting Touch of Soul.
