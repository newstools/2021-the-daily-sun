Is that a plane, is that a bird, is that a swallow? NO, it's a skydiver! And for his fault, the frustrated diver got himself a yellow card after landing in the middle of Polish fifth division soccer match, with the game underway. Players got a shock of their lives when a skydiver came flying down at 60km/h and they dispersed the pitch making way for his smooth landing. This isn’t the kind of dive you’ll usually see on a soccer field, hence it caught world attention. Much as the game was interrupted by the skydiver landing in the midfield circle right in the middle of play, no one was hurt. "Everyone on the ground handled the bizarre situation pretty calmly. The players scurried out of the way of the airborne pitch invader, the announcer let out a hearty chuckle and the referee responded by showing the parachutist a yellow card," reported SI.com. ??
