GOGOS from Marite near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, were excited to finally get the Covid-19 jab. The gogos were taken care of by Ward 6 Councillor Khanyisile Dube, who ensured they got breakfast while waiting for the vaccine on Wednesday, 2 June. Gogo Alitah Mthombeni (90), who is a striker for the gogos soccer team in the village, was seen doing the vosho outside the community hall after she got the jab. “I’m very happy today. I came in early and did not feel any pain. There were rumours we would die if we got vaccinated and that government officials will eat our pension money. But it’s not true,” said gogo Alitah. Mkhulu Paulos Mokoena (82) and his neighbour Bokseni Nyundu (78) were also happy they got the jab. Mpumalanga Health MEC Sasekani Manzini said they were encouraged by the number of residents who came to get the vaccine. “Elderly people were so excited to get the vaccine. This shows they want to work with our government as far as curbing the spread of Covid-19. “We want to encourage our people to make sure they observe protocols. The president indicated we are moving toward a third wave, meaning a lot of people will be infected with Covid-19. So we want our people to be vaccinated as soon as possible.” She said they would meet the traditional leaders and other partners soon to discuss the support they are going to give the provincial government with the roll-out of the vaccine programme.
