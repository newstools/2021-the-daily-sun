KAIZER Chiefs are desperate for a strong finish to what has been a disappointing season. The Glamour Boys have been extremely underwhelming in domestic football this season, struggling to compete with the big boys. They have been fighting at the wrong end of the Premiership table for the better part of the season. At some point, the threat of relegation was real as they sat precariously in the bottom half of the table. This eventually led to the demise of coach Gavin Hunt, who was shown the door with only two matches remaining. His two assistants, Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard are now tasked with salvaging the campaign. And the pair got off to a bright start, leading Chiefs to a 3-2 win over Golden Arrows last time out. This saw their slim hopes of finishing in the top eight revived and they now look to get across the line on the final day. They play their direct rivals for a top-eight spot in TS Galaxy at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday (3pm). The two sides are separated by only three points and have the same goal difference heading into their decider. Zwane insists that his side will go out all guns blazing and will take the game to Galaxy, who only need a point to hang on to their spot. “We want to be in the top eight,” said Zwane. “They are currently in the top eight and if they lose the game then we kick them out of the top eight and take their position. “We come into this game very cautious. We know they will want to secure a point but hoping to steal all three if possible. “The team that will go all out is us because we want to be in the top-eight at all cost. We will take the game to them and that means we will be a bit vulnerable at the back but we have prepared for those situations. “We are going out guns blazing, we need maximum points because one will not help us in this situation.”
