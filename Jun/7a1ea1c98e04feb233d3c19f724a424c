THULANI Ngcuzana treats his 10 dogs like his children. The 39-year-old from Rooi Dark in Grabouw, Western Cape, told Daily Sun people need to treat dogs well because they also have feelings. “I get hurt when I see people not feeding dogs or giving them leftovers. They need to have a proper meal,” he said. Among his dogs are ones called Sangoma, Bathakathi, Mzion, Chillis and Fufu. “I love my dogs so much, and that’s why I’ve hired two people to cook for them every day,” he said. He said he pays the cooks R150 each so his dogs are properly fed. He took the dogs to the Eastern Cape with him in December. “I’d never leave my dogs here. They need to know where I come from,” he said. “I wouldn’t leave them here when I go home with my kids because they’re also my kids.” Thulani said he spends more than R1 000 a month on food for his dogs. “In my budget, I also include my dogs because I can’t expect them to take care of me while I don’t treat them right. We need to love them,” he said. “I built a warm shack for them because I can’t make them stay outside just because they’re dogs. “They have feelings and need love, just like kids.” Thulani, a businessman, has a son and a daughter who also love dogs! His wife Nolitha Magqazana said it was Thulani who taught her how to take care of dogs. “We treat these dogs like humans, and the love we give our kids is the same as the love we give these dogs,” said Nolitha. Resident Lindani Rhubuse (34) said he didn’t like dogs very much until he saw how Thulani treated his.
