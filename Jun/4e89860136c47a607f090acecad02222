A couple was recently caught by a webcam having sex on a mountain in Austria. According to Daily Mail, the cameras at the Nock Mountain National Park in Austria captured a pair of mountaineers having a naughty moment while taking a break from hiking. “The unknown lovebirds disappeared from the camera’s sight 20 minutes later at 12.40pm, but went viral when the images appeared online. In Austria, any recordings of public places are tightly regulated and, in most cases, prohibited with severe fines for any breaches,” the article read. It is not clear when the incident happened. Ronald Schellander, from the WMS company called Web Media Solutions, told the publication that weather cameras were not considered surveillance cameras and said he was concerned about how the intimate images were made public. “Basically, we position cameras in such a way that no people can be recognised due to the resolution of the camera or the distance,” he said.
