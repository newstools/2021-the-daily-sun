THE dog was vicious and dangerous. Residents said it would open the gate by itself and chase kids in the street. The dog ended up biting Ayanda Magubane (5), who had to be treated in hospital. The community of Crystal Park in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, can breathe easily as the dog was now been removed. It was removed by the SPCA, the South African Animal Rescue and Prosecution Division and the municipal environmental health department on Wednesday, 9 June. This came after Daily Sun intervened. Jerry Selloane of the division said: “We could see the dog opening the gate to get out. “Our duty is to ensure the dog doesn’t harm people, and in return that it doesn’t get harmed as people will retaliate.” He said although the owner didn’t want to give the dog up, it was taken to the Benoni SPCA. Ayanda’s mum, Lindi, (21) said she was happy the dog was removed. “I’m relieved that kids will be able to play freely, but the scars my son has will forever remind him of the incident,” she said. Lindi said when she first opened a case with police, they dragged their feet and the dog continued chasing children. Ayanda was recovering at home and would be getting counselling.
