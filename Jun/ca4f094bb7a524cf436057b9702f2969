A LOT of families have found themselves fighting for ownership of houses that don’t belong to them. Some have been illegally evicted by relatives who want to make a quick buck from selling the house. Joburg MMC for Housing Mlungisi Mabaso told Daily Sun the importance of having a title deed and a will. Mabaso said that a title deed proved and guaranteed the ownership of the house. He said one sad aspect is that when you’re a mother living with your kids, family members see the opportunity to sell your house when you die. “They don’t mind leaving your kids in the streets for the sake of money. “It’s unfortunate some people are able to forge documents and make sales without the owners knowing. That’s why it’s important to have a will that will stand in court,” he said. Mabaso said he will be handing over 2 900 title deeds in various parts of Gauteng next week. “It’s the responsibility of the rightful owner to identify a beneficiary should they die to avoid the criminality that has taken over many families,” he said. A woman from Emdeni, Soweto, said she was chased out of her home by her brother. “When my mother died, my brother, who has his own house, ordered me and my children to leave,’ she said. “He knew I had nowhere to go, but didn’t care. He wanted to sell the house and give me a small amount. “He even told me I know nothing about money and have no use for it. “I’ve been living in a shack with my children since.” She said she didn’t have the energy to fight for the house as there were already new owners. Ntombizodwa Zondo also from Emdeni said she has never been in the same situation, but has seen a lot of houses with “Not For Sale” signs. “How can you evict eight people living in a four-roomed house just so you can get money for yourself? I hope the government focuses on this,” she said.
