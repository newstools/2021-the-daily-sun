The Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) arrested a 55-year-old woman after she refused a speeding fine and drove off. She had been pulled over on JG Strydom Road on Thursday. According to EMPD spokesperson, Kobeli Mokheseng, officers stopped a blue Mercedes Benz hatchback, which had been driving at 77km/h, instead of the 60km/h limit. "As enforcers were issuing a R600 speeding fine to the 55-year-old female driver, the unruly male passenger, in his 20s, harshly intervened, instructing officers not to dispense the citation," Mokheseng said. "In a blink of an eye, the lady driver drove off at high speed, when officers were preparing to arrest the man for interference, leaving behind her driverâ€™s licence card and the almost done traffic fine." A few minutes later, the driver returned. She said she had to drop the passenger at the nearest medical centre because he was allegedly not feeling well. "The 55-year-old lady driver was immediately handcuffed, for defeating the ends of justice." In a separate incident on Friday, while monitoring the Swartkoppies Road, between Vermouten and Hennie Alberts, which is zoned for 70km/h, the EMPD officers stopped a silver Mercedes Benz ML SUV, which clocked 105km/h. "The 33-year-old male driver faces charges of reckless and negligent driving." Both drivers were detained at Brackendowns police station and they are expected to appear in the Palmridge Magistrate's Court soon.
