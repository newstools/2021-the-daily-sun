LEADERS of the June 16 1976 Soweto Uprising met over the weekend to share stories of how the historic day came about. They hosted a virtual event on Sunday, 13 June to talk about Youth Day. Seth Mazibuko, who was the youngest member of the Student Action Committee that planned and led the Soweto uprising, said several meetings between students were held prior to the uprising. He said on 13 June 1976, a meeting was held by the South African Student Movement in Welgespruit. He said he was invited after students from Naledi High School burnt down a police car when the cops tried to arrest one of the student leaders, Enos Ngutshana. “About four schools were already in boycott and demanded to meet then Minister of Bantu Education MC Botha,” he said. He said during the meeting, a resolution was taken that they would support Naledi high students. Mazibuko said on the eve of the uprising, a committee, which was made up of students from various schools, met to plan the day. “That meeting was purely a student meeting. There wasn’t any influence from any other parties. It was decided at that meeting that the issue was no longer about Afrikaans, but about Bantu education as a system,” said Mazibuko. Sibongile Mkhabela, who was secretary in the action committee, spoke about how she failed most of her subjects because of the abrupt and forced changed to Afrikaans. “When the Afrikaans issue was imposed, it was personal. Even my parents were not aware of what was happening at school until I brought home my report. I had failed every subject except Zulu, Afrikaans and English. I knew how to do Afrikaans as a language, but when you convert everything else it was a problem,” she said. Sibongile said even the teachers were dribbled by the language that they had to suddenly use to teach other subjects.
