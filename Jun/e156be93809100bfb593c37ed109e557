CHIPPA United midfielder, Maloisane Mokhele, says being nominated for the Nedbank Cup’s Most Promising Player award has motivated him to work hard. The 24-year-old player was nominated alongside Kaizer Chiefs defender Njabulo Blom and Khanyisa Mayo of GladAfrica Championship side Richards Bay. Maloisane was recognised for the key role he played in helping Chippa to reach the Ke Yona Cup final where they lost 1-0 to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) last month. Ironically, the teams also met yesterday in a crucial DStv Premiership relegation battle at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. Said Mokhele: “I’m happy to be nominated, but I was not surprised as I assisted the team to do well in the competition. It motivated me to work extra hard to get more rewards because if I relax I won’t get more nominations.” However, the stocky player said he’s disappointed that his side failed to win their maiden trophy. “I was disappointed that we failed to win the trophy. It’s my first season in the PSL and it was my wish to help the club make history, but unfortunately it was never meant to be as we lost to TTM. We will continue to give our best and hopefully one day we will make our fans proud by winning something.” Mokhele is aware that his side could get relegated if they fail to win their remaining games. The Chilli Boys will wrap up their league schedule on Saturday with a date against SuperSport United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.
