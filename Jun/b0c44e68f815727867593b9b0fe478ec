SENDING harmful messages on WhatsApp can now land you in jail. President Cyril Ramaphosa has signed into law the Cybercrimes Act, which criminalises sending harmful messages on social media. These included messages that incited damage to property or violence, threatened people with damage to property violence or contained unlawful intimate images. Any person who contravened the act will be liable on conviction to a fine or imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years, or to both a fine and such imprisonment. Under the law, intentional access to a computer or data storage medium will also be considered an offence, along with the unlawful capture of or prying with data. The Act specified that communication service providers must report such cases of cyber offences without delay within 72 hours of becoming aware of them. Should the providers fail to report the cases, it may lead to a fine of as much as R50 000. Any person who unlawfully and intentionally disclosed, through an electronic communication service, a data message of an intimate image of a person without their consent, will be guilty of the offence.
