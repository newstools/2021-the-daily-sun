THE country will be on hard lockdown for 21 days. This is the claim made by EFF leader Julius Malema in an interview with television news channel Newzroom Africa on Monday morning, 21 June. Malema was answering a question around the vaccination programme which he described as shambolic. Malema questioned why the government had not bought vaccines from China and Russia, which he said had not been scientifically challenged. He further claimed that as the country is battling with the deadly virus, President Cyril Ramaphosa had revealed to him the country will be on level 5 for 21 days. He said this was revealed to him during discussions on how the country was planning to tackle the virus. He also spoke about how the government was planning to roll out the vaccination programme. “The problem is that always there is shifting of goalposts,” said Malema.

He said he has asked for a meeting with Ramaphosa to share his party’s ideas on how to tackle the virus. He then accused Ramaphosa of putting profit ahead of the country, accusing him of colluding with the West and socially engaging them when he has banned political activities. “We have never called them irresponsible. I’m calling for a meeting once, once, and in less than two hours we’re done to raise the plight of our people. Let’s put aside business transactions and give our people the vaccines, which are available and can be provided in huge numbers,” he said.
