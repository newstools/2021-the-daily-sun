LERATO Kganyago’s husband, Thami Ndlala, and a friend have found themselves on the wrong side of the law. The two are accused of buying two luxury vehicles using fraudulent documents. The vehicles in question are a 2008 Range Rover TD V8 and a BMW 320i. According to police records seen by Daily Sun, Ndlala’s friend applied for motor vehicle finance for the Range Rover in 2012 and submitted payslips from the department of justice indicating he was a legal administration officer. After the financing was approved, he received the Range Rover and gave it to Ndlala. A few months later he applied for financing again. This time he claimed to be the department’s director. He received financing for the BMW, which he kept for himself. Police records say the bank statements and payslips he used in both applications were falsified. Both men have been charged with fraud and forgery. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu confirmed the matter was being investigated. “Two suspects positively linked to this case are expected to appear in court on 2 July. The first suspect, aged 32, was served with a summons in May,” she said. When Ndlala was called for comment yesterday, he said he was eating breakfast and would speak to the SunTeam at about midday. Several calls were made at the time he requested but he hung up and later calls went straight to voicemail.
