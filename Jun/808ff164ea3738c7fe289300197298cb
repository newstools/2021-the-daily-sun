IN a Bafana Bafana squad filled with new faces, goalkeeper Ronwen Williams is one of the more experienced players. The SuperSport shot stopper, who has 18 Bafana caps under his belt, will be expected to take on a leadership role. Williams will wear the captain’s armband when Bafana run out in an International friendly against Uganda at Orlando Stadium on Thursday (6pm). The 29-year-old will be assisted by Orlando Pirates’ Innocent Maela as vice-captain. Williams is looking forward to leading what has been described as the “new dawn” for Bafana, as the rebuild begins ahead of the World Cup qualifiers. “If you can see the team that’s been assembled, it’s a new team. There are a lot of new faces,” said Williams. “It is a new dawn in that sense. But Bafana have always been there. We are just continuing where the previous teams left off. “It’s for the new players to grab the opportunity with both hands. On a personal note, I’m just happy to be part of it.”
