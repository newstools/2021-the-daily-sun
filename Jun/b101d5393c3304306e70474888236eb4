THE rejection Kabelo Mahlasela suffered at Kaizer Chiefs has made him stronger, stresses the attacking midfielder who now ply his trade with Royal AM. Mahlasela was released by Amakhosi midway through last season, where he was initially loaned to Polokwane City. But he could not help the Limpopo club avoid relegation to the GladAfrica Championship. When he went back to Chiefs, the club informed him before this season started that he was not going to be part of their plans, leading to him joining Royal AM. “The rejection made me stronger,” said Mahlasela. “Giving up is not an option for me. I’ve never given up in my life, so I won’t start it now. I’ll keep on pushing until the very last.” Mahlasela’s positive attitude has paid off. Since joining Royal AM, he featured in 25 games this season, scoring four goals and helping the team finish on top of the Championship. However, AM were not presented with the Championship trophy last Sunday after the final round of games as there is an unresolved legal case involving Sekhukhune United and Mahlasela’s former club, Polokwane. “We know our mission and we regard ourselves as champions regardless of what is happening. I strongly believe that points are earned on the field and that’s what we did,” said Mahlasela. The 30-year-old joined Chiefs ahead of the 2018-19 season from Bloemfontein Celtic. But in one and half seasons with the Soweto giants, Mahlasela struggled to command a starting place, featuring in only 16 matches in all competitions with no goals.
