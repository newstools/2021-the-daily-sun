ACTRESS Zandile Msutwana, who plays Vuyiswa on Mzansi Magic’s telenovela The Queen, is back on set. This after being on leave since March. She had sustained an injury while on set and was booked off to recover at home. Shortly after the injury, the producers of the show had to find someone else and she was temporarily replaced by media personality Thembisa Mdoda-Nxumalo, who has been playing the role since April. “We have no doubt that with Thembisa’s immense talent and skills, along with the support and guidance she has received from Msutwana, the character of Vuyiswa Maake will continue to steal the hearts of the viewers. “We are very excited for Mdoda-Nxumalo and thankful to her for taking this gigantic challenge with so much grace. We wish Msutwana a speedy recovery and look forward to her return soonest,” Mzansi Magic said. ALSO READ | TOP DESIGNER SLAMS CITY OF JOBURG, METRO COPS!
