NEW TV channel Welkom TV gives opportunities to the youth in the Free State. The channel, founded by Ayabulela Mqina (29) and Moses Lephutha (21), will be on DStv channel 126 from 31 July. Ayabulela said the main focus of the station is to give the youth of Free State jobs. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said: “A big part of this project was to develop the province. “We saw that people here are talented but don’t have a platform to explore and showcase their talent. “They can only go to Joburg if they want to chase their dreams and sometimes even that doesn’t work out. “A lot of focus in the province is on mining and farming. There’s not much focus on media and we had to open up that opportunity.” Ayabulela said the channel already has 15 presenters. “We’ve already employed 12 presenters from Free State. We didn’t want to go with the already well-known people as presenters or news readers because our focus is on the youth from here. “But we have three surprise presenters from the SABC and Vuzu. They will be part of us to boost the channel and to show these young presenters the ropes.” ALSO READ | TV HOST: I CAN TAKE ON BIG ZULU The 24-hour-channel has everything from talk shows to educational shows and daily soapies. “We’ll have talk shows like Community Service and Let’s Talk Mzansi, which will focus on current affairs, government, our communities and service delivery. “We have music shows for all music genres, including amapiano and hip hop. We also have educational shows as well,” said Ayabulela. “We’ll have a soapie that’s written by Thembinkosi Thwala, who plays Mondli on Uzalo. It’s called Notorious Gang and will air Monday to Friday.” They are launching the channel on 31 July at the park opposite Welkom City Hall. “We’ll be going on air on the same day,” said Ayabulela.
