MURDERER Aubrey Manaka, who confessed to killing Capricorn TVET College student Precious Ramabulana (21), has been slapped with two life sentences in the Limpopo High Court. Judge Francis Kganyago sentenced Manaka (30) to eight years for housebreaking, life sentences for murder and rape as well as 15 years for robbery. Kganyago further ruled that all sentences run concurrently. He told Manaka, who had pleaded guilty to all charges, that he was a heartless and evil person with no soul. “You killed a young, vulnerable person whose family expected more from after finishing her studies,” Kganyago said before sentencing. The victim’s aunt Mavis Sitholimela said they welcomed the sentencing, but it could still not bring Ramabulana back. “We are still hurting as a family. And now that justice has been served, we will feel better. Her mother Peggy has been in hospital throughout the trial as she suffers from depression.” Ramabulana was a Public Management student in Botlokwa, Limpopo. She had rented a room in Ga-Joel section in Mokomene when Manaka attacked her on 24 November 2019.
