NOW that the PSL season has ended, veteran Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune enjoys spending time with his kids. The 33-year-old shot stopper posted a picture with his daughter and new born baby on Twitter appreciating every single moment he gets the opportunity to spend with them. Khune revealed that he is a proud father for the second time as he had another baby with his wife Sphelele Makhunga. The pair welcomed their first child last year. “Best feeling ever, God always has a better plan than we do. Proud dad for the second time.” A post shared by itukhune32???? (@itukhune32)
