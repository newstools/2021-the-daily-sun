AS sentencing proceedings in the murder case of Capricorn TVET College student Precious Ramabulana (21) are under way in the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane, it has emerged that she was stabbed 90 times and left for dead. That’s according to a post mortem read before the court by prosecutor Trot Mphahlele. The shocking revelation came after Aubrey Manaka (30) pleaded guilty on Wednesday, 9 June to killing and raping Ramabulana. In mitigation of sentence, Manaka said after he broke into Ramabulana’s room, he first stabbed her a couple of times and started raping her while bleeding. “After I finished having sex with her I stabbed her for the second time until she responded no more. When I stabbed her for the second time I was scared that she’d identify me to the police,” he told the court. Manaka asked for forgiveness from the Ramabulana family and the public for the pain he’d caused them. “I know that Precious would be something in life today and would have proceeded with her career. I’m asking for forgiveness,” he said. Ramabulana was a public management student at Capricorn TVET College Ramokgopa campus in Botlokwa. She was renting a room at an outcampus residence in Ga-Joel section when Manaka attacked her on 24 November 2019. Ramabulana’s death shocked Mzansi and President Cyril Ramaphosa visited her home in Ndzelele, outside Makhado.
