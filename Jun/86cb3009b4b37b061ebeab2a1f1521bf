A 39-year-old man was arrested on the N1 Highway on Wednesday after allegedly being found in possession of 800kg of compressed pure cocaine. The cocaine was hidden in a 12-foot ski boat, which was being towed by a bakkie. According to a statement by the Hawks, the bakkie was stopped on the N1, near the R21 Flying Saucer interchange, by a multi-disciplinary team, comprising the South African Narcotic Enforcement Bureau, Pretoria Serious Organised Crime, the Hawks and Crime Intelligence. Hawks spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale said the vehicle was stopped after authorities received information about the cargo. "Upon searching the boat, the team found 800kg of compressed pure cocaine, with an estimated street value of R400 million," Mogale said. "Investigations are continuing, and more arrests are imminent." ALSO READ: HANDS OFF MY KUKU 4-5! Hawks boss, Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya, lauded the team for the arrest.
