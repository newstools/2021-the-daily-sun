Seven people have been killed in Gugulethu NY 79 in Cape Town. The deceased were attending a traditional ceremony in the area. A resident who asked to remain anonymous said the killings have left them shocked and afraid. “This is not the first time that something like this happened in Gugulethu, police need to do their job to arrest bad guys because while they are still on the streets incidents like these will continue”, added the resident. Another resident said Gugulethu needs prayers. “We need pastors to come and pray for Gugulethu, this is not right”, added the resident. He said, as residents, they need to work with police officers. “There is no way that no one saw who shot these people, but people are afraid of coming forward with the information because they are afraid of being killed for something that was not their concern”, added the resident. Brigadier Novela Potelwa said Western Cape has instituted the 72 Activation Plan for the mobilization of resources in search of gunmen who shot and killed people in Gugulethu. She said five people were shot dead by yet to be identified suspects who later fled in a vehicle. “Two other individuals were wounded in the shooting incident, they were rushed to a medical facility for treatment where they later died”, said Potelwa. According to her reports, the victims were attending a traditional ceremony. Organized crime detectives are probing the seven murders and anyone with information that could assist the investigation is urged to contact the police on 08600 10111. “The identities and ages of the deceased persons will be released once their next of kin are informed”, she added. The motive for the shooting incident is yet to be determined. Western Cape Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Thembisile Patekile says police teams are already pursuing several leads. “The teams will work through the night conducting tracing operation”, added Patekile.
