IT was a cold Sunday evening, so the friends made a mbawula outside their shack. But they never thought they’d be robbed, so they were surprised when five armed men surrounded them and demanded cash and cellphones. The thugs then searched them and took money and cellphones. But they were not happy with the cash they got from the friends. They demanded more, but the victims told them that was the only money they had. However, the thugs were not convinced and ransacked the shack, where they found R60 000 hidden among the blankets. The heartbroken victim said he had been saving money with the hope of buying a bakkie. “I’ve been selling recycling goods to save up. I planned to buy a van to make my life easy. “I’ve been saving this money for more than a year. I don’t know what to do,” he said. The man said he saved the money in his shack as he didn’t have an ID and couldn’t open a bank account. “I will keep hustling. I wish the people who stole from me are arrested.” Captain Johannes Ramphora of Springs Police Station said no arrests have been made yet, and no shots were fired during the robbery.
