JUST like money makes the world go round, so does having sex. While a lot has been said about the benefits of having regular sex, we often forget that having sex should be fun and must be treated as a special event. Speaking of events, there are global sex promoters who have heeded the call and have made sex an actual event. According to event magazine Scoop-Whoop, there are 10 big sex festivals in the world. Let’s take a look at the top five sex festivals and events in the world: 1. Kinky Copenhagen (Denmark) A festival with a focus on kink, you’ll find all manner of non-conformity here. There’s more latex than you can handle, and whips cracking in every corner. 2. Sexpo (South Africa and Australia) This blast of a fest features performers from all aspects of adult entertainment, including burlesque, male and female exotic dancing and pornography. It also involves a focus on broadening the world’s sexual horizons. 3. Kutemajrvi Sex Festival (Finland) Taking place in a beautiful little village, this festival features lectures on sex, a sex toy expo, strip shows, exotic dancers and the Aphrodite competition, a nude beauty pageant. 4. Love Parade (Berlin, Germany) Technically, this is the largest techno festival in the world. But for all intents and purposes, it’s a sex festival. 5. Erotica (London) Arguably the biggest sex festival in the whole world, this trade show has areas like an erotic jewellery boutique. 50 to 100 000 people show up every year, including celebrities.
