BESIDES being the epicentre of pleasure and excitement, the punani is one fascinating organ in the female body. While many gynaecologists may agree on its complexities, many people may not be aware that it has multiple functions and is not only limited to sex and giving birth. According to healthshots.com, the punani has a wide range of functions and things we might have not been aware of, and listed these as the top five: 1. The punani is bigger than you think The clitoris is much bigger than the little button you can see as only a quarter is outside the body and visible to the naked eye. The rest of it is placed inside your body. The clitoris is actually shaped like a wishbone that extends into the body and around the vaginal canal, but isn’t part of the punani. 2. It has many nerve endings The gland or invisible part of the clitoris has over 8 000 sensory nerve endings. This makes this tiny area the most sensitive part of a woman’s body. 3. The punani’s sole purpose is pleasure The clitoris is the only organ in the female body with the sole purpose of providing sexual pleasure when stimulated. The 8 000 nerve endings are responsible for making it a powerhouse of pleasure, and it doesn’t play a direct role in reproduction. 4. It grows throughout your life The clitoris actually grows during a woman’s lifetime. It doesn’t stretch out too much, but rather extends to an astonishing 10cm. The growth occurs as a result of hormonal changes in the body. 5. The punani is very similar to the 4-5 The clitoris has glans (foreskin), erectile tissue and a very small shaft – all of which are found on a 4-5. This is why the functions of a clitoris are similar to those of a penis. In fact, it even swells up when aroused.
