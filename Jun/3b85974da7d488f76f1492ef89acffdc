THE community of Mathibestad near Hammanskraal, Tshwane, want Monni Monyeki’s alleged killer not to be granted bail and be sentenced to no less than 300 years in jail if found guilty. They spoke on Thursday, 17 June when murder accused Samuel Noko appeared in the Moretele Magistrates Court for murder and defeating the ends of justice. Residents said he should not be granted bail and should be sent straight to jail. Noko (34) allegedly murdered Monyeki (28) from Lefatlheng Section after she went missing on 29 May. Her body was found buried in a shallow grave after he led cops to it. He also faces rape charges after he allegedly raped a 15-year-old who was accompanying Monyeki when she went to perform traditional rituals on the day she went missing. Community leader, Steven Tlhwaele, told Daily Sun if harsh sentences were considered, this would send a clear message to those thinking of raping, killing, burning and burying women and children to think twice.
