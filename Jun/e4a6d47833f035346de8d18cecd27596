Veteran Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune says having a smile is a good therapy. Khune posted his picture on Twitter with a broad smile informing his followers that a smile is a good therapy. The 33-year-old shot stopper has had tough times in his life as he lost his sister while his career also took a nose dive last season. Despite the setback, Khune managed to keep his head up and recently had a new born baby, his second child which also brought him the much needed smile, but mostly importantly the therapy  to regain his place in Chiefs ‘ starting line-up where Nigerian Daniel Akpeyi and Bruce Bvuma are regular. Smile, it's free therapy ?????? pic.twitter.com/mCGjUBLWxX
