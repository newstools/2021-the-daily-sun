It’s a pity that we are celebrating Youth Month with directionless custodians of this country’s future. They are more into parties, drugs and all sorts of bad things. While taking the journey into adulthood, our youth find themselves faced with a constant barrage of conflicting images that are contrary to God’s Word. Peer pressure, loneliness, sex movies, sultry music videos, pornographic magazines, and even the internet offer little refuge from an all-out attack on their sex purity. Challenged by day and often tormented by night, young people turn to church that, at times, has been blamed with failing to keep it real. It’s really a crossroads for our youth. Samuel Radebe Heilbron
