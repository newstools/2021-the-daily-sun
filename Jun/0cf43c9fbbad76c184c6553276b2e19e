THE Proteas thumped West Indies by 158-run to
clinch a 2-0 series win in St Lucia and secure their first win away from home
in four years. The win was comprehensive, achieved with more
than a day and a session to spare in the second five-day match which came to
its conclusion at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground on Monday, following their
victory by an innings and 63 runs in the first match at the same venue. It was a perfect start for new skipper Dean Edgar
and a fantastic outing for spinner Keshav Maharaj, who picked a hat-trick. South Africa went into the fourth day needing
to pick up 10 wickets.
