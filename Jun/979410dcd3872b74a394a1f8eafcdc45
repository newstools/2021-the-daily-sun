ACTRESS Thembisa Mdoda Nxumalo has set tongues wagging. The presenter of Old Mutual’s singing competition Amazing Voices was recently seen showing a baby bump, which led to viewers speculating whether she was pregnant or not. After people started asking questions, the media personality took to social media to answer them. She wrote: “Don’t ask the question. The answer is yes.” She later posted another picture, teasing her fans that they would find out on the next episode whether she was pregnant or just bloated.

Thembisa, who temporarily replaced Zandile Msutwana on The Queen while she was on leave due to an injury, then made the shocking announcement that she had given birth. “A few months post-partum. Trying to get back into the rhythm of working out regularly. Face still has scarring from acne and the worst reaction to bad make-up. Year 38 and living,” she wrote. But she later debunked the rumours. Responding to the fashion designer who made the dress she wore on the show, Thembisa said she had just gained weight. “Elikem Kumordzie, see, I told you I gained too much weight. Now people think I’m pregnant,” she wrote. Daily Sun reached out to Thembisa, but her phone went to voicemail. A post shared by Thembisa Liyema Nxumalo (@thembisamdoda)
