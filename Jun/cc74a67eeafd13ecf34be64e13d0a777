THERE’S an English saying that says: ‘Don’t count your chickens before they hatch’. Loosely translated, the adage means you should not make plans that depend on something good happening before you know that it has actually happened. And it certainly rings true for GladAfrica Championship side Royal AM. The club, owned by Durban tycoon Shawn Mkhize, celebrated wining automatic promotion to the PSL last month. But those celebrations were premature as they now find themselves contesting in the promotion play-offs. This was after Polokwane City’s application to the Johannesburg high court to have an arbitrator award  overturned was dismissed on Saturday. This turn of events means that Sekhukhune, who were in their first season in the NFD, end higher than Royal AM on the final log standings. And Royal AM will have to go and fight for a place in the PSL via the promotion and relegation play-offs with Richards Bay and Chippa United. On the last day of the season, Royal AM celebrated promotion with their own trophy and medals. They had their own trophy and medals. Later in the evening they had a party, celebrating at the swanky Max's Lifestyle in Umlazi.
