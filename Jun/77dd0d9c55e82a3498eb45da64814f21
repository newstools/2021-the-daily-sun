KAIZER Chiefs supremo, Kaizer Motaung, has let the cat out of the bag that Molefi Ntseki has always been their target, even before he was poached by Safa as Bafana Bafana coach. Motaung revealed that they had spoken to the 51-year-old mentor in August 2019. “I must mention that we had engaged him before he joined Bafana. He was supposed to be here before his Bafana appointment,” Motaung revealed about their new Head of Technical and Youth Development Academy. “And obviously the process was interrupted by that. But when he was appointed by Bafana it was also a right step in his career. “I can only say that we are happy to have him here. I am confident that he will be able to carry the challenges on his shoulders.” Motaung made it clear that Ntseki will not be an assistant coach, saying: “He has bigger responsibilities.” Chiefs recently parted ways with coach Gavin Hunt and his then assistants – Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard – are momentarily in charge. Motaung further took a swipe at their past coaches whom he admitted they cost the club something critical over the years. The Amakhosi chairman said that is due to the club bringing in new coaches from time to time and allowing them to do things differently from the Chiefs way. Motaung added: “I am very happy that we have brought him here. The reason we appointed him is because of his extensive experience. “He has gone from school soccer to the national level. Because of his knowledge and experience, we felt there was a need to bring in someone of his stature to be able to preserve our culture and philosophy of football. “Hopefully with his appointment, he will be that custodian to make sure we embrace our culture.”
