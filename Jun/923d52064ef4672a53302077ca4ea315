STEMER Boshielo says his 4-5 is always asleep. The 38-year-old from Pienaarspoort in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, said his 4-5 hasn’t been working since 2015, a year after he started having kidney problems. He said he had to urinate through a catheter pipe for three weeks in 2014 while he was being treated at Steve Biko Academic Hospital. “Doctors told me I wasn’t suffering from any diseases and must drink lots of water,” said Stemer. He was admitted to KwaMhlanga Hospital in 2016 again as he was struggling to urinate. He said he peed in his pants from 2016 to 2019 and it led to him having to quit his job. In 2019, he claimed, he was admitted to Steve Biko Hospital again as a piece of plastic from the catheter allegedly had to be removed from his kidneys. “It damaged my 4-5. My 4-5 is asleep, even if I have a woman.” He alleged that doctors forgot the piece of plastic in his body. He said the right side of his body isn’t working properly. “Since January 2020, it’s felt like there’s a ball in my tummy,” he said. Stemer said he wanted the health department to compensate him. He said he was applying for a disability grant because he couldn’t work. His sister, Sannah Mogashwa, (34) said: “My brother is struggling to provide for himself and his family. He needs help.” Steve Biko CEO Mathabo Mathebula advised Stemer to go back to the hospital so he could be treated.
