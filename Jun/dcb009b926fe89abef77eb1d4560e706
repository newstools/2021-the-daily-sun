MZANSI is a country full of possibilities and more often
than not, serious situations are turned into something that can put smiles on
the faces of many. President Cyril Ramaphosa's 'Missing iPad' clip has been
turned into several songs, including an Amapiano song. It has been given a bit that could get people to dance until
their legs break. However, that can only be when the lockdown restrictions are
eased as there is now a third-wave scare. Some people on the social media streets are hoping that
popular Amapiano DJs such as Kabza De Small and Maphorisa can jump onto the
bandwagon and use that President's clip to make hits. I knew it that South Africa will make a song from that "iPad saga" ???? pic.twitter.com/95aPIKwrzC #cassper#Checkpoint IPad song is about to be released ??????South Africans don't waste time ?? pic.twitter.com/3IkONwaFyp Someone on TikTok asked for this.Cyril Ramaphosa IPad Remix | RETWEET ??????Full song: https://t.co/GXjmJkqKHo pic.twitter.com/gUJUxsDfzA
