SUPERSPORT United striker Bradley Grobler has finally clinched his maiden Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot award, but he is not satisfied. The 32-year-old ended his long wait for the DStv Premiership Golden Boot – finishing the campaign with 16 goals – the most by any player in Mzansi’s top flight. His final tally was one more than that of Mamelodi Sundowns striker Peter Shalulile, who finished on 15 goals. The Downs marksman was subsequently voted both the PSL Footballer of the Season and Player’s Player of the Season at the 2020-21 PSL Awards. Grobler, on the other hand, managed to deny Shalulile the top scorer’s award, which the Namibian shared with Orlando Pirates’ Gabadinho Mhango the season before. The Matsatsantsa a Pitori striker narrowly missed out on the award that season, ending on 14 goals, two behind Shalulile and Mhango. This season, however, Grobler finally got over the line much to his delight. “I’m feeling relieved. It’s been my dream for as long as I can remember to win the Golden Boot,” said Grobler. “It’s every striker’s dream. I have been close on a few occasions but didn’t quite get over the line. I have done it finally and it’s a great feeling.” Grobler is not entirely satisfied by his tally, having failed to reach his target of 20 goals that he set himself at the beginning of the season. He is hoping to become only the fifth player in the history of the Golden Boot to win the accolade with 20 or more goals. Wilfred Mugeyi, Pollen Ndlanya, Collins Mbesuma and Siyabonga Nomvethe are the only players who’ve managed to achieve that feat so far. “I’m not being hard on myself but I’m not satisfied, because I didn’t reach my target of 20 goals this season,” Grobler said. “But I will use that as motivation for next season. “I have broken that duck and the pressure is off a little bit now. “I hope that next season I can push on and get to that 20 goals target.”
