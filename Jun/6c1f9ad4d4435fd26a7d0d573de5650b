Maskandi singer Maqatha, who became Twitter famous as the maskandi Uber driver, says his journey in music has been filled with ups and downs. The musician, whose real name is Ntokozo Dlamini, started music in 2011 but has only become successful recently. The Joburg Uber driver, who’s originally from Ladysmith in KZN, recently dropped his second album titled Awehluleki Baba in April and it has done well. Speaking to SunBuzz about his journey, he said: “I started singing in 2011 and I was part of a group, but that didn’t work out. Then, I started singing solo in 2013, but that wasn’t successful as well. So I joined another group called Abahluleki in 2014. Again, I left the group and focused on myself. “In 2016, I recorded my first album titled Sobancane and it was released in 2017. It didn’t do well though.” ALSO READ | ZODWA WABANTU WANTS A BIGGER 4-5! Since releasing Awehluleki Baba, Maqatha said he doesn’t believe the response and love he has received from people. “People love it so much, I had a lot of CDs and they sold out. And all this is happening without any sort of marketing. “I hadn’t gone to any media to promote the album, but people bought all the copies I had. I have no words to express my joy and I am sure more people will enjoy it once I get airplay on TV and radio,” Maqatha said. The album is available on all digital platforms. Maqatha trended on Twitter last year after a video of him playing his song in his Uber car went viral.
