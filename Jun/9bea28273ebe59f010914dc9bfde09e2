MASKANDI artist Khaye “Mshiyazeqana” Mkhize has chosen to title his new album DSD Awusize. DSD is a fellow maskandi artist, whose real name is Khangelani Mhlongo. According to Mshiyazeqana, who hails from Maphumulo in northern KZN, DSD is one of a few maskandi artists who doesn’t insult artists on his songs to gain popularity. “Maskandi is now popular for having artists who swear at each other in their songs in order to attract followers. That indirectly kills the music because people end up thinking the artists who does that are maskandi gods and they’re not,” he said. The title of his album means DSD intervene. “I chose the title because I see DSD as a good example to maskandi artists. “He doesn’t insult fellow artists in his songs. For that I find his music authentic,” said Mshiyazeqana.
