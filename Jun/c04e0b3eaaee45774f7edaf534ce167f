KAIZER Chiefs have landed safely in Casablanca for their Caf Champions League mission. Amakhosi arrived two days before their epic Champions League semi-final battle with Wydad Athletic, scheduled to take place at the Mohammed V Stadium on Saturday (9pm). The club have posted images of the travelling contingent, including 21 players, for their biggest Champions League match ever.  In the squad, interim coaches Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard, have included the likes of Daniel Cardoso, Lebogang Manyama, Eric Mathoho, Philani Zulu, Bernard Parker, Itumeleng Khune, Njabulo Blom and Willard Katsande. Chiefs become just the third South African club to reach the semi-finals of the CAF Champions League, along with Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, and the opportunity now presents itself for the Amakhosi to carve out a place in history and go in search of a coveted African star of their own. Chiefs are also only the second South African team, along with cross-town rivals Orlando Pirates, to reach the semi-final stage of two different African Club competitions.
