Zambia’s former President Kenneth Kaunda is receiving
treatment for an undisclosed illness at a military hospital in the capital
Lusaka, his office has said, as the Southern African country battles a surge in
COVID-19 cases. The 97-year-old ruled Zambia from 1964, when the country won its
independence from Britain, until 1991. He is among the continent’s few
surviving liberation heroes. His administrative assistant Rodrick Ngolo said in a statement on
Monday that Kaunda had been feeling unwell and had been admitted to the Maina
Soko Medical Centre in Lusaka. “His Excellency Dr Kaunda is requesting all Zambians and the
international community to pray for him as the medical team is doing everything
to ensure he recovers,” the statement said. Though the short statement did not specify Kaunda’s illness,
Zambia is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases. Zambia’s seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen
dramatically over the past two weeks – from 1.44 new cases per 100,000 people
on May 30 to 8.91 new cases per 100,000 people on June 13. Meanwhile, President Edgar Lungu urged the nation to pray for the
former president so that “God may touch him with His healing hand”. “He stood up for this great nation at its most critical moment,
and so we can all stand up for him in his moment of weakness,” Lungu said on
his Facebook page. During his rule, Kaunda made Zambia a centre for anticolonial
groups fighting to end white minority rule in Southern African countries,
including Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Kaunda allowed the armed
organisations to maintain military bases, training camps, refugee centres and
administrative offices. Later in life, he regained stature as one of Africa’s political
giants, helping to mediate crises in Zimbabwe and Kenya. Affectionately known as &ldquo;KK&rdquo;, Kaunda was the head of the main nationalist
party, the left-of-centre United National Independence Party (UNIP).
