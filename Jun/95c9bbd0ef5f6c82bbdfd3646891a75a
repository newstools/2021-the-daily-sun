AL Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane said they are expected to reach the final of the Caf Champions League. The Red Devils thumped Esperance 3-0 on Saturday night to book their spot in the final with a 4-0 aggregate. They will now face Kaizer Chiefs, who are in the final for the first time in the club history. The final is scheduled to take place on July 17 in Casablanca, Morocco. “We feel good because we are in the final, but we have to be honest, we expected to be in the final,” said Mosimane. “Not only because we are a big team, but because we played to reach the final. We scored three goals against Mamelodi Sundowns, four against Esperance and five goals against Wydad last year. We are a big team.” The former Sundowns coach said the first-half red card received by Esperance defender Ilyes Chetti made things a bit easier for them on Saturday. Chetti was given his marching orders in the 36th minute after tripping Taher Mohamed in the penalty area. He stated: "We have to be honest, the red card helped us. It happened early, and it was well deserved. "We didn't start the game very well. We were a little bit nervous and anxious. However, football is not about how you start. But it is about how to finish. "Esperance is a big team, and we respect them a lot, but after conceding the first goal, the game was further complicated on them. Mosimane also said he was happy to reach the final of the continental competition for the season in a row."
