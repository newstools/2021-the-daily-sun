HUNDREDS of EFF members and their leaders marched to the offices of the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority in Tshwane on Friday, 25 June. The march started opposite the South African Police Service’s Maupa-Naga building in Sunnyside and proceeded to the authority’s headquarters. The EFF demanded Covid-19 vaccines from China and Russia be approved for use in Mzansi. Party leader Julius Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu led the march. Malema said: “We can’t listen to nonsense that says the Sputnik vaccine has certain things to meet before it’s approved.” The party condemned authority CEO Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela for coming to sign the memorandum while escorted by guards as police in full uniform were present. “We’re here peacefully to ask for the vaccine,” said Malema. “When we bring violence we can’t write a letter. “You will see us on your doorstep. This is pure thuggery and theft. “Our people are underground. No one is saying that’s a super-spreader. You’re irresponsible because it’s white monopoly capital that controls all these things.” EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu read the memorandum of demands. “Some of our demands as the EFF are the provision of scientifically tested and proven Covid-19 vaccines to all South Africans and the vaccination of all people,” he said. EFF spokesman Vuyani Pambo said: “We want vaccines from all over the world. We can’t watch as our loved ones die like flies.” Rapper Riky Rick, who attended the march, said he was supporting it because people needed vaccines. Fashion designer and EFF member Mosotho Mokoena burned impepho and asked the ancestors to tell Ramaphosa to give people vaccines.
