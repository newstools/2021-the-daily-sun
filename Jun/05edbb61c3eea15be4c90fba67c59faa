THE EFF says the local government elections, set for 27 October, will not be free or fair due to lockdown restrictions. The Red Berets said this in response to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement on Sunday, 30 May that the country would be moving up to alert level 2. In a statement, spokesman Vuyani Pambo said parties would not have an opportunity to freely campaign and interact with voters. “The EFF believes that any attempt to hold elections under these circumstances is an attempt by government to retain power through a manipulative use of the pandemic to suppress political opponents,” he wrote. The EFF has been calling for the elections to be postponed. The IEC has established a commission, led by former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke, to find out whether it’s possible to hold elections. However, DA leader John Steenhuisen said there was no need to review the election dates. “The DA does not agree that a review is necessary and we reaffirm that the party and voters are ready to go to the polls. The elections must proceed.” He argued that since lockdown, the IEC had been running by-elections. However, the EFF argued that going ahead was undemocratic and fascist. “It’s our firm belief that the declaration of elections means there can never be restrictions that seek to dictate to political parties how they conduct their campaigns. “Any attempt to do that would amount to fascism and suppression of democratic activity,” said Pambo.
