A VIDEO of a driving school instructor that left Mzansi in stitches has also opened wounds for some. While for some learning to drive and obtaining a driver’s licence was a smooth ride, others went through traumatic experiences. Mzansi is full of many driving schools, some legit and others not registered, and just owning a car and being able to drive doesn’t qualify people to be driving instructors. Before you can teach others how to drive, you first need to prove that you have an excellent command of the rules of the road and are also able to teach those skills to other drivers, which isn’t as easy as it might sound. The SunTeam asked readers about their experiences at driving schools and this is what they said on Facebook. Seipati Nodunjane said: “The worst trauma, sweating all the time… iyooh!” Lindway JustLindway: “I remember my first test, I got into the car, put on the safety belt, checked mirrors, the works. Hao, just when I started the car the guy was like FAIL! koloi e rolile and I was there like when and he was like tswa. I was shattered.” Precious Tungata: “I always wanted to look at the bonnet instead of the road, I hated inclines, my legs would start shaking when I was at the robots.” Boitsepo Tsepiso: “I was also shouted at by the instructor like she was doing me a favour. I gave up and I ended forfeiting my deposit. I moved forward with another driving school.” Cliveen Gee Linders: “I’m starting with my lessons today I’m super excited and also nervous, but I hope my instructor doesn’t shout at me. Nna I’ll shout him back.” Gerald Thamsanqa Louw: “I told myself I’ll never drive a car because I was so terrified of seeing myself driving. Until I saw an old lady driving past me and I told myself andinokoqhitwa ngulo makhulu (this granny can’t be better than me) the next thing I booked myself into a driving school. I’m a proud owner of my licence.”
