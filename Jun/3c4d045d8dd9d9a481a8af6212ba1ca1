Social media investigators worked hard this weekend,Â and may have as well approached VAR (Video Assistant Referee), to prove that Orlando Pirates star, Thembinkosi Lorch, and popular actress, Natasha Thahane, are dating, though unverified. With the PSL season currently on recess, many Pirates fans need not to ask themselves too many questions about Lorch's whereabouts as Twitter has enough evidence to suggest where he is, and with whom in the Zanzibar island. While other pictures shared on social were clearly photoshopped, but others look real, like the silver bracelets the two wore in a beach somewhere in the island. Much as it is debatable, but Lorch's image somehow reflects in Thahane's sunglasses, as if he's the person taking the picture. Lorch and Natasha's case is the biggest case in the country today.

Thahane is Archbishop Desmond Tutu's granddaughter and is famous for her role on SABC 1's Skeem Saam where she played in the role of Enhle.Much as they might deny it, but Twitter investigators might have got it right. Lorch's future with Pirates is currently uncertain as it's believed Mamelodi Sundowns are after his signature. ?? pic.twitter.com/RGMBmLMPEf Lorch and Natasha...
