Actress Ayanda Borotho has warned people about her hacked Facebook account. The former Isibaya actress took to Instagram to let people know her Facebook page has been hacked. Ayanda, who uses her social media platforms to voice her opinions about various issues, said jokingly that maybe she’s been hacked because she talks to much. “Please be aware. Nami maybe I talk too much mhlambe,” she wrote and added emojis, including a laughing one. The last post she had on the Facebook was about her thoughts on polyandry. She was neither for or against it. She wanted to understand why it was an issue of national importance, saying it’s up to people what they do decide what to do with their private parts.
