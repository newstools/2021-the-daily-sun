IT could easily be quite overwhelming for a youngster to wear the iconic jersey number 15 for Kaizer Chiefs. But that is not the case for 21-year-old, who dons the legendary No.15 jersey which was made prominent by Doctor Khumalo. Mshini, as he is affectionately known, has been using the retired jersey in Amakhosi’s CAF Champions League matches this season. This is because he can’t wear his usual jersey No.37 which he uses for domestic matches due to CAF rules. In continental football‚ squads are only allowed to wear jerseys that are numbered from 1 to 30.Ngcobo, who has been one of the standout players for Chiefs this season, insists that wearing the iconic shirt has been an inspiration for him. He is adamant that he has not felt any pressure, instead, he has been motivated by it. “To be honest this is motivation – a big one. I don’t take it as pressure but as a motivation‚” said Ngcobo. “Every time I wear that jersey, I remember what that jersey means. And‚ yeah‚ I just have to make sure that I bring my ‘A’ game every day to ensure that I take that number to the next level.” Ngcobo has played an important role in Amakhosi run to the semi-finals of the CAF Champions League this season. He will hope to continue his form when Chiefs face Moroccan giants Wydad Athletic Club in the first leg of their semi-final on Saturday (9pm) at the Stade Mohammed V. Ngcobo believes he has grown as a player since getting the opportunity to play club continental football. I think CAF has made me grow individually‚ but also as a team; it has given us different challenges, and I think we are managing them‚” added Ngcobo. “I think we are doing very well‚ and we just need to keep on improving every game.”
