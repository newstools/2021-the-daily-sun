FORMER Golden Arrows stars Papi Zothwane and Philani Shange have been appointed as coach and assistant at GladAfrica Championship side Uthongathi FC. Zothwane has replaced Pitso Dladla, who was sacked at the end of this season after The Cane Cutters could not mount a serious challenge for this season’s PSL top flight promotion. Dladla, who was the assistant coach to Ronnie Gabriel when Uthongathi won the Championship promotion ahead of the 2017-18 season via ABC Motsepe Play-offs, was appointed as the club head coach before last season was completed in the bio bubble. At the time, the KwaZulu-Natal club was at the top of the Championship, but couldn’t get over the line as Swallows came late and won it. This season, Uthongathi was expected to challenge, but they couldn’t too as they finished sixth on the table. This angered the management, leading to the parting ways of Dladla at the club. Shange has been part of the club since it got promoted to Championship, with the last few seasons being the skipper and playing as a right back. The 36-year-old from Inanda, Durban, who played for AmaZulu, Chippa United and Royal Eagles, was part of Golden Arrows side that thrashed Ajax Cape Town 6-0 in the MTN8 final in 2009. Zothwane, who left Arrows' DStv Diski Challenge team to join Uthongathi as Pitso Dladla’s assistant coach last year, played for Mamelodi Sundowns. He was part of the Tshwane giants that finished as runners up to Sundowns’ city rivals SuperSport United in 2009-10 season, before leaving the club at the end of the 2011-12 season.
