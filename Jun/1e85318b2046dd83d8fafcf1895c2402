Obed Baloyi is enjoying his role as Ringo on Mzansi Magic’s new telenovela, DiepCity. The actor best known for his role as Tsutsuma on SABC2 sitcom Ga Re Dumele said at first the new role was a bit challenging. “I had to make sure this character isn’t the same as my last one. They’re both funny. I had to switch and show versatility, but after some time I adjusted to it.” Obed told SunBuzz: “Acting is a calling to me, and when I stand in front of a camera and they start rolling, that spirit takes over. “Playing a character like Ringo is tough because sometimes you don’t feel like laughing. “But because this is my calling, whether I have problems or not, when I get on set I put them in my pocket and perform like there’s no tomorrow.” The actor, who’s best known for using his home language Tsonga, said it was important to stay true to himself in this cut-throat industry.

Maybe had I conformed to people’s norms I wouldn’t have made it this far.” He shared some tips for up-and-coming actors. “You’re as good as your last job. Make sure that every job you land, as small as it may be, you nail it and also be committed and love what you do. Lastly, never stop learning so you can keep up,” he said.
