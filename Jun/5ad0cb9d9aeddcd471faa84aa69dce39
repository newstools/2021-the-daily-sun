SHERIFF Masuku (55) did the right thing by stopping pupils from smoking on the street corner. But when he chased pupils of Thuto Bohlale Secondary School in Nellmapius, Gauteng, from his corner they went to another corner. The SGB gave him the go-ahead to search pupils for cigarettes, drugs and weapons. Since earlier this month he’s been keeping law and order. “It saddens me to see older people looking the other way when kids do wrong. I’d expect an older person to reprimand my kid. As parents we can’t be everywhere. “For the first week I found nothing, but the pupils told me to walk around the school fence. I found packets of cigarettes, loose draws and zol.” He said teachers have told him the kids are more focused in class. “I’m glad there’s some change. I’ve spoken to shops near the school to stop selling cigarettes to pupils in uniform.” His dream was to see a school where no pupil smoked or drank alcohol. “I have so many plans for the kids. I want to take them on a tour of prison so they can see how scary it is to be jailed.” Cosas’ Lewis Carter said: “These schools belong to us. We should be responsible for them.” Parent May Rabothata said: “I stay near the school. Every single day a queue of parents goes into the principal’s office. Now I hardly see any. “I think it’s because kids have no weapons to fight and are sober-minded and can’t start fights.” Another Parent, Malebo Kobela (50), said: “Sherrif has spoken with the tuck shop owner. He patrols the school grounds. I no longer see pupils smoking around the school yard.” Education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “He approached the principal with a concern about safety at the school and the principal engaged the SGB and was given permission.”
