A GIRL (13) allegedly stabbed a 16-year-old girl to death over a boyfriend. The incident which happened at Everest squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni, on Friday afternoon 4 June, has left residents shocked. Captain Johannes Ramphora of Springs Police Station said the suspect’s mother sent her to the spaza shop to buy some items. “She alleged later when the suspect came back into the house she saw there was blood on her nose and asked what happened. The suspect alleged she was fighting with a 16-year-old girl,” he said. The mother then went on with her work. Ramphora said the mother later heard noises in the street and went outside to check what was happening. “She saw the suspect and the deceased fighting in the street and ran to intervene but when she got there, it was too late.” The 16-year-old girl had dropped to the ground and blood was oozing from her chest. “She said she tried to help but the injured girl was taken by her family into a private car and they drove away.” He said the injured girl was taken to Far East Rand Hospital but she was declared dead on arrival. Residents told Daily Sun the girls had been fighting over a boyfriend. “We separated them the first time and the 13-year-old went home but the fight started later and the other girl was stabbed in the chest,” said a resident. “We are really shocked. We never thought one of them could end up losing her life.” The suspect, who had run away after the incident, was found and brought to the station by her parents. Ramphora said after questioning the suspect, she alleged she took a knife from a teenager she identified as Petros and hid it in her hoodie’s pocket. And when they started fighting again, she said she only wanted to scratch the girl on her arm but ended up stabbing her on the left side of her chest. “It was also decided to take the suspect to a place of safety for her own safety.”
