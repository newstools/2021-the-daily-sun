SHE was walking home from work with her colleague when her ex-boyfriend walked towards them. He asked the colleague to give them some privacy and Precious Sibanyoni sensed something bad was going to happen. Her instinct was right because her ex-boyfriend pulled out a knife and stabbed her. She screamed until people came out, and her ex-boyfriend fled the scene. The 31-year-old from Zone 7 in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane told Daily Sun she dumped the man in April, but he had been asking her to give him a chance. “I was tired of him. He cheated on me with a lot of women in our area. “I got tired and decided to leave him because I took care of him, but he humiliated me,” she said. But the man told her he would not lose her until they are both dead. That’s when he pulled out a knife and stabbed Precious. “I was nearby a clinic, so residents rushed me there and I got help,” Precious told Daily Sun. “I was bleeding all over. “I didn’t know what was happening. All I was thinking was that I was going to die,” she said. Precious said she was then taken to hospital, where she was admitted for two days. “I am happy I survived, but I don’t feel safe anymore. “I want the man found and arrested because my life is in danger,” she told the People’s Paper. “How am I going to walk in the street again when the person who almost killed me is walking free? “We are looking for him and I plead with the community members to help me look for him so that he can go to jail for what he did to me.” Precious opened a case against her ex, but the police hadn’t responded to Daily Sun’s enquiries at the time of going to print.
