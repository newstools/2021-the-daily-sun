TUESDAY, 8 June was a joyful day for residents of Mtubatuba in northern KZN. Mayor Thobelani Ncamphalala, accompanied by Premier Sihle Zikalala and Transport MEC Peggy Nkonyeni, unveiled various services. Among these were a traffic office, a driver’s licence programme, 150 traditional healers’ kits, as well as informal traders’ trading permits, tables, tents and chairs. Ncamphalala said: “This traffic office was supposed to be finished two years ago, but that didn’t happen because money was misused. Contractors would be given money when they hadn’t even laid a single brick.” He said the office, which initially had a R20 million budget allocation, ended up needing R34 million to build. “Our people are now going to access traffic office services like applying for learners and driver’s licenses closer to home,” he said. “They won’t have to pay a lot of money to travel to Hlabisa and uMhlabuyalingana to get services.” Nkonyeni warned traffic cops not to engage in any form of corruption because they’d be caught and arrested. “Don’t give driver’s licences to undeserving individuals in exchange for money. This is why we have so many accidents on our roads. Don’t do it. We’ll catch and arrest you,” she said. Zikalala said: “They’re now going to access traffic office services, and traditional healers now have the necessary equipment, considering that we live in a period defined by Covid-19. “We’ll also provide support to informal traders. They’re important in small towns as they create jobs. Traders are mostly women, and support from the municipality is quite important.” Resident Thenjiwe Mkhwanazi said: “We’re thankful for the support. It’s good when we see government coming closer to us with services that are meant to change our lives.”
