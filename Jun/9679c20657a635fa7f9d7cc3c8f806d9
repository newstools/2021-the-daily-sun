PSL acting CEO Mato Madlala says it is unlikely that fans and journalists will be back at the stadiums anytime soon because of the slow progress of the vaccination. Fans and the media are not allowed at the stadiums since the outbreak of the Covid-19 in March last year. But other sporting codes such as cricket, do allow journalists at their venues. Safa, the football governing body in the country, also allow journalists at games when national teams Bafana Bafana and Banyana Banyana are playing. Mzansi football giants Mamelodi Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, who were participating in the Caf Champions League and Confederation Cup, have also allowed a few journalists to attend their games. But the PSL has not changed its stance on domestic matches. Asked if there’s a possibility of allowing journalists and fans inside the venues this coming season, Madlala made an example about the ongoing Euro Championship which is taking place in 11 cities across Europe. In some stadiums, Uefa have allowed 25 to 30 percent of the capacity, while matches in Budapest, Hungary, have been played under full capacity with only vaccinated fans allowed to enter. “Go and vaccinate,” said Madlala. “If you look at what is happening throughout the world, they are coming back to the stadiums because they have been vaccinated. “When the time comes for you to vaccinate, you must go and vaccinate. We all do miss you, we all want to see you at the stadiums, but we can’t allow you guys without being vaccinated.” With games being played behind closed doors, clubs and sponsors have suffered the most. Maritzburg United have become the latest victim of financial deprivation due to gate takings. Club chairman Farook Kadodia said they lost up to R2m per game when his side are hosting big clubs such as Pirates, Chiefs and Sundowns. Kadodia is now considering selling the club as he has found the going tough to run it from PSL grants alone. Mzansi has so far jabbed more than 2.1 million people.
