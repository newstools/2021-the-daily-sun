PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation in yet another family meeting tonight, 15 June, at 8 pm. This comes after reports that Mzansi was at the peak of the third wave. In a statement released on Twitter, the Presidency said Ramaphosa would address the nation on developments in the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The President’s address follows a meeting of the National Coronavirus Command Council, the President’s Coordinating Council, and Cabinet. “As South Africa rolls out its national COVID-19 vaccination programme, government and social partners are continuously monitoring infection, treatment, and patient recovery rates, as well as compliance with health regulations and other prevention measures,” the statement read. Over the past two weeks, the recorded Covid-19 infections have been rising, and we are now peaking at over 4 500 infections per day. The President’s address will be broadcast and streamed on a range of platforms that are accessible to South Africans and international audiences.
