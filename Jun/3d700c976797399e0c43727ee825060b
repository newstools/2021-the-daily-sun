PREMIER Sihle Zikalala has called for order and calm following the diamond rush frenzy that hit a small village in Ladysmith, KZN Midlands. He said his government had noted with concern reports of illegal mining taking place at Hlathi Village. A number of people had gathered to mine what they believed were real diamonds. “We’re deeply concerned about the images showing people flocking to Hlathi Village,” he told the People’s Paper. “We’re worried that if not brought under control the situation could result in chaos and a possible stampede.” Zikalala called for order and calm and urged all those involved to cease their operations and to vacate the site so as to allow the department to conduct a proper inspection of the site. He said the matter had now been referred to the Department of Minerals and Energy. The department, according to him, had promised to send its own team of experts which would conduct a proper inspection of the area. Another team from the Council for Mineral Technology and the Council for Geoscience – comprising trained geologists – would focus on establishing the true nature of the stones. The premier said illegal mining could be in violation of Covid-19 regulations. It’s not the first time that such an incident has hit the province. In 2018, Daily Sun reported that Harding in southern KZN was in the grip of a gold rush. The stones, which had created much excitement among the locals and sucked in amateur gold prospectors from far and wide, turned out to be fool’s gold – a substance found in rock that looks like real gold.
