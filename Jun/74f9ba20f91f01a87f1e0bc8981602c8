Limpopo-born musician King Monada, who challenged Big Zulu to a celebrity boxing match, ambushed the Imali Eningi star on Tuesday, 8 June. He shared a video of himself driving to confront the hip-hop star. In the video, which was shared on his social media, the Malwedhe hitmaker can be seen trying to fight Big Zulu. But his crew, along with big Zulu’s, held him back from throwing punches at the star. But with all the drama and the theatrics Monanda was throwing, Big Zulu was unfazed.
