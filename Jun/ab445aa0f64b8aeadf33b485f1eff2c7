BAROKA FC midfielder, Kgodiso Monama, is going nowhere. The 24-year-old who joined Baroka from GladAfrica Championship side, University of Pretoria, said he enjoyed his debut season in the DStv Premiership last season. Baroka had a good season under coach Thoka Matsimela by finishing 10th on the log, but many of their star players have been linked with moves away from the Ga-Mphahlele based side. Other players who could join other PSL clubs are Goodman Mosele and Evidence Makgopa. Mosele has been linked with Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, while PSL defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns are reported to be after Makgopa. But the former South Africa Under-23 star, Manama told SunSport that he is staying with Bakgaga. “I am happy at Baroka and all I can say is that I will be with them next season. I’m happy at Baroka,” said Monama. On his debut season in the top flight, Monama said: “It was a good season. I think all went well for me. The reason the coach played me a lot means I was performing well. I am pleased with my contribution to the team. “I hope I can continue with this kind of form next season.” Matsimela, who was also in his debut season as a head coach in the top flight, played Monama 23 times. Monama scored once.
