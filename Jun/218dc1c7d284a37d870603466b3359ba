FORMER Orlando Pirates striker Phumudzo Manenzhe said Kaizer Chiefs made the right decision to part ways with coach Gavin Hunt. Manenzhe, who spoke to the media in Durban as part of the Pro Beach Soccer Launch, was baffled at how a team that came close to winning the league title last season completely collapsed this term. He said that Chiefs’ squad did not change much, as they lost only George Maluleka to Mamelodi Sundowns. Hunt, who was appointed as Chiefs coach on 17 September last year on a three-year deal, was sacked by the Soweto giants last Friday after the club lost 2-1 to Black Leopards in a DStv Premiership match. “A lot of people might be surprised but I, for one, I’m not surprised,” said Manenzhe. “Gavin Hunt inherited a squad that came second in the league in the previous season, barring the exclusion of George Maluleka who had left, the rest of the team was basically the same. “So for me, in a football sense, how can a team that finished second struggle to finish outside the top eight the following season? I find that hard to understand.” The pressure, despite taking Chiefs to the Caf Champions League semi-finals, was mounting on Hunt. He knew when he took the job that Chiefs could not sign players during the off season and also in the January transfer window, due to the club serving a Fifa transfer ban. When it was put to Manenzhe that Hunt couldn’t sign his own players and had to deal with the hangover of losing the league title in the final game of last season, he said, “play players to their strengths”. And the fact he was without club’s top scorer last season Samir Nurkovic for the first half of the season due to an injury, he said Hunt should have adapted to the situation. “Are you telling me Gavin Hunt was not playing these players to their best to finish outside the top 10? “Gavin Hunt has been in SA football for a long time so you can’t tell me what he needs to understand,” added Manenzhe.
