AVOID gatherings, especially parties! This is the heartfelt plea from the City of Joburg EMS’s Brendalee Mabaso. Brendalee, who received her Covid-19 vaccine jab last month, has encouraged people to register for the vaccine. Brendalee told Daily Sun she had a diabetic brother and almost every week they had to call an ambulance. “It was then that I knew I wanted to help people and save lives,” said Brendalee. She said through her career that started in 1994 she has enjoyed every moment of it. However, when the country was hit by the coronavirus, she said she became scared. “But as a leader I had to remain positive and bold,” she said. “Whenever I coughed or came down with flu, I got really worried. “But as a leader I couldn’t be weak and I trusted in God.” She said she and her team know they have to stay safe and protect not only themselves but also their patients. “We practice hygiene all the time by wearing masks at all times and washing hands regularly. Sanitising has become the new normal,” she said. “People still make excuses for not wearing masks. They often claim they left the house in a rush and forgot to wear a mask. It is disappointing to see people going to parties.” She said people must adhere to safety rules and regulations. Brendalee only suffered mild symptoms following the vaccine. “I never hesitated taking the vaccine although I was concerned about its side effects,” she said. “After a few hours I had mild body aches and just took painkillers. I urge the people to vaccinate to stop the spread of the coronavirus.”
