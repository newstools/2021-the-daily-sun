Firefighters in the Free State had to battle a truck fire on Wednesday afternoon after protesters allegedly threw a petrol bomb at the vehicle. Residents in the area have been protesting for weeks, demanding services and to be removed from the Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality. They have also demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa come to the area to address them. In a statement, Free State police spokesperson Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the N3 highway was temporarily closed to protect motorists. "A truck was thrown with a petrol bomb on the N3, but fire personnel managed to set it off. The situation is very tense around the N3 and N5 roads towards Harrismith."
