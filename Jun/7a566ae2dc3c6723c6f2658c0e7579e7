Franc Elis fashion brand has been invited to showcase his Spring-Summer 2022 Men’s’ collection at the Milan Fashion Week 2021, scheduled for 18-22 June 2021. This is a big global event in the fashion industry where renowned fashion houses like Giorgio Armani and Diesel showcase their lines to global fashion buyers. Owned by Cameroon-born designer Fabrice Moyo, Franc Elis designs and manufactures clothes in Gauteng from the Johannesburg Central District. The fashion label decided a few years ago to embed in their products labelling an attachment of Joburg as part of their label. This is in line with major labels found in creative and lifestyle destinations like Armani Milan, Hermes Paris, Tom Hilton London and now – Franc Elis Joburg. Gauteng Tourism Acting CEO Barba Gaoganediwe says this work represents a part of the collective effort by Destination Gauteng to leverage the brand status and standing of Johannesburg in the world. “This showcase will enable the destination to generate digital content that will continue the story through core created content that tells and not only sell. The virtual showcase is also a market access opportunity for the majority of Gauteng based designers in the global fashion circuit,” adds Gaoganediwe. For Moyo, this is an opportunity to show that South African designers and products can compete on a global market, and subsequently increase Johannesburg’s ranking status for both leisure and shopping. The Franc Elis’s showcase content was shot at Sandton City, an iconic Johannesburg landmark for shopping and lifestyle.
