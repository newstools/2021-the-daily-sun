RADIO and TV personality Thando Thabethe has opened her first physical store for her underwear and shapewear store, Thabooty’s. Thando shared the first pictures of her store that’s in Dainfern Square, north of Joburg. The How to Ruin Christmas actress was excited that she opened the store days before her 31st birthday. She asked for people to visit the store and thanked people who were part of making the store a success. Thando, who launched the store in 2017, has been operating online. This was until last month, when the actress posted a picture of herself standing next to her store saying it would be open soon. ALSO READ : WATCH: UTHANDO LODUMO SNEAK PEEK!
