GAUTENG is experiencing a third wave of Covid-19 infections. It’s expected the army will be deployed to the province to ensure regulations are followed and assist hospitals. The increase has been blamed on social gatherings and community protests. In 2020, the army was accused of abusing members of the public, and this time around soldiers will be limited to enforcing regulations. On Friday, 18 June, acting health minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said the army would assist with mass testing, screening and contact tracing. ALSO READ:

BASIC EDUCATION: SCHOOLS WILL REMAIN OPEN! “That’s why we’re urging parents to ensure their children are at home. Children shouldn’t go to parties because those are super-spreader events. Without the support of parents, we won’t be able to fight the virus,” said Zikalala. He said the vaccine programme had been going well. “Over 3 000 senior citizens and 1 000 health workers have been vaccinated. We call on all residents to get vaccinated,” he said. The premier said KZN had the fourth highest number of deaths. Simelane-Zulu said the teachers’ vaccination programme would begin on Wednesday, 23 June and run until 8 July. But those who don’t want to be vaccinated, for personal reasons, won’t be forced.
