RESIDENTS of Khayelitsha in Cape Town came out in large numbers to celebrate the life of a murdered teenager. Sinovuyo Magatya (18) from Zwezwe went missing after going out with friends on Sunday, 30 June and her body was found in an unoccupied shack on Thursday, 3 June. They described her as someone who loved life. Alizwa Mzi said Magatya loved everyone. “She was a lovely person who loved laughing and cracking jokes,” she said. Alizwa said everyone knew that whenever she was around they would laugh their lungs out. “Our wish is for the suspect to rot in jail. We cannot continue losing our sisters because of evil men,” she said. Another resident believes that men need to have a session where they would talk about what they are going through. Sinovuyo’s mum Nomfundo Magatya (62) said her wish was for her killer’s daughter to pay for what he did. “It still feels like a dream. I cannot believe that my last born is no more, said Nomfundo. Sinovuyo will be buried on 19 June in Maqhashu Village in Lady Frere, Eastern Cape. “I do not think she is resting in peace because of how she was killed, but I am praying that God gives me strength to face this difficult challenge,” the mum said. DA Councillor in Khayelitsha Thulani Dasa said they are deeply devastated and hope justice will prevail for the Magatya family. Dasa pleaded with young people to look after themselves. Magatya’s alleged killer made his first appearance in the Khayelitsha Magistrates Court earlier this week. NPA spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said the case was postponed to 24 June for a formal bail application. “The state will oppose bail, said Ntabazalila.
