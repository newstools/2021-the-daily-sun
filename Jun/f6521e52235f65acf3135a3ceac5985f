Media personality Somizi Mhlongo is all about money. He said if people shouldn’t just call him to chit chat. In a recent Instagram video clip, he said: “This message is for the over 45s. Guys, I don’t know about you but at my age at 48, I can’t stand phone calls just for fun. If you call me and I don’t answer, it’s either I’m ignoring it or I’m busy. But most of the time, chances are I’m ignoring it because I don’t like chit-chats conversations. If it’s that important and urgent, send me a text message and say ‘Somizi, this is very urgent. And it better be urgent.” He said if people want a quick response they should rather say: ‘Somizi, this is about money’. “In that case, I call you back but it better be about real money. At my age there is no time to chit chat,” he said. ALSO READ |   ACTRESS READY FOR MISS SA CONTEST Somizi’s clip revealed a handful of celebrities who also hate phone calls.
