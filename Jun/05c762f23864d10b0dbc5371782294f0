Three people died, including a pedestrian, in a gut-wrenching road accident on the N2 in Gingindlovu, KwaZulu-Natal, on Saturday night. Zinhle Mali, Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) spokesperson said police are still investigating the cause of the accident. “A vehicle was avoiding the pedestrian when it collided with another vehicle,” said Mngomezulu. The head-on accident resulted in the vehicles catching fire. IPSS Medical Rescue said when they arrived at the scene, the pedestrian and two people from a light motor vehicle had already suffered fatal injuries. One person who suffered injuries was treated on scene. “The collision allegedly occurred after a separate vehicle had struck and killed a pedestrian, causing vehicles to swerve to avoid the scene. “One vehicle collided with an oncoming vehicle,” said IPSS Medical Rescue in a statement. Gladwin Shandu, who was driving back home from work, said by the time he got there the vehicles were ablaze. “The people were already burning inside the car, there was really nothing we could do for them,” said Shandu.
