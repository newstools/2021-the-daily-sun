A GROUP of ANC members from the Madubula Nxumalo branch in Mpumalanga had to run for their lives during a meeting on Saturday, 12 June. An angry group stormed Manukuse Secondary School in Merry Pebble Stream Village, outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, and threw stones at them. The first group had gathered to elect new leaders and candidates for ward councillorship. At the previous gathering, members assaulted each other and had to be cancelled. Public order police calmed the situation, but members sustained minor injuries. Branch chairman and ward councillor, Obert Mathebula, said they learnt that some members were excluded from the membership list. “We decided to call off this meeting and can’t continue if the situation remains like this,” said Mathebula. One of the members told Daily Sun came about because the groups supported different candidates ahead of the upcoming provincial and regional conferences. “We’re not safe. Every time we come to the meeting, it turns into a fight among ANC members. We’re scared this fight might end in horrific deaths,” said the member. ANC spokeswoman in Mpumalanga, Sasekani Manzini, said. “We urge our members to exercise maximum caution and be vigilant at all times against agent provocateurs who want to disrupt the proper functioning of the ANC in the regions.”
