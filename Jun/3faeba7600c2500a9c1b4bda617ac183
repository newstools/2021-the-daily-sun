It’s scary and I’m afraid that one day, I won’t make it,” said Felix. The comedian fainted after his radio show on Wednesday. “This was not the first time. I once fainted while I was in studio. In these two incidents, I only woke up in hospital.” He said a doctor told him that his blood pressure was high and that he had too much cholesterol. “I’m taking it easy as I don’t want to pressurise myself. I don’t want stress and I don’t want anything that might disturb my healthy diet. I’m trying to lose unnecessary fat in my body,” he said.
