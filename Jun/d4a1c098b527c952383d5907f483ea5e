AMAZULU coach, Benni McCarthy, who led his club to runners-up spot in the DStv Premiership and a place in next year’s Caf Champions League, is already planning for next season. McCarthy is hopeful that they will sign right players who will be able to withstand the mental pressure of playing in the Champions League. Usuthu’s second place finish in the Premiership qualifies them for the Caf’s premier club competition for the first time in history. Due to the fact this will be their first appearance in the competition, AmaZulu will start in the preliminary rounds. McCarthy, who played in this competition with Orlando Pirates, said the squad he has currently cannot go to places like Egypt or Morocco and win matches. He emphasised the importance of signing players who have the right mentality to withstand the challenges expected in Africa. “Champions League football is something this club has to be very proud of and I’m sure every player must be looking forward to it,” said McCarthy. “To go to Morocco, Algeria, Egypt or Nigeria where most of us haven’t been before, will be a nice experience, nice opportunity. “But we are not going there just to add the numbers. However, we have to sign the right players.” But AmaZulu’s Caf party could be spoilt if Kaizer Chiefs beat Moroccan giants Wydad Athletic Club in the semi-final and win the competition. According to Caf rules, no member associations can have three teams in the Champions League. Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns are guaranteed their place in next season’s Champions League. But if Chiefs win the competition it would mean Usuthu missing out, as Amakhosi would defend the title. Usuthu, under McCarthy, have enjoyed a record breaking season finishing runners up for the first time in the PSL era and breaking the club record for earning the most points (54) McCarthy has warned his players about the Covid-19 pandemic and told them to keep safe in the off-season.
