SABC sport boss Gary Rathbone has slammed the monopoly SuperSport has on the broadcast right as ridiculous and unfair. As things stand, the public broadcaster will not show the upcoming British & Irish tour matches as the pay-channel has exclusive rights to the Springbok content, except on terrestrial SABC channels but not on OpenView, mobile and OTT. “Icasa has allowed this to continue. SuperSport can acquire the free-to-air rights and then come sell to the SABC on the terms that they set,” said Rathbone. “The free-to-air broadcasters should negotiate rights directly with the owners and not with the competitor acting as a gatekeeper.” The SABC has maintained that SuperSport-imposed sublicensing restrictions are prejudicial to the public broadcaster and its commercial partners as they limit the reach of the games to platforms decided upon by the TV rights holders. They’ve also argued that the restrictions also go against the spirit of the current broadcasting regulations that seek to ensure that all South Africans can access South African national sporting events, regardless of the platform or channel. “We are not allowed to put matches on sport channel and other platforms. “The Icasa regulations is divided between pay services and free-to-air services. Free-to-air means all you have to do is switch on your TV and you don’t have to pay a monthly subscription. You only pay your TV license, which is a national obligation,” said Rathbone.” According to Icasa, the Springbok matches are defined as national sporting events and those free-to-air broadcasters are mandated by the regulator to make such events available to the public. SuperSport owners, MultiChoice, say SABC rejected an offer they made to them. “The SABC now rejects terms and conditions, which it accepted when sub-licensing content of other sporting codes from SuperSport. This rejection deprives its viewers of watching the Lions Tour,” said MultiChoice in a statement.
