We can all agree that no day is complete without a hot cup of tea. Despite the daytime, tea plays an important role in many people’s lives. According tea experts, tea can be a powerful remedy for things such as headache, stress and ironically the heat. So, after that cup of tea, do you then dispose of that teabag? If you answered yes, then I suggest you keep your next one. According to One Good Thing magazine, there are innovative ways one can reuse their teabags. Let’s take a look at a few: 1. Refresh Your Carpets You can use the leaves from a teabag to freshen up your carpets. Just allow a tea bag to dry out, then remove the leaves. Stir the leaves into a big handful of baking soda, then sprinkle the mixture over dingy or smelly spots on your carpet. Let it sit for about 20 minutes, then vacuum the area thoroughly. 2. Take A Relaxing Bath Place one or two bags of tea in your bath water next time you take a soak. The antioxidants in the tea leaves will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated. 3. Reduce Under-Eye Circles Place them in your fridge to cool, then hold the bags against your eyes for a few minutes. It feels lovely, and the caffeine content will work its magic to shrink the blood vessels around your eyes.
