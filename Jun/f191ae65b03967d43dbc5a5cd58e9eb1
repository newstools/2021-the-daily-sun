MZANSI’S sexiest podcast Umjolo and Sex is back with yet another insightful episode. Hosts Mlungisi Mpela, Gomie Seabi as well as an expert will be discussing whether marriage is still relevant today. Mlungisi said the topic came in the wake of the controversial topic of polyandry. “We thought it would be best for us to touch on this topic and question the concept of marriage,” he said. “On the latest episode, people were torn on whether it’s okay for a woman to have more than one husband. “We thought if it’s one-sided and we’re going to fight about whether or not it’s okay, then why should we get married.” Mlu, as he’s affectionately known, also said this week’s episode of the podcast will leave people with a lot of questions and hungry for more. “Because of that we’re going to have a part two of this discussion. We believe that we need to add another voice and hear another perspective on the issue. On the next episode, we will continue with the topic but with a marriage counsellor and pastors. “We’d like to find out what exactly are some of the problems that people face in their marriages, especially since the start of lockdown last year divorce rates went up,” he said.
