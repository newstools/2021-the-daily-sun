Dear MizzB I AM a 26-year-old unemployed guy whose stepmother has been making moves on him. She walks around in her underwear when weâ€™re alone. Will my father believe me if I tell him?  Dear Brother I can imagine how frustrating it might be being caught up in such a situation. The challenge is that your stepmother might turn this around and pin it on you. It will not be easy for your father to believe you unless you have proof. Tell her to stop, and if she continues tell your father. Also, avoid being home alone with her. Good luck!
