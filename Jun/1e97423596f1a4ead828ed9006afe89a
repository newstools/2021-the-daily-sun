PROPHET Mduduzi Dube was supposed to tour Mzansi from 18 June until 28 July. But Covid-19 restrictions put a stop to the tour. Mduduzi, popularly known as Black Elisha, is known for locking punanis and 4-5s with his alleged spiritual padlock. Speaking to Daily Sun from Zimbabwe, the founder of Christ Life Generation Church said he uses his spiritual gift and scripture from Matthew 16:19 when he performs his miracles. “God told me to be a different prophet as most use water, oil and different things, so I was instructed to be unique and use a spiritual padlock. “People are still shocked by the miracles I perform using the spiritual padlock.” Prophet Mduduzi said he locks thieves, demons, poverty and cheating spouses. “I pray for a padlock and it changes to become a spiritual padlock,” said the prophet. He said he’s helped many people around the world. When he locks someone with the spiritual padlock, their partner has power to unlock it. “No, I don’t charge for healing and helping people. People give from their hearts whatever they can afford,” he said. Prophet Mduduzi said he’s called Black Elisha because he uses the angel which was used by Elisha in the Bible. One of the people he helped, Susan Phiri (45) who’s based in the United Kingdom, said her husband came back after 10 years of separation. Gladys Moyo (38) from Bulawayo said: “My yard was locked using a spiritual padlock and thieves were found still walking around in the yard as they struggled to see the gate.”
