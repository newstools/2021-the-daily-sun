The latest episode of Bongani Fassie’s reality show Finding Bongani has set tongues wagging. The talented musician who was part of musical group Jozi revealed he never knew had a relationship with his father. He said all the men who were in a relationship with his mother, iconic singer Brenda Fassie, were after her money. “Yes, they were in love but in most cases I saw that money was a big factor because when she was broke, they would disappear,” he said. “They tried being my stepfather but they did not last. The only two I can truly salute are Ludwe Maki and Nhlanhla Mbambo and I’m not saying stepfather as in they were married to Brenda but a father figure.” In the show, the star also tried to meet up with fellow Jozi member Ishmael, but the singer stood him up. He then started opening about the fact that he always wondered why people didn’t want to work with him. He said Da L.E.S, who was also part of the group, and others always talk and say he’s mad, unstable, or that he’s always high. “Others are scared of me,” he said.

He then shared the story where he had scored a big opportunity to work with Snoop Dogg but apparently someone he used to work with him stopped it. “Do you remember the Snoop Dogg story, when he wanted to take me? I went to one of his shows with my passport and he wanted me to pack my bags so we can leave.” But the next day he woke up to news headlines saying he had turned down the opportunity to work with the American rapper. Bongani also spoke about the fact that after his mother died, he started losing friends.
