IT is not hard for Themba Zwane to figure out why he relinquished his PSL Player of the Season award. Admittedly, the Mamelodi Sundowns midfield maestro could have done much better, by his high standards and talent. His teammate Peter Shalulile had a fantastic season, rightly scooping the Player of the Season as well as the Player’s Player of the Season awards. Zwane settled for the Midfielder of the Season gong and the DStv Premiership winners medal. But it could have been more for the Bafana Bafana international. “I could and should have done better. I can’t be happy with my contribution with the talent that I have,” said Zwane. “I was looking at my statistics and I was not happy in terms of my assists. I can’t have one assist with my talent. Even in terms of the goals, I could have done better, even though I had injuries, I could have done better. When I check the games, I had a chance that I could have buried. “Those are the things I need to improve on. “Even in terms of the national team I need to up my game and improve my stats... create and score goals and help the country do better. “Even though I was helping to defend, I could have done more. “I haven’t spoken to the new Bafana coach. But I’ve seen his work.” Zwane scored ten goals, five fewer than his target for the season.
