A TOP ANC member and member of the municipal public accounts committee in the Moses Kotane Local Municipality was arrested for allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl. The 56-year-old man appeared before court on Thursday, 24 June for bail application. He was granted bail of R1 000 to allow the prosecution to gather more evidence. The victim is believed to be the accused’s stepdaughter. The accused will appear again in court on 17 July. Acting North West ANC Women’s League secretary Bitsa Lenkopane said the league has vowed to fight abuse of women and children. Lenkopane said the perpetrator is said to be an ANC representative at the local municipality. The league calls on the ANC to immediately deal with the situation and the member by removing him from its list at the municipality and haul him to the disciplinary processes of the organisation. “We also call on the justice system to fully deal with the perpetrator and deliver justice for the vulnerable child. The league will, however, never rest until this barbarism is defeated and dignity of the people is restored,” she said. North West police spokesman Sabata Mokgwabone said they can confirm that the accused was arrested for rape. “He appeared in the Mogwase Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 22 June,” said Mokgwabone.
