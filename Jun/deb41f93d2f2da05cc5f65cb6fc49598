South Africa is experiencing the third wave of Covid-19, and our social behaviour could soon change if the current numbers are anything to go by. With massive gatherings being the most likely place to contract the virus, the party could soon move to the indoors where everyone is safe and social distancing can be better managed. While the throats continue to be open and the consumption of alcohol is done responsibly, there are games that can be played to ensure the fun continues indoors. According to Scoop Whoop magazine, these are the top three games to play during your bev time and all of them offer an outlet of responsible drinking: 1. Kings Cup Needing nothing but drinks and a stack of cards, Kings Cup is best enjoyed with a good number of people. Every time you pick a card, you have to do what the prescribed list says you must do. The list is done prior to the game. 2. Never Have I Ever Never Have I Ever is a great game to know your friendsâ€™ secrets! You have to share something that you have never done before and the people who have will take a sip of their drink. The key here is to make your friends admit their embarrassing stories, so watch out for what you say. 3. Flip Cup Flip Cup is a good starter for a house party. There are two teams competing against each other. Both teams stand on opposite sides of the table and keep their cups with drinks at the edge. Everyone must finish their drink and flip the cup with their fingers to the upside-down position before the next member begins. First team to complete this wins.
