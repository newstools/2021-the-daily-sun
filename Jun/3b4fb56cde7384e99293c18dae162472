MAPULA Modikwe is heartbroken. Her missing brother Abel was found dead on Sunday, 20 June. Abel (47) went missing on 12 April in Ga-Rasai in Jericho, North West. His body was found by a passerby in the bushes. The family claimed police have failed them and want Police Minister Bheki Cele to hear their plea. Mapula (49) told Daily Sun: “I’m sad. We’d hoped to find him alive.  “We suspect that he was killed. I’m really hurt. “I’ll miss my brother. He was full of jokes.” The family were still waiting for postmortem results and would announce funeral details at a later stage. “My brother wasn’t supposed to die like an animal,” she said. Colonel Adele Myburgh said an inquest case was opened at Jericho Police Station. “This is subsequent to an incident where the decomposed body of a 47-year-old man was found hanging from a tree at Ga-Rasai Village,” Myburgh told the People’s Paper. Abel leaves behind two children.
