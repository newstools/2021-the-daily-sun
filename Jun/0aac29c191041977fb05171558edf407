RISING amapiano star Lady Tee wants Mzansi to rejoice. The 21-year-old, who aims to make her mark in the male-dominated industry, has released a new single called Rejoice Yourself. Speaking to SunBuzz, Lady Tee, whose real name is Lethlogonolo Mogolane, said: “Rejoice yourself is one song that’s closest to my heart. I’ve been working on the song since last year and I’m glad that it’s finally out because I’ve always dreamt of having my own song. “A lot has happened in the past year and people had little to celebrate. “With this song I wanted to remind them that even with those little achievements, they should rejoice as it is important.” She said she enjoyed working on the song. “Working on the song was an awesome experience because I got the opportunity to work with two amazing producers that I look up to, Crazy Dee and Lapex,” she said. “I hope this song introduces me well to the market and hopefully I’ll win awards and also get international recognition. The aim is not only to make impact at home, but also abroad.” ALSO READ | DJ SBU: I LOST IT ALL The Pretoria-born star, who is inspired by the likes of DJ Zinhle, said she’s not in a rush to release an album. “Right now I’m fairly new in the game.

With the song I want people to dance until sunrise and forget that they have problems.” Lady Tee, who has been nominated for the 012 City Awards, said her journey has been amazing. “One day I would like to be where Rethabile Khumalo and Kamo Mphela are in life, as they are also my inspiration but I know through hard work and dedication I’ll get there.” Her single is available on all digital platforms.
