GATVOL residents from Emaholweni squatter camp in Nyanga, Cape Town destroyed a shack that allegedly belongs to thugs. This is because they have allegedly been kicking in residents’ doors and stealing their washing from the washing line. Resident Nomvuyo Sisani (45) said this started two months ago. “We were confused by how they vanished without being seen,” Nomvuyo said. “The shack these thugs live in was owned by someone we know. He went to the Eastern Cape two years ago and a stranger occupied the shack.” Another resident said more than 10 people met in that shack. “They started by smoking before stealing our clothes. They kicked down the doors while the owners are inside. “That’s when we decided to destroy this shack because they’re going to kill people for their belongings,” said the resident. Sandiso Manzana (40) said they didn’t want to beat or kill the alleged thugs, so they decided to destroy the shack. “They must go and do their criminal activities somewhere else,” said Sandiso. Another resident said that they didn’t report the incident to the police as they knew nothing would be done. “Reporting to the police was not going to help us in any way. This is the best option we had as long as we didn’t kill them,” said the resident.
