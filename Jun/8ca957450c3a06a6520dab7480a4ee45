WE are experiencing winter on this side of the equator, which means our interest in swimming or hosting pool parties is minimal. But after a few months, our views will change because of the warmer weather conditions that usually result in us going for a swim. When that time comes, think about this as a woman: Apparently, swimming can ruin your punani. According to Dr Aruna Kalra, a senior gynaecologist and obstetrician at CK Birla Hospital in Gurugram, chemicals that are present in the pool can disturb the pH balance of your punani. According to the doctor, a chemical called chlorine is often used to clean swimming pools because the water is a breeding ground for bacteria. This chemical is helpful as it kills bacteria in the water. However, not all bacteria are bad. A vagina has good bacteria that helps in keeping it healthy. But when you go into a pool, the chlorine kills the good bacteria, and thus disturbs the pH balance, she explained. ALSO READ: THE WORST PLACES TO HAVE TLOF TLOF! Dr Kalra said diving into the pool can cause the following infections on one’s punani: 1. Yeast infection Chlorine affects the pH balance of the punani and as a result, increases the chances of fungus to grow, thereby leading to yeast infections. 2. Inflammation Chlorine can also cause inflammation as it disturbs the pH balance of the punani. It may also cause allergic reactions in the vagina that makes it swollen or itchy. 3. Bacterial vaginosis This infection makes the vaginal area super itchy, and is accompanied by a smelly discharge. This may cause a lot of discomfort and pain. The discharge can also cause other skin problems on your punani.
