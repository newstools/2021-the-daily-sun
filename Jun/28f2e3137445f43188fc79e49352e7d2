The new lockdown regulations for level 4 will see many businesses closing their doors from Monday 28 June until at least 11 July. As a result, the DA has pleaded with the Gauteng government to keep gyms and fitness centres open so people can retain strong immune systems against Covid-19. Gauteng has been at the centre of Covid-19 with many cases reported in the province. The DA’s spokesman on sports, arts, recreation and culture, Kingsol Chabalala, said they had written to Gauteng Premier David Makhura, requesting him to provide evidence that Covid-19 has been spreading in Gauteng gyms and fitness centres and whether these are the reasons for their total closure during level 4 lockdown. He said they requested this information to be provided to them no later than Monday, 5 July.

The anxiety of trying to figure out how to survive the next month with a reduced income is unimaginable for some of us, but is the terrible reality for many others,” he said. Chabalala said closing gyms could lead people to have weaker immune systems and become more vulnerable to Covid-19. “The reality is since gyms and fitness centres were reopened in August last year. These facilities have successfully enforced strict compliant health protocols that ensured safe exercise for all members. To date, gyms and fitness centres have not been found to be super-spreader venues and are often more safe than the standard grocery store,” he said.
