AS it was expected, the PSl promotion/ relegation play-offs came to an end with another no show from Royal AM. The Durban side was scheduled to face Chippa United on Wednesday afternoon at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium (3pm), but they did not show up to honour the final match against The Chilli Boyz. Royal are involved in a court battle to have the PSL enforce Acting Judge Nyathiâ€™s order, which declared that the actions of the PSL to remove them from the top of the GladAfrica Championship was unlawful, and they should be reinstated They have boycotted all four of their Playoff matches in protest against the PSL, leaving Chippa to secure the final berth in next season's DStv Premiership after they took four points from their two games against Richards Bay. The Chilli Boys players went through the motions of appearing on the pitch for their clash in Gqeberha, but with no opponents on the other side of the field the referee started and ended the match with two swift blows of the whistle. The PSL and Royal look set to have a legal battle, with the club applying to the Supreme Court of Appeal to be reinstated as GladAfrica Championship winners at the expense of Sekhukhune United, while a PSL Disciplinary Committee could well be called to hand down a punishment to the no-show team.
