AWARD-WINNING gospel artist Babo Ngcobo has started an animal farming business in case his career goes wrong in the future. The Thixo Mkhululi singer sells cows, horses, goats and ducks from his home in Inanda, north of Durban. Babo told Daily Sun he got into farming as he couldn’t predict the future. “I can’t depend on music alone. I took time and thought deeply before I started this business. I realised that music lovers might be excited by my music, but in the future I don’t know if they will still love it and buy it at music stores.” Babo, who’s been in the music industry for 30 years and won many top awards, is one of the few gospel artists with money to show for his success. He said his farming business falls under his registered company, Ikhwelo Business Enterprise.

He said he wanted to spread his wings and look into other business opportunities in Inanda.  He also planned to build rooms to rent out. Babo’s still in the music business and is in studio working on his new album, Uhambo Three. When Daily Sun asked Babo about recent news that his big house, along with many others, was going to be demolished, he said: “My house is located under the land of Inkosi Mqoqi Ngcobo. He’s the one who gave me the land. My house is safe. No one will demolish it,” he said.
