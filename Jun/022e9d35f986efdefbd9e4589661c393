RELEGATED Black Leopards should stick with their interim coach Morgan Shivambu in the GladAfrica Championship if they are to return to the DStv Premiership. This is the opinion of Lidoda Duvha legend Coxwell “Magic” Ratshivhadelo. Leopards got relegated to the championship after finishing bottom of the log, and now Ratshivhadelo is appealing to his former boss David Thidiela to trust the 38-year-old to mastermind the return of the Venda-outfit in the top flight. “I don’t think Leopards have to hire a new coach,” said Ratshivhadelo, who retired from football and is now working as a prisoner warder. “Shivambu has shown before that he is the right man to lead Leopards. Shivambu knows Leopards in and out and knows what it takes to help this club return to the top flight. So I am just hoping the chairman can give him and Mongezi Bobe a chance.” Four seasons ago, Shivambu was Joel Masutha’s assistant when Leopards returned to the top flight after spending five years in the championship. Two seasons ago, the Malamulele-born mentor helped Leopards retain their PSL status through the skin of their teeth after winning the promotional play-offs. “I think Shivambu could have saved Leopards if he replaced Lehlohonolo Seema while there were still many games,” said Ratshivhadelo. “He (Shivambu) took over when it was already too late. I think Shivambu has gained a lot of experience and deserves a chance like many other young local coaches.” Ratshivhadelo said that Leopards could not have been relegated if they stuck with Shivambu after he helped them survive relegation two seasons ago. “Leopards brought new coaches and it was taking time for the players to understand their style of play,” he said. “But they knew Shivambu well and how he wanted them to play. But we cannot cry over spilled water. “It’s time to look forward and make sure we sign good players who are hungry for success.” Last season, Leopards had the likes of Patrick Aussems, Dylan Kerr and Seema as their coaches.
