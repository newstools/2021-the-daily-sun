SUNSPORT has been reliably learnt that Royal AM will honour their GladAfrica playoff match against Chippa United. This is despite the club CEO Sinky Minisi declaring that they will not set their foot on the pitch on Monday.Â "We are not playing any game. That is the only comment I have. Our legal stance is that we are not playing. Simple," Mnisi said on Monday. However, the second promotion/ relegation playoff match billed at Chatsworth Stadium on Tuesday afternoon (3pm) will happen. In a letter seen by SunSport to member clubs, PSL said there is no room for debate on the matter. "On 19 June 2021, the PSL confirmed that in light of Judge Roland Sutherland dismissing Royal AM Football Club's application for leave to appeal on 18 June 2021, nothing prevented the commencement of the 2020/21 GladAfrica promotion/ relegation playoffs. "The PSL was advised that the order of Nyathi AJ of 14 June 2021 suspending the commencement of the playoffs those "pending the final determination of Royal AM's application for leave to appeal and appeal those" no longer applied. "Nyathi AJ today handed down reasons for his order of 14 June 2021 and expressly confirmed that he handed down the order he did "pending the application before his lordship Sutherland DJP". There's no room for debate in the matter. 'The playoffs have commenced, and the second match of the competition will be played this afternoon at 15h00 at the Chatsworth Stadium between Royal AM and Chippa United Football Club." SunSport source at the stadium confirmed that the GladAfrica Championship runners up arrived at the venue to honour the match.""They arrived at the Stadium, and it looks like the match will continue as expected," said the source.
