AN uncle was slapped with three life terms for raping his niece on three different occasions in 2020. The 28-year-old man was sentenced in the Bisho High Court on Tuesday, 8 June for raping his 12-year-old niece. Eastern Cape NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakani said the girl from Ndevana in Zwelitsha, who lives with her mother, two aunts, younger brother and the uncle, was first raped in the evening when she was home alone with the uncle. “The uncle slapped her on the face, pushed her to a mattress and raped her. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone what had happened,” said Ngcakani. “The second incident occurred during the school holidays. The uncle, who was sitting with friends at home, told her to go buy him cigarettes at a shop. “When she returned from the shop the friends were gone. Again he grabbed her, closed the bedroom door, pushed her onto the bed and raped her. The child never reported the matter because he threatened to kill her. “The third time she was walking with friends from Cliff Location to Ndevana when they bumped into the uncle. He told her to accompany him to the shop but she refused. He then grabbed her, pulled her towards the bushes close to a bridge and raped her. “After he’d finished the little girl ran and told a passerby, and reported the matter.” Prosecutor Nocwaka Blorweni-Tokota, had proven the case beyond reasonable doubt. “The judge couldn’t find any compelling circumstances to deviate from the minimum sentence and sentenced the accused to three life imprisonment terms,” she said.
