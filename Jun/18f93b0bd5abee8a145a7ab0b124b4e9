Evidence Makgopa became just the second player in Bafana Bafana history to score twice on debut as the Baroka FC forward helped the side to a 3-2 friendly international win over Uganda on Thursday. Makgopa came off the bench to net two second half goals, the first a neat finish in at the near post the second an expertly worked low drive across goal after a fine team move. He follows in the footsteps of Katlego Mphela, who scored twice on his debut against Seychelles in the 2005 COSAFA Cup, and would go on to net 23 internationals goals in what turned out, in the end, to be a fine national team career. Makgopa was not named in the original squad by Bafana but was roped in after Percy Tau was ruled out due to a Covid-19 infection. But there are few who would begrudge the 21-year-old his call-up after an excellent season with Baroka FC where he announced himself as one of the hot properties in the DStv Premiership, and walked away with the PSLâ€™s Young Player of the Season award. He scored seven goals for Baroka this past campaign, but it was also his all-round contribution to the team, with his assists and high work-rate, that caught the eye. -SuperSport
