THEY may be worlds apart, but Kurt Zouma and Willard
Katsande would forgive those thinking they were born in the same family. The France and Chelsea star defender and Katsande, the Kaizer
Chiefs midfielder, bear such a striking resemblance that many thought the latter
was one turning out for France at the Euro 2020 finals. It is not only their looks that are similar, the two have
the similar physical appearance as well as the same aggressive approach to the game. Katsande hasnâ€™t quite enjoyed success on the international
stage with Zimbabwe, but he can bet he is rooting for Zouma at the current
European football championship. Zouma, on the other hand, has been a key figure for his English
Premiership side and has earned himself a recall into the French national team.
