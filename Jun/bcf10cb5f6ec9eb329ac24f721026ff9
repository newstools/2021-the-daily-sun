WHEN madala Titus Mlotshwa went to fetch firewood on Friday, 18 June, death was waiting for him. But he managed to escape by the skin of his teeth after six days of hell. The 79-year-old found two izangoma waiting for him in the bushes of Schulzendal in Nkomazi, Mpumalanga. He said they told him they wanted to kill him for muthi, and kept him in a big hole for six days. Following his disappearance, cops and community members went on the hunt for him. He was eventually found by soldiers near the Eswatini border. Titus said he believed God helped him find his way out of the hole.  He said he wanted the izangoma to be arrested and removed from the village.  His daughter Tebogo Mlotshwa (33) said they spent days looking for him. “We’re happy we found him, but we want everyone involved in his kidnapping to be arrested,” she said. Community member Nathi Lubisi claimed the izangoma confessed they were working with two colleagues, and members told them to leave the area. “We want them to leave before we do something we’ll regret. They’re very dangerous,” he said. Lubisi said residents engaged with the tribal authority and two of the izangoma had left, but two were still in the village. One of the izangoma had his ndumba burnt down by angry residents. ALSO READ: LOVE OF

Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that a missing persons case was opened, but that no case of kidnapping had been recorded yet. Hlathi said police were investigating two cases of malicious damage to property. He also called on community members to stop jumping into conclusions when they hear bad things about izangoma and reacting violently against them.
