TERRENCE Dzvukamanja’s late goal helped Orlando Pirates beat Baroka FC 2-1 in a DStv Premiership match at Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday to increase their chances of qualifying for next year’s Confederation Cup. Dzvukamanja came off the bench in the second half to head home Wayde Jooste’s pinpoint cross in the 88th minute to the delight of Bucs coach Josef Zinnbauer. This was after Bucs striker Gabadinho Mhango had cancelled out Denwin Farmer’s opening goal on the stroke of half-time. Pirates have now moved into third spot on 47 points from 29 matches, while the defeat dented Baroka’s hopes of qualifying for the MTN8 Cup since they occupy ninth spot on 34 points from the same number of matches. Bakgaga were eager to register their second ever victory over the Soweto giants having only beaten them in the Telkom Knockout final in 2019. Pirates beat them three times while 11 matches ended in a draw. Baroka coach Matsimela Thoka made just one change to the side that drew goalless with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila on 18 May as he gave Nhlanhla Mgaga the chance to start upfront behind striker Evidence Makgopa in the absence of Gerald Phiri who sustained a hamstring injury. His counterpart, Zinnbauer made six changes to the side that lost 1-0 to TS Galaxy over the weekend with goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands returning to the last line of defence as Siyabonga Mpontshane got injured. The first half became alive on the stroke of half-time when Farmer broke the ice with a low shot from inside the penalty box after Bucs defender Ntsikelelo Nyauza had cleared the ball into his path. A minute later, their joy was short-lived when Mhango levelled matters with a curling free-kick that deflected off Kambala’s head into the net giving keeper Oscarine Masuluke no chance. Meanwhile, SuperSport United beat Maritzburg United 2-0 at Lucas Moripe Stadium to increase their chances of finishing within the top five
