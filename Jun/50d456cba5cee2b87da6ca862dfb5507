FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs midfilder George Lebese has a lot of time on his hands. The 32-year-year old is currently awaiting his clearance from his former team in American, Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC. Lebese is not used to having as lot of time on his hands as a professional football player given the tough schedule he normally has. But as he continues to wait for clearance to return to the field of play, Lebese has used his free time doing fun things .He recently went Bungee Jumping, showing off his bravery as he jumped off a ridiculously high platform.
