MAMELODI Sundowns coach, Manqoba Mngqithi, says Peter Shalulile is one of the biggest revelations for the club. The Namibian international joined Sundowns at the beginning of the season from Highlands Park. His first season at Sundowns proved to be one of the best in as many years, which helped the club defend their Premiership title. For his efforts, Shalulile scooped the Footballer of the Season and the DStv Premiership Players' Player of the Season award during the of the season ceremony. He completed the season with 15 goals for Sundowns in 25 league appearances, a goal adrift ofÂ  Bradley Grobler, who won the Golden Boot Award with 16. Mngqithi said his professionalism is one of the reasons he is the best player in the PSL. Mngqithi said: "As much as I don't want to single him out and say he is the best signing and all that, the numbers and everything show that he delivered to the expectations of the club, even though I believe he could have done more," said Mngqithi. "More than that, the lessons we've learned from Peter Shalulile, which all of the players should have learned, is his high level of professionalism. "He is a very selfless individual, somebody who works for the team. He gives everything to the team, and for that, I regard him highly and whatever he has achieved in football is at the back of the person he is. "At training, he is never late. Every day he gives his best. Even when things are going well for him after scoring a few goals, he still fights very hard to do more than those who did not do better in the previous match. "And that is the quality that is going to help the whole group because everybody is learning a lot from him, and for those attributes and values I rate him very highly."
