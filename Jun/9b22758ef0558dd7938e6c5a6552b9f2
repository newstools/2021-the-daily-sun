SWALLOWS FC coach, Brandon Truter, revealed that they will lose about six regular players in the upcoming PSL window period. With that, the mentor believes they will also have to get it right in the market in terms of who they bring in to be among the top teams in the league next season again. The Dube Birds enjoyed their first spell in the DStv Premiership after winning automatic promotion from GladAfrica Championship at the end of last season. For a new team, they did fairly well for themselves, despite being draw kings as they played 20 draws this season, which is the new record of stalemates in the DStv Premiership.Swallows finished the campaign sitting in position six on the log with 44 points gathered from 30 matches. On Saturday, Swallows completed their maiden campaign with a 1-1 draw against Baroka FC. “Tough season, extremely tough. Mistakes we made, we had good moments and bad moments, but I am so happy with the guys’ performance,” said Truter. “Young players and technical team – we’ve learned a lot in our first season. We started like a house on fire, and teams started analysing us. It became tougher and more challenging because they had seen our weaknesses. Truter predicted a demanding second spell but remained optimistic that they will compete and do better than the recently ended campaign. He stated: “The second season will be more tougher, but we will have to get it right in the transfer market. It is going to be tough, we losing about six of the main players o started majority of the games so it is going to be another re-building process.” According to information gathered by SunSport, Swallows will be losing players such as Kgaogelo Sekgota, Ruzaigh Gamildien, Njabulo Ngcobo, and Sifiso Hlanti.
