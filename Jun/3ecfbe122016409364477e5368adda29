THE North West has been dealing with about 400 reported Covid-19 infections in the past seven days. A shocking number for the province where the elderly are not spared. With the aim of preventing further deaths of vulnerable citizens, scores of elderly people were collected for a jab in Ledig outside Rustenburg. They followed the normal process of vaccination and had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes before being released afterwards. Health MEC Madoda Sambatha said the past week had been a trying period for the province due to the spike in daily reported cases. Covid-19 epicentres Bojanala and Dr Kenneth Kaunda districts had the worst high cases. Sambatha said the province was standing at a current total of more than 6 800 active cases, which was alarming. “This raises a grave concern for the provincial health system as it points out to a potential crisis if our communities do not take preventative measures to curb the spread. We urge our communities to assist us to protect our fragile system by adhering to preventative measures,” he said. “It would seem our people have let their guard down. People are beginning to live as if we are back to normality. We see this in how shopping complexes, taxi ranks and domestic activities like funerals get overcrowded. This is likely to increase the number of new cases.” Sambatha also warned of a possible third wave, and continued to plead with community members to adhere to regulations by wearing masks, avoid crowded places, sanitising, washing hands and travelling less. The province has so far recorded 78 836 positive cases and 70 077 recovered, translating to 88,9% recovery rate. Unfortunately, 1 949 Covid-19 related deaths have been recorded to date.
