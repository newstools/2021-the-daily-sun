A 52-YEAR-OLD farmer’s penis has returned after mysteriously disappearing at a funeral! Though it mysteriously reappeared, Ghanaian publication JoyNews reported that the 4-5 was yet to start functioning. Narrating the incident, the farmer’s younger brother Issifu Yeliwa told the local news outlet that they were at a funeral when an unknown man approached them and complained of hunger. He said while they were trying to prepare food, the stranger unexpectedly touched his brother’s 4-5, which then disappeared shortly thereafter. ALSO READ: COPS MOERED NEAR TAVERN! Yeliwa said local izangoma told his brother to abstain from sex to enable traditional performances to work. “The penis has since returned, but I can’t tell if it will function as it used to or not. He has not been permitted to have sex at the moment,” Yeliwa told the publication. The unknown man who made the farmer’s penis disappear was later identified and taken to the police station. The matter was reported to Krachi East Municipal police commander DSP Aboagye. He said cops did not deal with spiritual matters and later saved the suspect from being assaulted by community members.
