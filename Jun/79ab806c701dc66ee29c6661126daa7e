NOMVELISO Mbawu-Tsotsa (42) is desperately looking for her cousin, Nokwanda Tube (37). Nokwanda disappeared from their home in Philippi five years ago, but Nomveliso can’t stop dreaming about her and it’s eating her up inside. Nomveliso said they’ve been to izangoma and prophets but haven’t found her yet. “They all say she’s alive but don’t say where she is. In my dreams she looks happy, but how can she be happy when she’s living without her family?” After she’d been missing for months, Nokwanda called her aunt in the Eastern Cape, saying she was in Tshwane. When they wanted to fetch her she asked them to send money for transport instead, but she never came home. The friend she was staying with told the family not to send more money since she’d use it for other things. Nomveliso said her cousin seemed as if she was having mental problem issues, and she still doesn’t understand if she was on drugs. “I don’t know what happened to her. She used to be an outgoing person who would go out and come back after even a week,” she said. “She used to go to clubs in the Cape Town CBD. “I suspect that’s where her problems started. Maybe she ended up taking drugs. “While at work we were told she claimed to be seeing sea water mixed with blood. “In a shopping mall she’d claim to be seeing water.”
