THE suspension of Ace Magashule should be lifted as it was unconstitutional, the South Gauteng High Court heard yesterday. Advocate Dali Mpofu argued before a full bench that the ANC had amended the party’s resolution that stipulated that members who were facing criminal charges arising from corruption should step aside. Mpofu relied heavily on the Ramakatsa matter where the Constitutional Court agreed that the Free State provincial conference was invalid and unconstitutional. Ironically, Ramakatsa had challenged Magashule and was represented by Mpofu. Mpofu said the ANC had not followed the legal process in suspending Magashule. He added that as a result Magashule was denied an opportunity to make representations before he was suspended. Mpofu said the party also ignored the warning of its former treasurer Mathews Phosa, who advised that the step aside rule was being wrongly applied. “Nobody says you must never suspend anyone,” Mpofu said in response to the argument that political parties should have the right to suspend their members. He said the party should be allowed to suspend its members, but it should be done within the confines of the law. “And if it’s a constitutional setting it must do so constitutionally. How do you do so constitutionally? By justifying that prima facie infringement,” he said. Mpofu further argued that by limiting Magashule’s participation, the ANC has infringed on his right to work and this was a violation of his rights.
