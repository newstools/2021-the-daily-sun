ESKOM has
announced that it is implementing stage 3 load shedding on Thursday, from 08:00
to 22:00. The power
utility says it will revert to stage 2 after 22:00 as previously communicated. In a
statement, Eskom said although there has been a slight improvement in
generation performance, there have been further breakdowns at Kusile Matla and
Tutuka power stations. “This is in
order to continue replenishing the emergency generation reserves, which have
been depleted. The emergency reserves are required to respond to emergencies in
order to maintain the stability of the national grid,” the statement read.
