FOLLOWING a protest by a group of Nigerian nationals in Mzansi over “exorbitant” fees for administration and replacement of lost passports, the Nigerian Consulate has clarified what led to the increase. Last week, the group staged a protest at the Consulate in Illovo, Joburg, over a R120 admin fee and R2 000 for a lost passport, an increase from R1 500. Nigeria Union in South Africa (Nusa) called for the immediate scrapping of the fees and labelled the extra charges illegal. On Friday, Consul General Abdulmalik Ahmed said in a media briefing: “I want to address the reintroduction of admin fees and charges for loss of passports, and more importantly to present our case in the face of some lies and outright falsehood against the mission by the disorganised Nusa.” He added that this was more necessary as these disgruntled elements had gone ahead to incite fellow Nigerians with intent to sabotage the mission. “Moreover, a live and falsehood often repeated amounts to a propaganda, which can be misinterpreted by the gullible and underscoring as truth.” Explaining the charges, Ahmed said the reintroduction of fees was sequent of approval from headquarters in Abuja. “On this issue, the mission could not unilaterally impose any charges without approval from headquarters. The admin fee of R120 pertains to all services rendered by the two missions.” Also on the issue of fees, another organisation Northern Nigerians in South Africa said it had carried out an investigation on the raised issues and stood with the Consulate.
