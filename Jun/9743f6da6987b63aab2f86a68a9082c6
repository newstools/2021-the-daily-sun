OUT-GOING Kaizer Chiefs may well play themselves into new deals with the fairy-tale Caf Champions League run. No fewer than seven players, including veterans Bernard Parker, Itumeleng Khune and Willard Katsande, will be out of contracts by the end of the week. But their course in the gold and black is not yet complete. They have a Champions League final coming up next month. Amakhosi sit on the cusp of history, having earned themselves a spot in the final where they will face off with Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly in Casablanca on 17 July. But will the rest of their squad be available to contest arguably the biggest match of their careers? “To be quite honest, we didn't discuss that, the focus was more on this semi-final, so the management will deal with that when the time is right,” said Chiefs interim coach Arthur Zwane. “So now it’s about going back to the drawing board and planning thoroughly for the final. Obviously, that will be part of the planning, in terms of the players’ contracts that are about to expire.” Another issue likely to pose a challenge for Amakhosi is that the club might not be able to register their recruits for the Caf tournament ending in the 2020-21 season. This could leave the club without enough players for the final, should the contract extension option not be exercised. In-form goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma, injury-prone midfielder Khama Billiat, Lebogang Manyama and defender Kgotso Moleko are also in the last days of their contract with Amakhosi. The club would neither be drawn on the contract situation nor the players they were bringing in. “As you may know we have a policy that we have to adhere to at the club. “We don’t deal with player contracts that have a question and answer. We will make an announcement regarding the contract,” said Chiefs communications manager Vina Maphosa. Emboldened by their gutsy win over Wydad Athletic, Amakhosi will be confident of clinching their first-ever Champions League trophy in Casablanca on 17 July.
