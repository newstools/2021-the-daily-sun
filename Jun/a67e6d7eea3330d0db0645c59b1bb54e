KEVIN Ndlovu, accused of killing his girlfriend and stuffing her body in a suitcase before burying her, will spend 18 years in prison. The 23-year-old man from Agincourt Village, outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, appeared in the Mpumalanga High Court in Mbombela on Monday, 7 June. He pleaded guilty to charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. He told the court he was in a relationship with Nokulunga Mbatha from 2012 and they had two children. “She visited me at my parental residence from Gauteng, and we had an argument because it appeared she had an affair,” he said. “I became angry and felt disrespected and humiliated. I then took an amplifier and hit her on the head. “She fell to the ground and died. I then locked her in the house and left her body for three days. Then I buried her in the yard.” The crime allegedly happened in February 2019, and four months later he confessed to his mother and led police to the shallow grave. He was arrested and released on R5 000 bail. Prosecutor Zwelethu Mata asked the court to take into consideration the nature of the offence. Said Mata: “Society requires protection from people such as Ndlovu in order to gain confidence in the criminal justice system. The deceased was young and still had her whole life ahead of her. “When the crime happened she was defenceless and unarmed. Therefore, a suitable sentence must be imposed to deter future offenders.” Handing down sentence, acting Judge Johanna Mthimunye said the killing of intimate partners in Mzansi was a serious problem. Ndlovu was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment for murder and five for defeating the ends of justice. “I order two years of the sentence to run concurrently, the effective sentence being 18 years’ imprisonment.”
