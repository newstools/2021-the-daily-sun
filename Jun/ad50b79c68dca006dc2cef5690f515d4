AMAZULU president Sandile Zungu couldn’t hide his elation after his side qualified for the Caf Champions League. Usuthu guaranteed them a second place finish this season, which is the highest number they have achieved in the PSL era, after beating Swallows 1-0 at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Wednesday. “You have absolutely no idea how happy I am, how thrilled I am... how elated I am. I can use all the words just to show my happiness. But really, deep inside, I’m so warm I should be crying actually," said Sandile. “You have outperformed yourself, you’ve gone beyond my initial expectations of what you could achieve this season.” This wasn't an achievement Zungu targeted when he bought the club in October. His target was to finish in the top four. In finishing second on the table, AmaZulu will only become the second side from Durban to play in the Champions League after Manning Rangers did so in 1997-98 season after they won the first PSL title the previous season. This is the highest ever points tally (53) achieved in the PSL. Usuthu went unbeaten in 16 league games. With their runners-up spot, Usuthu will pocket R7.5 million. “You have done it for yourself. We beat Swallows and became the second team this season to do so. Well done to you Usuthu. Hebe, Usuthu! Hebe, Usuthu!,” added Zungu. “Now guys you have cemented yourselves in the hearts of AmaZulu. "You have begun to write your names broadly on that white canvass which will be talking about the historic era of AmaZulu football club. You earned it, you deserve it. For me I’m humbled by your success." Usuthu will conclude the campaign with an away clash against Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday (3pm).
