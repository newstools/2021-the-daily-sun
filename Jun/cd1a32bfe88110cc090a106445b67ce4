THE City of Joburg’s MMC for health and social development Councillor Eunice Mgcina has tested positive for Covid-19. Director of mayoral communications Mlimandlela Ndamase said Mgcina received her results on Thursday, 24 June, after she was unwell for a few days. “She’s since urged people who might have been in contact with her to isolate or quarantine in their homes and ensure they remain indoors and minimise contact with other people,” said Ndamase. Mgcina asked residents to take the third wave very seriously. “Our health systems and facilities have begun feeling the strain and I urge all residents to heed calls to wear masks at all times, wash hands or sanitise regularly, and observe social distancing at all times,” said Mgcina. She said that she and her office staff would begin a four-day isolation period after which they’d undergo further testing. “I wish all Covid-19 patients across the city well, including Mayor Geoffrey Makhubo and chief whip of the city council Solly Mogase,” said Mgcina.
