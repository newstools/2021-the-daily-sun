MAMELODI Sundowns will be celebrating long into the night. The Brazilians finally got to hoist the DStv Premiership trophy high after they became the first winners. Downs wrapped up the title a few weeks ago but that did not stop them from finishing the season strong. They thumped Cape Town City 3-0 in the final match of the season at Loftus Versfeld Stadium to finish on a high. Their star striker Peter Shalulile bagged a brace while Lyle Lakay scored the other goal. The Namibian finished the campaign with 15 goals, narrowly missing out on the golden boot. SuperSport United striker Bradley Grobler edged the race with 16 goals. Nevertheless, Shalulile will be delighted to have won his first title after he joined the Brazilians from Highland Park at the beginning of the season. It was also the first title for a player like Jody February, although he did not feature much.  “I’m so excited,” February told SuperSportTV. “This is the first of many title in the colours of Sundowns I hope.” His coach, Manqoba Mngqithi was also excited to win his first lague title as head coach having shared the reins with Rhulani Mokwena. “It’s the most exciting day for me,” said Mngqithi. “The only thing that excites me is the gold medal. I don’t like silver.” Themba Zwane, who had another impressive season, was pleased to add yet another piece of silverware to his impressive list. “I’m happy for my teammates,” said Zwane. “Some of them its their first time but we managed to do it as a team.”
