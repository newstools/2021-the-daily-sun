KASI community members have given their local police station seven days to respond to their memorandum of demands. Residents of Langa, Cape Town, marched to the police station on Thursday, 24 June, to demand that cops allow safety patrol members to do their jobs without fear. This comes after police commissioner General Khehla Sitole spoke on TV and said the security patrol needed to stop posting photos of suspects on social media. Siyabonga Khusela, one of the founders of the #LangaForMen organisation, said: “Langa patrol members are not going anywhere. Instead of bashing them and saying what they’re doing is wrong in front of everyone, the police need to find a solution to work with them because we trust them.”  He said the tactic being used by the patrol was good because it was showing residents the people robbing them. Apostle Zongamele Baliso from Langa Pastors Fraternity said police needed to stop protecting suspects more than they did victims. “Hands off our patrol members. They’re always there when the community needs them, something we can’t say about police officers,” he said. “If there’s one thing we’ll die for, it’s the Langa Community Patrol. We can’t let the police bully them. “Find a solution to work with them instead of fighting what they’re doing. They’re here to stay.” Another concern raised was that cops allegedly drank on the job. Police had apparently been seen drinking in the shebeen with their uniforms on. Captain Adrian Kraumkap received the memorandum and promised to hand it over to the station commander. A resident said cops didn’t like the patrol because it showed how useless they were. Said the resident: “Why fight them they’re keeping the community safe? Everyone who’s been robbed knows patrol members are the only ones to go to.”
