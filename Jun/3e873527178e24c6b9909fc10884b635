Known for creating some of Mzansi’s biggest hip-hop songs, music producer AirDee has always known what he wanted to be. AirDee, whose real name is Edward Ramolula (30), told SunBuzz: “I’ve always known that I’d end up in music because I’m from a family of music fanatics. “I just didn’t know where the universe would place me within that realm.” He’s been making music since he was 16. “I started as a Sotho rapper, and got introduced to beat boxing and music production in high school,” he said. “That’s where I started realising I could make a living out of it. As my classmates gave me their lunch-box money for beats, I fell in love with the idea of getting paid for doing what I love.” Although his parents were sceptical about his dreams, the Bloemfontein-born producer followed his dreams. “The support from my parents took time because I was the first to break the generational curse and follow my real dreams,” he said.
