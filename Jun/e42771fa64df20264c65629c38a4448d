WHEN the Matlala Police Station outside Polokwane in Limpopo was severely damaged in a fire in March last year, cops had hoped it would be refurbished. But this has not been the case and officers working night shift are worried about their safety. They operate from a mobile office and wreckage of the damaged premises, which they said isn’t safe. One of the cops said they feared criminals would one day attack them. “Our lives are at risk, especially night-shift staff, because criminals can corner us in the mobile office and there’s nothing we can do to protect ourselves,” said the cop. “We feel forgotten by the police ministry.” He said they raised their concerns with police head office, but nothing happened. Another cop told Daily Sun it was difficult to serve the community as they must first ensure their colleagues are safe at the station before chasing after criminals. “When we go out at night, we usually call those who’re left at the station to check on them,” said the cop. “It’s scary here. There are no proper lights. We’re asking for a proper building.” During the fire, nine suspects in the police cells were safely transferred to Seshego Police Station. Office furniture and important documents were charred in the blaze. Resident Johanna Matlonya (48) from Tibane Village said the police were not as fast as they used to be before the fire. Daily Sun sent media queries to Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo on Wednesday, 2 June. He hadn’t responded to the People’s Paper at the time of going to print.
