FORMER Bizana Pondo Chiefs coach Tshepo Motsoeneng has helped BCM Stars win the ABC Motsepe League in the Eastern Cape region. BCM Stars are owned by Chippa United chairman Chippa Mpengesi’s son Sandiso, and recently roped in Motsoenefng and Morgan Mammila to help the team. Mammila, who was working as an advisor at DStv Premiership club Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), is the Stars CEO. Stars, who were known as Peacemakers FC, will now go through to the national play-offs. The play-offs, under the auspices of SA Football Association (Safa), will take place in Nelspruit from 28 June to 3 July. Motsoeneng, a former goalkeeper who won the league title with SuperSport United in the 2008-09 season, has warned other teams that they are coming to the play-offs to earn promotion to the GladAfrica Championship. “We want to bring the trophy home. We are going to (win promotion to the) Championship, and no disrespect to other coaches that will be there, but we have a team that is ready and prepared to fight,” said Motsoenefng. This  is a familiar scene for Motsoenefng who helped Eastern Cape based Bizana gain promotion to the Championship via the same route. However, the 42-year-old former Tornado FC coach was sacked in February this after being in charge for 14 games for Bizana where he won two, lost eight, and drew four.
