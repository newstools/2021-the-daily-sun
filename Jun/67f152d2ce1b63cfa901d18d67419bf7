SUSPENDED ANC secretary general Ace Magashule has put his faith in the judiciary to interpret the party’s step- aside resolution, which has led to him being temporarily suspended. Magashule intimated that should he not get any joy from the South Gauteng Hugh Court, he is willing to take the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal and if he doesn’t win there, he will take the case to the Constitutional Court. He is also anticipating that the party will appeal if it loses the case, which is set to be heard virtually for the next two days. Magashule also expressed willingness to engage with the party to resolve the matter, adding that he would die in the party. Speaking to the eNCA news channel from his hometown in Parys, Magashule said the court would need to interpret the party’s resolution and claimed that he and President Cyril Ramaphosa were in good books. Further, he claimed that he and deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte remained good friends, saying there were comrades who were wedging a divide between them. Magashule also mentioned that he would not be encouraging any of his supporters to attend the court hearing. His wish, he said was for the court to pronounce on the resolution. Magashule said he was not worried that he might be fired from the party and refused to be engaged on the issue of him suspending Ramaphosa, which infuriated some of his comrades. He said the court would have to make a pronunciation. “Let’s wait for the court matter. Let’s wait for ANC to deal with its processes. I’m not worried about anything, you can see I’m as fit as a fiddle. I am floating like a butterfly,” he said.
