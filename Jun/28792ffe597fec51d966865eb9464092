DURBAN dancer Senzosenkosi “Verb” Bhengu has claimed his spot in the national Red Bull Dance Your Style competition after winning the Durban title. Verb competed against 58 other talented dancers and his unique krumping style saw him through to the next stage of the competition. The 28-year-old from Avoca Hills in Durban told Daily Sun winning the competition was a dream come true because he’d always wanted to win it. “I know this is just the beginning, but I am over the moon that throughout the competition I stayed true to my style. I was able to fuse my krumping with the latest dance moves. I think that’s what made me take the title,” he said. Verb said the competition was tough as they were many talented dancers. Verb is the founder of Verbz Street Dance Academy, started in 2017. He said he lives and breathes dancing. He said: “I treat dancing as a career and I want to take it to world-class level just like other professions. I will go to national level and do what I do best.” The first runner-up, Londiwe Msomi (22), said she didn’t expect to be in the finals as she entered the competition for fun. “It was a tough competition and I don’t how I made it to the final because there were lots of talented dancers there. I’m happy that I got a chance to share the stage with them,” said Londiwe. The competition is touring around the country to look for the top 16 street dancers who’ll compete in the nationals in October. The winner will then go and represent the country at the Red Bull Dance Your Style world championship in December.
