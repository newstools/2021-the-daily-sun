POLICE are looking for two men who disappeared after the alleged kidnapping of eight people in Zandspruit, Honeydew. Captain Kay Makhubele said police launched a manhunt for Mali Dube, suspected to be involved in the murder of eight people and attempted murder of one person in Zandspruit on 19 May. Police were also looking for Given Mabodze, who could help police in their murder, attempted murder and kidnapping investigation. “Since the incident happened, the two wanted people haven’t been seen in Zandspruit,” said Makhubele. “Police are calling on anyone who might have seen these two people to contact their nearest police station or call CrimeStop on 0860 10111.” Residents of Zandspruit fear for their lives and want the men to be found. “If it’s not shootings at night, it’s little kids going missing and bodies being found. We’re tired,” said Hlelo Mbele (41). Samson Ngidi (51) suggested that there be more police patrols in the area.
