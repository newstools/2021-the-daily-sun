Mzansi’s sexiest podcastUmjolo and Sex is back again with yet another insightful episode. This week Mlungisi Mpela, Gomie Seabi and an expert will discuss sex toys and whether using a sex doll should be considered cheating. Speaking to SunBuzz, Mlungisi said: “I’m glad we’re having this conversation because in Africa, and in mostly South Africa, people have a negative perception about sex toys. “This is especially true for men, who consider them taboo. Being caught using a sex toy spells disaster.” Asked if using a sex doll could be considered cheating, Mlungisi said it was subject to interpretation. “I don’t think it’s cheating. But it’s more of a red flag because I might think I don’t satisfy you sexually. “But it’s subject to interpretation. It depends on how your partner reacts as some would consider it a good thing. “This is because in case they’re not around, they know you’re sorted and won’t seek sex elsewhere.” He said although people had negative perceptions about sex toys, they’re good in that you don’t contract STIs, and they’re convenient. But they also have their own downsides such as one ending up not enjoying sex or being overly dependent on them. “Having sex is a feeling process shared by both parties. Without it, one feels disengaged,” he said. Co-host Gomie said the episode was going to be spicy and disagreed with Mlungisi, saying there are no downsides to sex toys at all. “The toys can actually help you spice up your sex life and make you understand your partner and their sexual needs,” she said.
