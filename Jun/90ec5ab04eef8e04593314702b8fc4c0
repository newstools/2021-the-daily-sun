RENEILWE “Yeye” Letsholonyane may be known for his football qualities. But the former Kaizer Chiefs star is also a religious man. Celebrating his 39th birthday this week, Yeye penned a sacred message on his Instagram account, thanking the Almighty for the gift of life. “Thank God for a gift of life, for the family, for friends and family, for caring me through all good and not so good times, for the strength you give me and the ones I live to be the support system to me, thank you for another year of Grace. Happy 39th Birthday to me!” Even though he is currently unattached, Yeye has not announced his retirement from football yet.  Who knows? The former Bafana Bafana midfielder might play into his 40s and join the list of veterans such as Andre Arendse, the late Shoes Moshoeu, Siyabonga Nomvethe, Moeneeb Josephs.  “I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for the birthday wishes. I really appreciate them, and they mean a lot to me. Thank you. Thank you… Thank you” he posted.
