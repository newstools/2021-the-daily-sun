RAPPER AKA has returned to social media after a rough couple of weeks. The Finessin’ singer hadn’t used social media for his own content in almost two months and he returned, posting food, his dog and videos of himself. AKA took a break from social media and performing after his fiancee, Anele Tembe died in April. He used his social media platforms to send out statements as responses to abuse allegations against him, or to let his fans know how he is doing. Now he has been regularly posting on his Instagram stories and Twitter and he finally posted his dog on his feed and his fans sent him some warm messages. They welcomed him back and some asked how he was doing. Weeks after Anele’s death, allegations of abuse against the rapper arose. ALSO READ : RAPPER DISCOVERS CALLING FOR RADIO! He was accused of being abusive towards Anele, with videos of him making the rounds. This led to people thinking he had a hand in Anele’s death. A statement that AKA’s team sent to the SunTeam in May said the rapper was finding it hard to mourn and grieve with all the comments about him on social media. “Broken does not even describe an ounce of how he feels during this dark time. He is currently mourning the loss of the love of his life, someone he was building a future with and it’s not easy for him at all. It is also difficult to deal with the public outcry and condemnation on social media,” the statement read. It also stated that for this reason and because of the alleged abuse allegations, he would withdraw from the public space. He also had a tell-all interview with radio and TV newsreader, Thembekile Mrototo on 22 May, which left South Africans with more questions. A post shared by AKA (@akaworldwide)
