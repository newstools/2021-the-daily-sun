NATIONAL Under-23 assistant coach Zipho Dlangalala might find himself watching the Olympic Games on TV instead of travelling to Japan with the team. SunSport understands that coach David Notoane was made to choose one assistant to travel with owing to budgetary reasons. As a result, Notoane might travel with only one assistant in Kwanele Kopo for the games that will take place between next month and in August. Notoane’s life was made difficult, according to sources, after South African Sports Confederation Olympic Committee (Sascoc) said they will only pay for a certain number of technical staff members. If Safa, as the body responsible for the football team, wants to add more heads on the team, they will have to pay for them. When Dlangalala was appointed then, Kopo, who also coaches SuperSport United DStv Diski Challenge team, was working as assistant coach to then Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki. Safa CEO Tebogo Motlanthe said he is going to discuss the matter with Notoane. “I’m meeting coach Notoane and let’s not have rumours until we issue a statement,” said Motlanthe. SunSport tried to get comment from Notoane, but to no avail. Sascoc acting CEO, Ravi Govender, said as the mother of all sporting codes in this country, Safa is given its numbers like all the other sporting codes and will have to choose who they take with on tour. “Safa is given seven accreditations – for the team doctor, a physiotherapist and the other five they can use as they want to. “It can be the coaches and managers. In addition to that, they get another six positions but they must pay for it. So there are plenty of opportunities, we are not restricting football in any way,” said Govender. Meanwhile, Notoane has picked up Ronwen Williams, Abbubaker Mobara and Thabiso Kutumela as three overage players in the 22-man squad set to face hosts Japan, Mexico and France in the tournament’s preliminary round. Notoane is set to announce his squad officially in the next coming days.
