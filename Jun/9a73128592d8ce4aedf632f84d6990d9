Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Philani Nkwalase said the investigation into the case started in February. “It is reported that between 2015 and 2018, Maseti solicited payments from multiple individuals to the value that surpasses R2,3 million in respect of funeral insurance covers offered to the public. “Based in Khayelitsha, the businessman used Zwelonke Burial Services as a financial service provider without the required documentation, therefore contravening the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Service Act,” Nkwalase said in a statement. Meanwhile, acting provincial head of the Hawks Brigadier Mushavhaduvha Ramovha urged the public to be vigilant and guard their finances against unscrupulous people, ensuring that the entities they conduct business transactions with are operating legally.
