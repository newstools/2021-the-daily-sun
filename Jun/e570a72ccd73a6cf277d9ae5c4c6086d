LUNGILE Vilakazi (30) has lost her leg after the recent Harrismith protests. Lungile was part of the angry Harrismith residents who were protesting against poor service delivery and demanding the removal of Harrismith from the troubled Maluti-a-Phofung Local Municipality. She said she was run over by a police nyala when the police were trying to disperse protesters who were closing down the N3 between Harrismith and Warden. Speaking to Daily Sun on Tuesday, 1 June, Lungile condemned the police’s claims that she ran in front of the police nyala which led to her injury. “I was standing near a wire with four people when a police vehicle came straight to me. I tried to run but it was too late. It ran over me and I fell. “My leg was totally broken and doctors were left with no option but to cut it off.  “It is very difficult for me to admit that I am a disabled person. The driver of that vehicle came towards me deliberately,” said Lungile. She was admitted to Mofumahadi Manapo Mopeli Regional Hospital on Wednesday, 26 May during the massive protests at Intabazwe, Harrismith. Lungile asked SunReaders to assist her with finding an artificial leg so that she can provide for her kids. Police spokesman Brigadier Motansi Makhele said: “Protesters came in their numbers trying to invade the N3, but police were ready to prevent the situation from getting out of hand. In the process, a 30-year-old woman was unfortunately injured after she ran in front of the moving police nyala,” he said. The Harrismith shutdown was called off on Thursday, 27 May after a high level delegation from the Free State government led by Cogta MEC Thembeni Ngcangisa and Education MEC Tate Makgoe, accompanied by the senior officials, met all the partners.
