We feel like we owe it to give him the best send off. "He was well respected and descent man. "He was passionate about the club. He did everything without asking for payment. I remember we had an Operation Buyela ekhala. This is where we were the only ones who initiated it and he played a major role. This was for our kids to rally behind the club. We travelled across provinces to support the club, all for the love of the green and white colour. He helped many supporters to open branches. We need to give him respect that he deserves."
