SOUTH African rugby needs the fans to survive the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Without the fans, the Springboks will play in front of empty seats when they host the British & Irish in eight matches. The Lions are set to tour South Africa for eight matches, including three tests against Boks between 3 July and 7 August, and it appears the games will go ahead behind closed doors due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This will results in a huge loss in revenue, millions of rands needed to sustain the development of the game in the country as well as to keep the Springboks competitive. But SA Rugby president Mark Alexander is not giving up hope of getting supporters into the stadium for the upcoming tour. “We haven’t stopped lobbying government to get fans into the stadiums,” said Alexander. “We have pulled out all the stops. I’ll do anything we need to do to get fans into stadiums. It’s a process and you don’t know how long that process will take. That’s the problem. “But we can do that by having a certain number of fans in stadiums, with all the social distancing principle in place. “It’s important for us to have fans. Players don’t like running out and playing in empty stadiums. So we’re trying our best.” Alexander has cited loss of jobs which could result from the non-attendance. He has even suggested crowd funding to help speed up the vaccination process. “We need to have this tournament (the Lions tour with fans) in South Africa and if we don’t, there could be 10 000 jobs lost through retrenchments,” said Alexander. “You have a 90 000-seater stadium (in Joburg). If you have a minimum number of seats between each person, you’re covered. “We looked at several things to assist the government in raising funds to pay for the vaccine. We like the crowd funding thing and we wanted to start a campaign to raise money. We also proposed stringent controls around stadiums. We have (fans) tested before the game and people coming with their vaccine or health passports.”
