BAROKA FC chairman Khurishi Mphalele says the club will not be making many new signings ahead of the upcoming 2021-22 DStv Premiership season. On Wednesday, Baroka unveiled their new kit and announced eight new signings: Train Mokhabi (JDR), Akani Chauke (Sporting), Sekela Sithole (Cape United), Athenkosi Dlala (AmaTuks), Bayzel Goldstone (Richards Bay). The other three players promoted from DStv Diski Challenge are Bennet Bobete and Tshegofatso Bodega.  Meanwhile, Sydney Malivha was signed from Marumo Gallants (formerly known as TTM) Diski Challenge team. Mphahlele said they would retain players who were part of the team last season. He also revealed that they would release about six players. So far, he only confirmed two players whose contracts were not renewed. He said: "We parted ways with Tshediso Patjie, Matome Kgoetyane. Their contracts came to an end on Wednesday. We still going to part ways with about four players who did not play, we will release them so they can go elsewhere." "Over the years we have signed and released so many players and we have learnt the hard way. Now we need continuity." Mphahlele believes their new players will add value in helping improve their previous position, where they finished 10th. He said: "We feel that we need to beef up where we have been lacking. I believe these players will add value, if you check the previous seasons we did not have left wingers, we signed two of them and natural striker, (Evidence) Makgopa is a striker but we feel he can play as number 10 and (Richard) Mbulu as a winger, so Chauke is a natural striker that is why we signed him, he will add the needed firepower." "We are not going to lose anybody to other teams all the players are coming back and I believe we will be more stronger. All our players are still our players. If anything happens within the window period that would be communicated."
