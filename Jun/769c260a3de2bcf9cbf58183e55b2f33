REPORTS filtered through the community over the weekend that zama zamas had died in an explosion underground. And they were correct. Five bodies of illegal miners were initially found in Orkney, North West. Another 15 have since been recovered. And, none of the men have been identified. A number of mines have been abandoned in the Orkney and Stilfontein areas near Klerksdorp, which is where many zama zamas are found. Provincial police confirmed that they opened inquest dockets after 20 unidentified male bodies were found on Monday and Tuesday at various locations. According to police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone, the first five decomposed bodies were found at about 7pm on Monday outside an old and unused mine ventilation shaft in Lourens Park. “On Tuesday, 14 more decomposed bodies were found along Ariston Road near the railway line in Orkney. While still processing the scene, police received information that another body was found where the initial five were found,” said Mokgwabone.  “The dead are suspected to be illegal miners operating in obsolete shafts in Orkney and Stilfontein. They had suffered severe body burns. Post-mortems will determine the cause of death for these men, whose bodies were found wrapped in white plastic bags,” Mokgwabone said. “The investigation continues, including the possibility of linking the incident with the video that was circulated on social media of a man, calling himself Mafifi, pleading for assistance following an apparent smoke inhalation occurrence at shaft six.” China-African Precious Metals Mine CEO Robert Zhao said they were trying to bring in more security, but didn’t know how illegal miners gained access. “Some security officers might have been working with illegal miners. We need assistance from the police.” Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe said the issue of illegal miners was not his department’s, but the police’s.
