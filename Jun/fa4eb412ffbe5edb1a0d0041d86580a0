WHEN a sangoma gets into a relationship with another sangoma, certain rituals have to be followed. These were the words of Digital Bones sangoma, Nzama Maluleke. He shared this after SunReaders asked about relationships between izangoma. He said izangoma are also human and have feelings. “They’re allowed to love or fall in love. The only difference is that when a sangoma meets someone they want to be with, they have to introduce that person to the ancestors. “There’s a way that process is done. Izangoma know about it. They’re taught at training.” He said the same goes for izangoma who get involved with each other. “They have to follow the rules. They have to introduce each other to their ancestors.” Nzama said when they get married, their ancestors are combined. “That means their ancestors become one. They can even start working together in one indumba,” he said. There could be serious problems if that process isnt done and the relationship won’t last. “There will be a lot of fighting and they won’t understand where it comes from. It will be their ancestors fighting,” he said. Nzama advised that it’s important to follow age-old rules. “People today don’t care about the rules. They do what they want, which creates chaos,” he said. He said a real sangoma who went for training knows all these things and practises them. “Only fake izangoma will do as they please and end up messing up things, not only for themselves, but for those around them as well.”
