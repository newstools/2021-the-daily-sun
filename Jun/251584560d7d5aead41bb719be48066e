WHAT was meant to be a joyride in a stolen luxurious BMW ended in a shoot-out, leaving one suspect under police guard in hospital and another braving the cold cells at a cop shop. This after police and other law enforcement agencies pounced on a gang suspected of hijacking cars in Gauteng. The team arrested two suspects aged 48 and 49, and recovered a BMW reportedly hijacked in Alberton a month ago. The dramatic incident played out on Thursday, 3 June, in the East Rand. Speaking to Daily Sun, Gauteng cop spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said officers were following a lead on the wanted gang. “Gauteng police’s serious and violent crime unit received information about a gang responsible for stealing and hijacking cars in the Bedfordview and Germiston areas. A team then gathered to hunt down the suspects,” he said. “While keeping surveillance on the suspects, the team blocked a BMW with three occupants in Bedfordview. The suspects started shooting at the police. A shoot-out and high-speed chase ensued until the suspects were cornered,” he added.  Masondo said only two suspects were arrested while one fled the scene. “One of the arrested suspects was taken to hospital under police guard after he sustained injuries. Preliminary investigation revealed that the car they used was reportedly hijacked in Alberton,” he said. When cops made a follow-up on the address where one of the suspects was staying, they recovered car parts, implements used in car theft and registration plates of vehicles reported stolen and hijacked. “The manhunt for the suspect that escaped is underway and arrested suspects will appear at the Germiston Magistrates Court in due course,” he said.
