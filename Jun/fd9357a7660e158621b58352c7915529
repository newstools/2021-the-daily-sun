COUPLES who poke once a week are the happiest! Sex therapist Ian Kerner suggests that couples have sex with the goal of connecting at least once a week. In an article published by Business Insider, Kerner said the pandemic stress led to a decline in sex among couples, and suggested that poking once a week may help. She made these statements during a podcast called The Pregnantish, hosted by Andrea Syrtash – a New York-based dating and relationship writer. She further said couples who committed themselves to having sex once a week were more likely to be happy in their relationship, inside and outside the bedroom. “I think making that effort to hold on to sex is important, and not waiting until you get on the other side of something to get back to being sexual,” Kerner told Syrtash. The sex therapist said sex fell into three categories – just for fun, to feel connected to your partner and procreative or to have babies. She said it was important for couples to have relational sex once a week as it helped them bond and feel closer to each other.
