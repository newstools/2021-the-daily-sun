Musician and aspiring actor, Thokozani “Lvovo” Ndlovu, has abandoned his mission to lose weight. Instead, he will be focusing on eating healthy and being fit. In 2017 he had always maintained that he would never lose weight because it’s part of his brand. But in 2019 after losing his breath while performing at 033 club in Pietermaritzburg, he changed his mind and decided to lose the fat. At that time, he told Daily Sun’s sister magazine, Drum, he has always been an overweight child and this never bothered him. “But in the past few years I started having health problems. I consulted various doctors and they said my body could not support my weight anymore. That night at the club was the first time I ran out of breath. It means I can’t dance too hard because my body can’t take it,” he had said. After consulting with doctors he had to make drastic changes which included losing weight.

Unfortunately, lockdown started and I had to observe its restrictions. I gradually went back to my weight. Since then I’ve never been able to go back to gym. I’ve lost the fight to lose weight and I’m not going to try it again.” He said before lockdown, he was doing well and had started seeing results. “From now onwards I am going to focus on my health. I am still going to exercise but the aim will not be to lose weight but to keep fit. Being fit is important for me because my body is my tool. I need to have stamina on stage.” He said he’ll also be concentrating on his acting career. “I’m currently shooting with Durban Gen. I was head hunted and I am playing myself as Lvovo. My character will be appearing in the next few weeks. For now I can’t disclose much about my it except that it’s an interesting character. I have a couple of episodes which means it’s not a brief appearance,” he said.
