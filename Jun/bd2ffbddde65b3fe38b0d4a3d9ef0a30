POLICE spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo has confirmed the dismissal of Major-General Jeremy Vear on Friday, 28 May. Naidoo said: “Veary was subjected to a disciplinary process following social media posts he made of messages and images between late last year and earlier this year and caused the same to be circulated via the social media network.” ALSO WATCH: WOMAN SAYS I DO TO THE HOLY SPIRIT! He said some of the messages were directed at national police commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, and contained words that were considered derogatory, offensive, insulting and disrespectful to Sitole. “These actions were considered misconduct in terms of the police service’s disciplinary regulations and therefore warranted a departmental action,” said Naidoo.
