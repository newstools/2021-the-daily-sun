FORMER president Jacob Zuma will see the inside of prison cells but not for his full sentence. This is according to the bones of Solly “Mahlasela” Mathebula who said Zuma will be arrested after five days. “He’s in South Africa and police will arrest him. “There will be a fight between police and MKMVA, who’re supporting Zuma at his home in Nkandla,” said Mahlasela. “There’ll be pointing of guns between the police and the MKMVA, but there will be no bloodshed.” He said in Gauteng there will also be some fighting as Zuma has many supporters. “He’ll be arrested in KZN and serve a sentence in Gauteng prisons,” he said. “He’ll serve between three and four months and will be released due to medical conditions. “Zuma doesn’t want to go to jail because he believes he’s innocent. “Even some among the Guptas will be arrested. “Zuma will also go down with some top ANC members and there will be a lot of finger-pointing. “His son Edward will also be arrested for trying to defend his father. “There will be protest and looting in North West and the ANC will be divided into two this year.” Mahlasela said Edward will be arrested between 12 and 13 July. Traditional healer Koketso “Mahlalentabeni” Maubane (23) said Zuma will go to jail but not for long. “He’ll see jail but won’t be there for the full duration of the sentence. “People who support him won’t be happy and a fight will erupt,” said Mahlalentabeni. Traditional healer Thabang “Mahamba” Malebye said Zuma will not go to jail because there are people who’re prepared to die for him.
