BLACK Leopards will bounce back to the DStv Premiership! That was the assurance from co-coach Morgan Shivambu after Lidoda Duvha were relegated to the GladAfrica Championship after losing 3-1 to Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium in their penultimate Premiership fixture on Wednesday. Leopards demise happened just days after they gave themselves a lifeline when they defeated Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 last Wednesday, a result which saw coach Gavin Hunt sacked by Amakhosi. Leopards will end this season at bottom of the table, even if they beat Bloemfontein Celtic at Thohoyandou Stadium in their final match tomorrow (3pm). “It’s not the end of Black Leopards,” said Shivambu who stepped in with co-coach Mongezi Bobe after the club fired Lehlohonolo Seema earlier last month after losing 3-0 to Orlando Pirates. With the match against Celtic just a formality, Shivambu said the game will form part of their preparation for next season. “Yes, we are going down to the Championship. But in the match against Celtic we will be looking at how we are going to regroup in the Championship,” said Shivambu. “I liked the fighting spirit in the first half against City and the mentality of our never-say-die attitude. We need to take it to the Championship next season so that we can come back.” Leopards struggled in the relegation throughout the season. They sacked Belgium coach Patrick Aussems, appointed on 4 October and fired him a month later, after he lost the opening three games. They then reappointed Dylan Kerr in November. But nine games with nine points Kerr was gone (two wins, four losses and three draws). The club then appointed Seema in January. But he was let go in May after 17 matches, winning four, losing 10 and drawing three with the return of 15 points. The club then called Shivambu and Bobe to steer the ship, but they couldn’t save Leopards from the drop into the Championship. Last season they survived via the promotion/relegation play-offs after finishing second.
