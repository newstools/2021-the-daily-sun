SUPERSPORT United youngster, Jesse Donn, finally got a taste of regular action this past season and now he wants more. The 22-year-old midfielder broke into the Matsatsantsa a Pitori side in the latter stages of the season, forming a solid partnership with Teboho Mokoena in midfield. Donn played 11 games, starting nine of those in a row. This was a huge progress for the youngster who only played six times the previous season. Donn, who joined United in 2019 from Ubuntu Cape Town, had to bide his time before imposing himself on the senior team. And now that he seems to have fought his way into the side, he intends to hang on to his place for dear life. “This season was very different to the first. It started similarly actually with me being on the bench and not getting any game time for the first half of the season, but things changed dramatically in the second half of the season,” said Donn. “The coach gave me a chance to play against Cape Town City and I managed to start every game from then until the end of the season. It felt great to be a consistent starter and to see all the hard work and patience finally paying off. “The games I managed to play recently helped me to grow in confidence and maturity, and that will certainly prepare me well for next season. Hopefully, I can translate this game time into more minutes next season and contribute to the team’s success. “I enjoyed partnering with Tebza (Teboho Mokoena) in the midfield during the final 10 games. He is a great player who can pretty much do anything. I think we work well together as I don’t mind doing a lot of the dirty work and then giving him the ball to take us forward.”
