FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s daughter Dudu Zuma-Sambudla, who normally tweets on matters pertaining to her father, hinted in a tweet that her father has accepted his fate and would hand himself over. “Amandla! Just spoke to my father. @PresJGZuma is in high spirits and has no fear. We have a choice between serving our time in Jhb or Nkandla…Of course we have chosen to be close to home. Lockdown or no lockdown we will escort you to serve your time,” she tweeted. Earlier on Tuesday, 29 June, the Constitutional Court sentenced Zuma to 15 months in jail, saying he was in contempt of court when he failed to appear and participate at the State Capture Inquiry. His spokesman, Mzwanele Manyi, said it was a sad day for the country that the court had taken such a decision. He said what made matters worse was that the judges didn’t unanimously agree on the appropriate sentence. Amandla! Just Spoke To My Father, @PresJGZuma Is In High Spirits And Has No Fear. We Have A Choice Between Serving Our Time In Jhb Or Nkandla…Of Course We Have Chosen To Be Close To Home. Lockdown Or No Lockdown We Will Escourt You To Serve Your Time. ????????? pic.twitter.com/Yrybea4Skt  “It’s a sad day today. It’s a sad day because some judges are saying the judgment is unconstitutional. If judges are saying that, what do you expect to be the attitude of Zuma? I think we have a crisis,” he said. He said it seemed the other judges seemed to be gatvol with Zuma and made an emotional decision. Manyi didn’t say where Zuma was when the judgment was handed down. “I’m not at liberty to disclose his whereabouts, but he must be shocked wherever he was,” he said.
