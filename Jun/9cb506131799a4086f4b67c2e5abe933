The chances you’re surrounded by nosepickers are high. As nasty as it sounds, some people eat their mucus. A recent study revealed that 91% of adults admitted to picking their noses regularly. If you eat the gold you have mined for, it might be bad for you. The mucus is mostly made of water, gel-like proteins that give it that slushy consistency, and special immune proteins that fight off germs. Those immune proteins are especially useful because the mucus is packed with harmful viruses such as influenza. They serve as your body’s front-line defence against invading germs. When you breathe in, you’re not just inhaling air, you’re also taking in bacteria, viruses and dirt. According to a BusinessInsider video, if you decide to eat the mucus, you’re putting yourself at risk of infection. Because as your body digests the booger, it can release those harmful germs into your system. The video also suggests that scratching up the inside of your nose opens the door for a nasty bacteria that lurks under your fingernails called Staphylococcus aureus.
