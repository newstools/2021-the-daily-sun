INTERNATIONALLY acclaimed playwright Mbongeni Ngema is cooking up a new show whose cast will be made up strictly of people living with disabilities. Mbongeni said he realised people living with disabilities were always left behind, and he intended to end this by giving them a chance on his play, God Bless The Music. He said the play’s main aim is to give youth living with disabilities a chance to show their acting talents. “The play is about a woman living with a disability,” said Mbongeni. “She can’t talk but has the brilliant talent of playing the piano. “I initiated this play from the realities of the lives of the women living with disabilities in homes for the disabled.” The creator of the acclaimed theatre showpiece Sarafina! said a lot of talented disabled people out there are not acknowledged in theatre. He’ll use people living with various forms of disabilities. Mbongeni told SunBuzz: “I’ll take people living in homes for the disabled and cast others through auditions in all provinces from July I’m looking for 30 people living with disabilities who’ll be part of the play. We won’t consider the type of disability, as long as they’re able to do something.” ALSO READ |TRIBUTES POUR IN FOR ACTOR LUZUKO NTELEKO He said the play will be staged in December, but he was still deciding whether it would premiere in Joburg or Durban. He recently finished My Song For Mandela, a play about Mzansi’s first democratic president Nelson Mandela, for which he’d received blessings from the Mandelas. “I plan to showcase the Mandela play on Broadway in New York in the United States of America in September,” he said. “Everything is in order. I just hope that Covid-19 will not stand in my way.” He recently released a new 25-track album titled Vintage. “I features about 100 top musicians including the a cappella group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, jazz pianist and composer Themba Mkhize, singer Mandisa Dlanga and many more,” said Mbongeni. The album is available on all digital platforms.
