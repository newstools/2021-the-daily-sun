THE Proteas left for the Caribbean last night for their tour of the West Indies. Among the travelling contingent was Mandla Mashimbyi, the Titans coach, who has joined the national team on an interim basis. Mashimbyi is filling in for Enoch Nkwe, who is on family responsibility leave. He was the assistant coach at the Titans from 2013-14 and took over from Mark Boucher when he joined the Proteas in his new role as the head coach. However, Nkwe will join the team for the T20 leg of the tour. The Proteas are visiting West Indies for the first time in 11 years for the series that includes two Tests in St Lucia and five T20 matches in Granada. “It’s going to be a challenge for every one of us going, but I’m sure everyone will be ready to go once we start the series. I know there’s going to be a lot of emphasis on preparation going forward. That’s the one thing we can control at least,” said Proteas captain Dean Elgar. “We are all excited to finally be back to playing cricket again. It has been such an up and down period and as players, we have been frustrated by having limited access to be able to play international cricket.” Elgar will be returning to the Caribbean, having first toured there in 2016 for the triangular series against the West Indies and Australia. He added: “I did not play any game then, but I got to see what kind of conditions were on offer, although it was a different venue to where we are going to play this time around. “From my knowledge, reading and hearing what our management has come up with already, it seems like St Lucia is quite a low and slow kind of place with regards to the wicket. We will have to assess when we get there and acclimatise accordingly. “It is something that we have been preparing with our camp that started. The big factor for me is going to be the adaptation factor once we get there and once we leave the hotel and start training as a group.”
