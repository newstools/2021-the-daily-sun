MZANSI Magic drama series Abomama is coming back for another season. But the sad news for fans is that lead actress Khanyi Mbau, who plays the role of Tshidi, won’t be a part of the new season. Her role has been recast and she’ll be replaced by choreographer and actress, Khabonina Qubeka. Actress Nozuko Ncayiyane, who played the role of Lumka, has also been recast, with Busisiwe Mtshali set to take over in the new season. Other new additions include Nandi Mbatha, Asavela Mngqithi and Senzo Radebe, among others. According to the channel, viewers can expect more thrilling drama as the women try, separately, to move on with their lives following Bonanza’s murder. But they’re forced back together when a naked, young woman who suffers from amnesia mysteriously arrives on the steps of Hope of Glory Church. Mapule, played by Nokuthula Ledwaba, sees the woman as an opportunity for them to find redemption for their past deeds. This while Raki, played by Masechaba Moshoeshoe, is instantly doubtful. Soon after, it becomes evident that there’s more to the woman than meets the eye. ALSO READ |  ZODWA WABANTU WANTS A BIGGER 4-5! Speaking to Daily Sun, director of local entertainment channels Nomsa Philiso said she was excited about the return of Abomama. “The producers have taken a group of women that many of us can identify with, and put them in an impossible situation that will make us question our moral boundaries,” she said. “As Africa’s most-loved storyteller, we always try to treat viewers to compelling content that will resonate with their lived experiences in an informative, entertaining and educational way.” Khanyi left the show after a thrilling first season that left viewers on the edge of their seats. Later this year, she’s expected to appear alongside Renate Stuurman in the Netflix romcom Happiness Ever After – the sequel to Thabang Moleya’s 2016 box office hit, Happiness is a Four Letter Word.
