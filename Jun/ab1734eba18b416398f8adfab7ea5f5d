 Congratulations are in order for Babes Wodumo and
Mampintsha. It’s Youth Day and the couple welcomed their
baby. Mampintsha posted a picture of his wife and their bundle of
joy with the caption: “Imithandazo yenu isebenzile ngyabonga”. Mzansi has been showering the couple with congratulation
messages and well wishes. Some are even happier that he shared this image
with his fans. “We can’t wait to see his little face,” said Prudence
Mnisi. Some are already asking when these two are making a second
baby. They said they look cute together and can see that they’ll
continue making beautiful babies. “I’m happy for you. We love you so much,
please shower that baby with love. We can’t wait to see the next baby bump,”
said Muhle Masina. Lerato Masepa wish Babes a speedy recovery. She also
said she prays that post-partum depression doesn’t affect the way she raises
her baby. “A lot of woman go through this and if it happens to hit
you, just know that you’re not alone and we love you behind measure,” said
Lerato.
