HARD luck. I am taken. Those were the words of Nomalizwi Mhlongo, formerly known as Mlungisi Mhlongo. Many people can’t tell that Nomalizwi, who is transgender, was a man. She’s gorgeous and very confident. When she enters a room, men turn their heard and women become jealousy. Many men have tried their luck but unfortunately, she is taken. She told the People’s Paper that she’s madly in love with her man. Although she did not want to reveal his name, Nomalizwi from Umlazi in KZN, said he treated her like a queen. “I love my man and we are happy together. He’s amazing,” she said. Nomalizwi started her transgender journey more than 10 months ago. “The journey is exciting. I’m loving the changes.” She said her breasts are starting to show. “The beard is also going away,” said the excited Noma, as she’s often called. Talking about her childhood, she said she grew up in Umlazi. “I did not live with my parents because they were working. I was raised by my relatives. I so wish I was raised by my parents. I encountered abuse at the hands of a close relative whom I saw as a father. Instead of protecting me, he molested me. He raped me. Those flashbacks still haunt me,” she said. When she completed matric, she studied teaching and eventually got a teaching job. She said there are people who are still not educated about homosexuality. “Some people have been educated but there’s still room for improvement. There are people who still mock us. We need to work together to put a stop to that.” MALAWI COURT RULES AGAINST MZANSI! The socialite, who also is also an MC, urged young people to never be ashamed of who they are. “I wish I had come out early in life to show who I am. It’s emotionally draining having to hide yourself,” said Nomalizwi. Her long-term wish is to mother children, not only her own, but those who do not have homes. “Children are at the centre of my heart. I love them and I want them to be safe at all times,” she said.
