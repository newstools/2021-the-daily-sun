HER two-month-old son was admitted to Bernice Samuel Hospital in Delmas, Mpumalanga, for diarrhoea. But he ended up losing his left arm. Dineo Mathebula now wants justice for what she claimed was negligence by the hospital. She told Daily Sun her ordeal started on 18 June when her baby was put on a drip, but it kept falling out. On 22 June, the drip fell out again and a doctor allegedly put it on her baby’s foot. Dineo said while bathing her baby on Friday, 25 June his arm was swollen and had changed colour. “I took off the rubber band and called the doctor and nurses,” she said, adding that she wanted the hospital to take full responsibility,” she said. “My son was transferred to Steve Biko Academic Hospital for an emergency operation. “My son has no arm because of negligent doctors. I’m trying to be strong, but I’m failing. I want the hospital to pay for what happened.” There was a similar incident at the same hospital in April, where a three-week-old baby who’d been admitted for diarrhoea was transferred to Witbank Hospital after complications led to the amputation of the hand. Three doctors and a nurse were suspended after the incident. Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said an investigation was under way. “We’ll give more details once we have received a full report on the matter from hospital management.”
