Government is grappling with the problem of people who sell their RDPs prematurily. This irresponsible, desperate act undermines government plans to supply subsidised housing to the poor. You qualify for housing assistance from government only once. Selling one’s RDP is a smack in the face for government, whose intention is to eradicate homelessness. The worst part is that beneficiaries who sell the houses are often vulnerable people who may not be able to acquire a home of their own after selling the RDP. It’s common for some to return to shacks. A house is an asset, one that can take the poorest of the poorer out of poverty and free them from a debt trap. It doesn’t matter whether that one has been living in that house for more than eight years. It’s unacceptable, period. Letter by Norman Maake Tembisa
