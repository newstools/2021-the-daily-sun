COPS are slowly closing in on the gang terrorising residents of Plessislaer in Pietermartzburg, KZN midlands. This comes after they arrested four more suspects linked to the gang in the early hours of Sunday morning, 6 June. According KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele, an intelligence-driven operation was conducted this morning in the Alexandra area to search for the outstanding suspects. “The police team which has been tracing these gang members received information of the whereabouts of the gang. The team acted on the information and went to a lodge that is situated on Woodhouse Road. The lodge is not far from where seven suspects were fatally wounded by cops during a shoot-out last week,” said Mbele. She said the team pounced on unsuspecting gang members and arrested them. She said each suspect, aged between 18 and 30, was found in possession of an illegal gun with rounds of ammunition. “The arrested suspects are linked to a string of murder cases that were committed in the Pietermaritzburg, Imbali, Richmond, Bergville areas, as well as with cases of robbery, rape and assault with the purpose of causing grievous bodily harm. The suspects will appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court tomorrow (Monday),” said Mbele. KZN provincial commissioner, Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said: “We will not rest until we arrest all those that are linked in causing the instability in Pietermaritzburg and in the province. Our operations are still ongoing and all those that are involved in these criminal acts, including those high profile individuals (business people and politicians), will be arrested.”
