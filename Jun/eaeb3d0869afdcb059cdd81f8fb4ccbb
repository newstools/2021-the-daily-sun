THE Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa in KZN has called on the health department to stop mixing psychiatric patients with normal patients in general wards. The union said if they continued to do this more patients and healthcare workers would be hurt. This follows an incident at Estcourt Hospital in the KZN Midlands on Thursday, 24 June where a mentally ill patient was filmed while being beaten up by security guards. The organisation’s provincial secretary, Mandla Shabangu, said such wards are not adequately equipped. “The patient may either be endangered or endanger other patients and healthcare workers,” said Shabangu. They found it strange that following the incident, three nurses had been suspended with the two securities involved. “While we condemn the behaviour of the security guards and the manner in which they handled the incident, we’re aware that this is caused by the dismal failure of the department,” said Shabangu. He said for years they’d been complaining about the mixing of patients in general wards whose nurses were not trained to deal with psychiatric patients and their behaviour. “This mixing of patients doesn’t only pose a threat to nurses who’re not trained to manage them, but also is a threat to other patients. “Just three years ago a psychiatric patient admitted in a general ward at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi woke up and attacked a fellow patient. The patient died.” He said the department failed to teach security guards responsible for such patients how to manage violent patients. He said the organisation would put pressure on the institution to immediately uplift unfair suspension of its members.
