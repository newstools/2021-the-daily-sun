SIX SOLDIERS are expected to appear in the Musina Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 23 June, for alleged corruption at the Beitbridge Border Post in Limpopo. The suspects, aged between 30 and 51, were arrested on Monday by the Hawks after they allegedly colluded with vehicle smuggling syndicates to smuggle stolen vehicles. Hawks spokesman, Captain Matimba Maluleke, said: “It’s reported the suspects would demand R15 000 per vehicle that would be shared among themselves. This endangered the majority of their honest colleagues. “A project-driven investigation dubbed Night Vigil was instituted to probe the matter,” said Matimba.
