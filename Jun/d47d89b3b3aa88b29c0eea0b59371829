TAXI DRIVERS have earned a bad rep for their behaviour on the road. In a video that has gone viral, a taxi driver can be seen in what looks like a mall exit that has a beam. It seems the beam was not functional and the man thought it would be a great idea to forcibly push the beam up to drive through. As he tried to drive through the beam, he realised it was too low for the taxi to pass. He then comes out of the taxi and breaks the beam, completely removing it. At the corner of the CCTV footage it shows the incident happened on 25 May, but itâ€™s not clear where the incident took place.
