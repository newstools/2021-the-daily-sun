Residents from Vlei squatter camp in Samora Machel are
shocked after they woke up to three bodies scattered on their streets. Each body of the
three men had a bullet hole on the head. Residents who spoke to the SunTeam said the incident
happened around 2am as they heard some gunshots. “It looked as if there was a delivery car that came to
deliver bread at the spaza shop during that time. After it left, it was when we
heard the gunshots. Because we stay in shacks when you hear a gunshot you don’t
run to check but rather get under the bed for the fear of stray bullets,” said
resident Nozibele Dyani (44) from the area. Residents believe that the deceased men were shot at close
range because they all had bullet one bullet hole on the head. Only one
cartridge was found on the murder scene. The residents further said what worries them is that nobody
can recognise the faces of the deceased persons. “Whatever that
happened, what were these people looking for in our area in the middle of the
night. It means they came from other areas to our area for reasons we do not
know. Maybe to commit crime, people have been trying to identify their bodies,
but none seems to know them,” said another resident who did not want to be
named. This happened a few days after seven people were shot and
killed in Gugulethu area earlier this week. Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said they have
implemented the 72 hour activation plan to probe the death of these men. He
said the age of the deceased is estimated to be between the ages of 20 and 25. “At around 06:30 the bodies of the three victims were
discovered in the road in Vlei informarmal in Samora Machel, each with one
gunshot wound to the head. The motive for the murders is yet to be established
and an appeal is made to any person who can shed light on the circumstances to
kindly contact Crime Stop on 0860010111,” said Traut.
