DESPITE objections, Zulu King Misuzulu met with his sister Princess Nombuso, the daughter of his father’s first wife Queen Sibongile Dlamini, on Friday 25 June. The meeting raised eyebrows as Sibongile and her daughters had taken the royal house to court. Traditional prime minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi advised against the meeting, leading to Princess Thembi accusing him of trying to separate the late king’s children. The pair had a one-on-one meeting at a hotel in Durban. Nombuso told Daily Sun going to court didn’t mean royal house members were enemies. “I met with him to discuss royal matters as King Zwelithini’s children and to advise him as his older sister. “I will not give comment on whether we discussed settling out of court. We are united as the royal family and only have differing opinions.” King Misuzulu’s spokesman, Prince Thulani, told Daily Sun Buthelezi only stopped the meeting from taking place at the KwaKhethomthandayo Royal Palace. “Their discussions were centred around finding an amicable solution in terms of bringing unity and a sound working relationship as the children of the late king,” he said. A few weeks ago, Princess Nombuso, Princess Thembi and Prince Mbonisi held a media briefing where they made it clear they did not recognise Misuzulu as king. In May, a legal bid to stop the coronation of Misuzulu was adjourned without final judgment by the Pietermaritzburg High Court. Princess Nombuso’s younger sisters, Princess Ntandoyenkosi and Princess Ntombizosuthu Zulu-Duma, made an application to stop the coronation and wanted the execution of the late king’s will to be suspended. Sibongile demanded 50% of the estate, claiming she was the only one of his wives married in a civil union.
