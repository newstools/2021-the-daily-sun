REALITY TV star Dabula and her fiance Alpheus Maseko keep surprising Mzansi. Though South Africans love them, they believe music is just not for them. This after a viral video of the couple performing at an unknown location left Mzansi in stitches. Some people had thought Maseko was joking when he announced he’d be joining the music industry. Many will know the two from Umndeni, a reality series about a man who’s married to multiple partners. During one episode, Maseko announced he’d join the industry, even giving a special performance during the reunion show. Many people thought the performance wasn’t bad while others thought he should just stay at home and take care of his wives. Although many viewers loved Dabula, they didn’t think he should pursue music. Sphiwe Michael said: “We really love you Dabula, but girl you need to sit down. I’d also like to talk to whoever booked them.” Nancy Mokoena encouraged him to stop Maseko from performing. “I hope she won’t take offence because this is positive criticism.” Sipho Elvis said: “He’s entertaining enough on Moja Love. There’s no need for him to embarrass his wives like this. He needs to stop.”
