Orlando Pirates will hope to secure a  top three finish on the final day. The Buccaneers have been rather inconsistent this season which has been a source of huge frustration for their supporters. Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has come in for some criticism as a result from some supporters. But the German tactician, who did lead Bucs to the MTN8 title earlier this season, will hope to finish on a high note. And a spot in continental football next season could go a long way in appeasing the Bucs supporters. The Soweto giants only need a draw on the final day to confirm participation in Africa. A defeat, however, could see them finishing fourth on the standings. They lock horns with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the DStv Premiership match at the Orlando Stadium on Saturday (3pm). “The season is not finished. But we have to work on a lot of things and I’m happy now we have now a better performance than the last game," Zinnbauer said after his side's 2-1 win over Baroka on Wednesday. “We have a lot of chance of course and if we score earlier and more then we make it easier for us and then you get more self-confidence for the next game."
