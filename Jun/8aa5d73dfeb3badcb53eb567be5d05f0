THE little girl who was kidnapped on Monday, with a ransom of R50 000 being demanded for her release, has been found dead. Bokamoso Shabe (eight) from Thabong, Free State, was allegedly snatched by an unknown woman after she was last seen at Mmantshebo Primary School in Jerusalem Park. Her grandmother then received two calls from kidnappers using the same number, demanding R50 000. The family was told that she would be killed if the money was not paid. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said a search led to a discovery of the girl’s body on Thursday. Makhele told Daily Sun: “Since she was reported missing, the Lejweleputswa District team, consisting of various units, worked tirelessly to search for her.” On Thursday at about 2.30pm, the team came across a gruesome scene when her body was found.
