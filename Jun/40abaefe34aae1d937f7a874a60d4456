Top designer Thula Sindi has become the voice of informal traders. Taking to Twitter on Thursday 17 June, Thula said the way the City of Joburg and Metro police treat informal traders is not how a world class African city would do it. Thula was responding to the City of Joburg’s notice which was put up on Thursday morning by Councillor Tefo Raphadu. It requested the public to comment on a draft informal trading policy of the City of Joburg. According to this notice, the objective of the informal trading policy is, among others, to define and integrate a holistic approach to informal trading for all of the city’s departments and municipal owned entities.
