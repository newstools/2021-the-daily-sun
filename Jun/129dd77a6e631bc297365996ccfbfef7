THE Hawks arrested seven suspects at the crack of dawn on Thursday in Gauteng. The criminal network was responsible for large-scale prepaid electricity fraud and theft. Provincial spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Philani Nkwalase said the investigation started in May 2020 in Bloemfontein, Free State. It probed the illicit sale of electricity facilitated by vendors who had illegal electricity vending machines in their possession. The syndicates reportedly operated in groups nationally and generated income of about R150 000 to R250 000 a day from illicit sales of electricity.  “They’re highly organised, well-equipped, closely networked and difficult to track down since the machines don’t transact on a network or single place,” said Nkwalase. “They’re constantly roving. The suspects were allegedly responsible for selling illegal electricity to prepaid customers.” The illegal practice of selling prepaid electricity results in multimillion-rand losses to Eskom per annum. During their arrest, one suspect allegedly tried to bribe the officers with R100 000 and was charged with bribery.
