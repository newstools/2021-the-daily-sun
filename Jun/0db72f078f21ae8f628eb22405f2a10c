GOGO Josephina Thobolo wants the body of her son, who was recently buried at his father’s house in KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, to be exhumed and brought back home The 64-year-old gogo from Sengatane Village in Moletjie, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, said she hasn’t been able to sleep since her son Lefton (29) died on 22 May. She said her ex-husband left with another woman to start a new life in KwaMhlanga earlier this year. Josephina told Daily Sun she wanted closure as she wasn’t allowed to see her son’s body or to bury him. “I always see my son in my dreams. I believe it’s a sign he’s not resting in peace and was supposed to be buried here at home.” She said Lefton left home last month to visit his father. “I got a call on 22 May from his father, informing me he’s not feeling well as he was vomiting non-stop. I said I’d come the next day since it was already late,” she said. She later had a vision that Lefton had died. “I told him I’d avail myself as soon as possible, hoping to take my deceased son to a mortuary of my choosing.” Josephina said when she arrived her son had already been taken to a mortuary of his father’s choosing. “I asked him to take me there so I could collect my son’s remains, but he refused.” She alleged her ex-husband and his other son began to threaten her. She packed her son’s clothes and left. “I asked for his ID but they refused to hand it over.” Josephina said she tried to open a case at Polokwane Police Station but was told the matter needed lawyers, which she couldn’t afford. Her ex-hubby David Shoba (74) said: “I tried to talk to his mother regarding our son’s burial but she fought with me.” He said his son always wanted to live with him. “I registered all my children with my burial society and I had no challenge burying my son,” he said.
