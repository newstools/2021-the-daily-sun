COACH Dylan Kerr says he is having the best time of his life despite still not having signed a new contract with the newly named DStv Premiership outfit, Marumo Gallants. The Englishman’s short-term contract with Gallants, who were previously known as Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), has ended and it still remains to be seen if the former Baroka and Black Leopards coach will be given a new deal by club chairman Abraham Sello. Kerr is currently working at SuperSport TV as a football expert, analysing the Uefa Euro 2020 tournament. “This is an amazing experience for me,” said the former English Premiership side Leeds United defender. “This is the first time for me analysing matches on TV and I am loving it. I am working with good guys and it has been fantastic. You never stop learning in life.” When asked about his future with the Limpopo based-side which he guided to victory in the Nedbank Cup and helped them survived relegation, the 54-year-old said: “I had a meeting with the chairman last week when they were launching the club’s new name in Sandton. I think we had a good talk. Let’s wait and see what will happen in the coming days. As for now, I am enjoying the Euro tournament.” There have been reports that Sello has been talking with four-time Premiership winning coach Gavin Hunt and Dan Malesela to take over from Kerr. But a source told SunSport that Sello wants to continue with Kerr as he was impressed with his achievement last season. “They (club) want Kerr to stay, but the problem might be contract issues,” said our source. “The players enjoyed working with him last season and they also want him to stay. “But in football anything is possible and things always change.
