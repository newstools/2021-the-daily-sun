Still no sign of the Tembisa10, that's because they don't exist according to the Health Department. The department is adamant that there were no decuplets at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital. In  statement, Popo Maja of the health department said the department is disappointed on allegations made by Independent Media against the Steve Biko Academic Hospital. Maja said this comes after stories published that Ms. Gosiame Sithole has given birth to decuplets at the hospital a week ago. He emphasized that the location of the infants still hasn't been established. "We've taken these allegations made against government and healthcare professionals very seriously," he said.

Maja further stated that clinicians at both the Steve Biko Academic Hospital and Tshwane District Hospital have confirmed that there is no record of delivery of the decuplets in any of the public health facilities in Gauteng. "We invite Independent Media to assist Ms. Sithole to pursue a complaint with the Health Ombudsman for the alleged mistreatment of the patient at any health facility," said Maja. He also said the alleged “cover-up of mammoth proportions” by health authorities seems to be a journalistic error. "It cannot be that 10 or 8 babies are born and that no evidence of their whereabout or existence can be established," said Maja.
