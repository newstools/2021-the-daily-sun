FORMER Bafana “Rhoo” Bafana captain, Lucas Radebe, has urged the next generation of coaches not to limit their influence as coaches but play an integral part in society. Rhoo, as the former Leeds United captain is affectionately known, was speaking from the 8-Day Safa D-Licence coaching course as part of Betway’s nationwide community sport development programme. The former Kaizer Chiefs defender was addressing aspiring male and female coaches gathered at the Themba Sinamela Stadium. Radebe has been travelling across various Mzansi communities highlighting how coaches can extend their positive influence on people beyond the football field. “A course of this nature is designed to equip participants to become better coaches on the field of play. But what many people are not aware of, is the crucial role that a coach can play in society through displaying similar character traits that a coach has on the field of play,” said Radebe. “Our communities face a lot of challenges and a part of this is due to a serious lack of leadership and role models. “Through certain character traits acquired from being a coach such as discipline, punctuality, honesty and most importantly hard work, coaches can play an even bigger role in society that is not just limited to the field of play.” Radebe’s words hit home for aspiring coach Thobeka Simelane who has ambitions of coaching a professional women’s club in the near future. Simelane said it was important for young coaches to take the advice to heart and be more cognisant of the important role that they play in society. “I am quite encouraged by Lucas’ wise words,” said Simelane. “Our communities face several challenges and as coaches, we need to make use of our position in football to make a positive contribution to society. The character traits that he mentioned to us are not entirely new to us and this is why we need to play our part as football coaches and contribute positively to society.”
