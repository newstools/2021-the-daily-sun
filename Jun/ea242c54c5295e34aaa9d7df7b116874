MEDIA personality Tumi Moetsi has died. The talented presenter who used to work on SABC education children’s programmes, including the well-known Motsweding FM Sunday School Programme, died on Friday 4 June. Her death was confirmed by her family. “It’s with sad greatness that we announce the passing of Boitumelo Moetsi, popularly known as Mamane Tumi to Motsweding FM listeners. The families are currently engaging, and funeral arrangements will be announced in due course,” said family spokesperson Dede Letsoge. Kesegofetse Koma, who worked with Tumi on Motsweding FM, said she has left a great legacy. “I worked with Mamane Tumi when I was very young and still in primary. It has been many years working with Mamane Tumi now. I started working with her on Takalani Sesame as Zuzu. She would tell me that this character suits my voice. Working with her was a privilege because she would always motivate us. May her soul rest in peace, we will carry her legacy.” While another presenter, TJH, described her as humble. “I know Tumi Moetsi as someone who was very humble. She is one person who was always happy. You will always see that she had a vision. I will miss her and our empowering conversations.” Her colleagues from SABC Education North West were also heartbroken by her untimely death. “Tumi, your passing left us broken, in disbelief and out of words. You are one of the people who held my hand in 2014 when I joined this station as an intern. I learnt kids’ drama production from you. You never made me feel like I was an intern. Heaven has gained an angel. May your beautiful soul rest in peace!” said Mavis Modisaotsile.
