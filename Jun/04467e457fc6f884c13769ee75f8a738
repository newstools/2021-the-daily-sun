Award-winning singer and Old Mutual Amazing Voices judge Vusi Nova is looking for Africa’s next superstars from this season of the Pan-African singing competition. The show, which airs on Mzansi Magic and Mzansi Wethu, is already on the top 5 groups and the pressure is really high. Speaking to SunBuzz, Vusi said the winners this year must be able to represent Africa globally and stand out as superstars. “I don’t know if I’m being too hard or demanding, but I’m looking for superstars. There are so many talented musicians and groups, but I’m just wondering if they are superstars. “I mean we’re talking about a group that will win $100 000 and represent Africa globally. They will be the ultimate group in the continent, so they need to bring it on,” he said.

I was in season one as part of the judges who were looking for talent in South Africa. This time I’m one of the main judges and it’s a beautiful thing because I wanted it,” he said. “And when it comes to that job, I’m qualified for it because I studied music for three years and I have experience, being in the industry for long.” Vusi recently released an album titled Ngumama. “Ngumama is doing really well. I just want to thank everyone. I’m working already on another project, an album that will drop this year called As’phelelenga,” he said. “I’ll also do my first ever live DVD recording this year.”
