NORMAL church services took place at the Ebuhleni faction of the Nazareth Baptist Church on Saturday, 26 June. This was despite the Thembezinhle faction of the church, popularly known as Shembe, finally winning a court battle in the Constitutional Court on Monday, 21 June. Thembezinhle faction secretary Chancey Sibisi warned during a media briefing on Tuesday that Ebuhleni faction leader Inkosi Mduduzi “Nyazilwezulu” Shembe should stop acting like the church leader as the court had ruled against him. When the SunTeam visited the church on Saturday, Mduduzi was not present but members of the faction still recognised him as their leader. His chair, usually brought into the temple during services, was brought in as usual. Members said the presence of the chair meant he was there spiritually, even if he might not be physically. A praise singer also referred to him as the leader and the hymn that closed the service was apparently chosen by him. During the offering time, members were asked to continue contributing to the court case.
