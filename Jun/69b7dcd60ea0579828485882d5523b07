Violence against teachers is disturbing and must be condemned. The latest incident, where a parent at Phera Primary School in North West verbally and physically assaulted a female teacher, was unacceptable. Similarly, there ought to be some level of respect from pupils for teachers – more and more pupils are abusing their teachers. The disgusting scourge of pupils who assault and stab teachers must be nipped in the bud. Most incidents are perpetrated by boys and girls aged between 14 and 20. Pupils are only mimicking what they see in their communities, where problems are resolved through violence. Children see it as a way of solving problems – they see their parents being violent during protests. Communities also have a responsibility because violence in schools is a reflection of what’s happening in society. Violence against teachers must stop. All roleplayers have to take a stand and parents must discipline their kids. Theresa Mews
