THE South Gauteng High Court has on Tuesday, 15 June, sentenced former JMPD officer Bongani Silence Baloyi to 18 years imprisonment for premeditated murder and three counts of attempted murder. Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) investigated the incident that happened on the evening of 3 October 2019 where the victim, Seja Lawrence Nkwana, was travelling with three passengers in a Nissan towards Honeydew. “At the intersection of South Africa Drive and Central Africa Republic in Cosmo City, a VW Gold driven by Baloyi made a U-turn in front of the Nissan, nearly causing a collision. Both the drivers exchanged words. The accused then fired shots at the deceased,” IPID spokeswoman Ndileka Cola said in a statement. She added that the convicted officer handed himself to the cops he found along the road as he was walking away from the scene.

According to the post mortem report, Nkwana died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head, chest and abdomen,” Cola said. She said once the investigation was complete, IPID consulted the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution for a prosecutorial decision, which was granted. “IPID accepts the sentencing of Baloyi and hopes that it sends a strong message that officers of the law are not above the law. As such, they have an obligation to conduct themselves within the confines of the law at all times,” Cola added.
