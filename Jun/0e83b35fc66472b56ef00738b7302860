OFFENDERS have asked for forgiveness from their victims and those they have hurt. They did this in front of the community, prison officials and Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Ronald Lamola. The apologies were made at the Skeen Primary School in Alexandra on Thursday, 3 June, where Lamola handed over an offender project such as refurbished desks and vegetable garden. But before the handover, there was an offender and victim dialogue. Jacob Matjiu, who is still serving his sentence, shot and killed Thabo Linda in Alexandra, east of Joburg. Asked by the Linda family why he killed Thabo in cold blood, he cited self-defence. “I thought Thabo was going to use something to hurt me. I tried to remove the danger in front of me, but I unfortunately killed Mama Linda’s child. I am sorry. I hope God helps them to heal,” he said. But Jacob’s apology was not accepted. Thabo’s sister, Dikgang, said: “I will be pretending if I say I forgive you for what you did. Thabo’s kids are suffering and my mother doesn’t have much to give them.” Another offender, Dakalo Ramashamba, who has been out for two months after serving two years in prison, said he will always regret shooting and killing his “abusive” cop stepfather. This after his stepfather allegedly beat him up for taking his car and driving it around without a license. He said he tried to open a case, but was not helped as his stepfather worked at that police station. “One morning, I took his gun and shot him out of anger,” he said. Lamola said it was sometimes a challenge to reintegrate ex-offenders into communities. “It is a very difficult process. The victim/offender dialogue is emotional because society has no trust that ex-offenders can contribute positively. “These engagements help to change the perception of society,” said Lamola.
