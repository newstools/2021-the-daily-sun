KWANDA Dladla was playing when he accidentally damaged the lights of a resident’s VW Golf 1. The resident not only told his family, but also beat him up in front of them. Kwanda then ran out and his family thought he’d return later. But he never came back home. Instead, the six-year-old’s body was found in the Jukskei River in Alexandra, north of Joburg, on Wednesday, 16 June. His aunt Ntombizinhle Dladla told Daily Sun they started looking for Kwanda when he didn’t return home on the night of 9 June. They opened a missing persons case while the community continued searching for him. She said he was badly beaten when they found his body. “His face was swollen. He had bruises all over the body and he’d been stabbed in the neck. “It looks like he was kidnapped and beaten. We think the people who kidnapped him murdered him and threw his body in the river. “Maybe they didn’t want to let him go because they feared he’d point them out.” Ntombizihle said Kwanda was a sweet and smart boy.  “He was in grade 1 and loved school,” she said. Neighbours said it didn’t matter what a child did, but they didn’t deserve to die like that. “Children are naughty. They make us angry from time to time, but it doesn’t mean we should punish them to death,” said Cynthia Jomo. Another neighbour, Nomaseko Jack (38), said: “This is barbaric and the people responsible need to be dealt with.” The family asked SunReaders to help them bury Kwanda.  “We’re all unemployed. Our biggest wish is to bury him at home in Nkandla, KZN,” said Ntombizinhle. Captain Mavela Masondo said a missing persons case was opened and later changed to an inquest after the boy was found dead. He said police were still waiting for postmortem results to determine the cause of death.
