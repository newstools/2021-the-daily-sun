KIDS in Samora Machel, Cape Town, will now be able to enjoy reading books. This comes after Santa Shoebox Project donated 25 reading hubs from Kids to Kids to several pre-schools in the area on Monday, 31 May. Zolani Mahola from the Afro-fusion band Freshlyground was also part of the handover. Samantha Massey, Santa Shoebox Project project manager, said the hub has a bookcase on wheels with 40 books in various languages. “It is a full reading hub where children can enjoy reading. “We also train 25 principals on bullying as we want children to know the importance of treating each other with respect,” said Samantha.

They are excited and always ready to go to the reading corner,” she said. The centre also got training on how to read the books with the kids. “We needed the training so that our kids can get the best. “We are also grateful for the bullying training we received,” said Mirriam.
