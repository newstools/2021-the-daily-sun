GAUTENG education department’s decision to fire Parktown Boys High School principal has come back to haunt them. In December last year, Malcolm Williams was fired following the death of grade 8 pupil Enock Mpianzi after the school embarked on a botched school outing. But on Wednesday, 9 June, the Education Labour Relations Council reversed the decision and ordered the department to reinstate Williams as principal. To add to the department’s woes on the matter, the council also ordered that Williams be back paid for the six months that he hasn’t been working. Williams is expected to return to work on 1 July. “While disappointed with the outcome of the ELRC processes, the GDE has indicated that it’s studying the decision and seeking legal counsel on the matter,” read the statement from the department. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said: “We are not fully happy about the outcome of the case but also realise that this matter has been dragging for too long, negatively affecting all who are affected. In that light, we will look for advice from the experts with a view to finding a lasting resolution to the matter.” The education department in December 2020 dismissed Williams for his role in the events that led to the unfortunate death of Mpianzi at a botched school outing, which was not sanctioned by the department. “A subsequent investigation into the death of the pupil by Harris, Nupen and Molebatsi Attorneys led to Williams being charged on three counts of misconduct – two of which were upheld following the disciplinary proceedings. The two charges were for allowing the trip to take place without the GDE’s approval, while the second one related to Williams’ failure to ensure that a correct roll call was taken on the day of the incident. The last charge, related to Williams’ culpability in the death of Mpianzi.”
