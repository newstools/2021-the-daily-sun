Spider-woman and Kwaaito were spotted having the time of
their lives. Mzansi says they're enjoying seeing him this happy because
he's been stressing viewers out on SABC 1's Skeem Saam. Some are shocked because they're expecting to see him sad
since he looks so sad on Skeem saam. Clement Maosa who's known as Kwaaito has been trending on
Twitter for the storyline where he's on a journey of finding who his
father is. On the show, he appears to be very stressed and viewers have
been glued to their screens, waiting to see what will happen next. Now the star is in a hospital because of a breakdown he had
after he realised that Maputla might be his biological father. Siviwe Mdlalose said she's shocked to see Clement having
such a great time but says he should enjoy himself because Meiki is going to
terrorize them. "Spiderwoman has given him so much joy. He should enjoy
it while it lasts," said Siviwe. Emma Mokoena said she didn't think she'd see Kwaaito so
happy while he looks so depressed on screen. "I know it's just TV but every day I'm looking forward
to the next episode because I'm stressed about MaNtuli and her family,"
said Emma. Gideon Molapo said he'll forever tie characters to real
life. He said he finds it hard to separate the two. "I got so mad when  I saw this video because I've
been stressing about Kwaaito, kanti he's having the time of his life. He needs
to be stressed with us," he said. pic.twitter.com/2uzqcbdN2p
