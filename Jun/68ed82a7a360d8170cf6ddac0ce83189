A 54-year-old pastor pretended to be needing a domestic
worker and nanny for Friday, 18 June. And the evil man from Bloemspruit in Mangaung lured a woman
(32) by saying she was the right one for the job. His excuse was that
he had to attend church in Thaba Nchu, Free State on Friday. But when the unsuspecting woman showed up, the pastor never
went to the church event. Free State Hawks spokesman Captain Christopher Singo said
the pastor allegedly forced himself on the woman before his arrest on Sunday. Singo told Daily Sun: “Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime
Investigation in Bloemfontein assisted by members of 10111 arrested a
54-year-old suspect. It is alleged that on Friday, 18 June 2021, the victim was
offered domestic work and to also look after a 4-year-old boy at the house of
the suspect, who is known to be a pastor. The victim was reportedly informed by
the suspect that he will be attending a church service in Thaba Nchu during the
night and that she must look after his son on Friday. He allegedly forced
himself on the victim repeatedly raping her throughout Friday and Saturday
nights respectively. Her alleged plea to be released to go home was refused.” The victim managed to get hold of the suspect’s cellphone on
Sunday, and immediately called the South African Police Service 10111, seeking
assistance. She later escaped with the cellphone and the son of the
suspect. Meanwhile, the Hawks team were contacted to assist the
victim, which led to the arrest of the suspect at his residence in Lakeview
Bloemspruit. The police recovered a vehicle that was reported stolen at Park
Road Police Station in Bloemfontein during the arrest of the suspect. The suspect is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein
Magistrates Court on Wednesday where he will be facing charges of rape,
trafficking in person and possession of stolen motor vehicle.”
