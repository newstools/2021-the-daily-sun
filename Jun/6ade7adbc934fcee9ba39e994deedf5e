THE KZN Disaster management teams are on alert across the
province. This is because the province has been hit by a very cold
front. In areas such as Nquthu in the north of KZN, there is
snowfall which began today. Other parts are freezing cold and rain is expected. The KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional
Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka has called on residents of the province to
exercise extreme caution following the weather warning issued by the South
African Weather Service, warning of inclement weather conditions expected to
start today and continue into the weekend. MEC Hlomuka said the inclement weather conditions are expected
to bring significant snowfall over the Drakensberg Mountains and the
surrounding areas, including Kokstad and Underberg. "This could potentially lead to road closures and the
risk of motorists being stranded due to poor weather conditions," he said. MEC Hlomuka said residents must carefully plan their trips
and to keep a close eye on the weather conditions. "We are appealing to all communities in the areas that
are expected to receive significant snowfall to be vigilant and to postpone any
unnecessary trips," said Hlomuka. He said the inclement weather conditions are expected to
extend to the northern parts of the province where the risk of localised
flooding will be high as a result of the disruptive rainfall which is expected
from this morning and continues into the evening. Hlomuka also urged motorists and residents in the
uMkhanyakude, eastern Zululand and eastern King Cetshwayo districts to exercise
extreme caution, especially in low-lying areas. "Disaster management teams are on alert across the
province and will be monitoring all major routes and areas that are prone to
flooding," he said.
