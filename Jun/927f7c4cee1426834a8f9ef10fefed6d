CONTROVERSIAL former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng has vowed to take over the struggling Maluti-a-Phofung Local Municipality in the Free State. Motsoeneng was addressing mourners at the funeral service of Popy Julia Lebesana, who was a councillor at Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa and a former member of QwaQwa Bantustan parliament. He urged the community to vote for his political party ACM in the upcoming local government elections. “I am taking over Maluti-a-Phofung Local Municipality’s governance after the October elections. I will make use of my billionaire friends to invest so service delivery can run smoothly. I wouldn’t rely only on government grants. It will take me less than a year to fix water and electricity problems,” he said. ALSO READ: DALI FIGHTS FOR ACE! Motsoeneng added that he was talking from experience. “When I took charge at SABC, there was no money. I’m the only person who brought money and hired people. I know this municipality owes Eskom more than R6 billion, which won’t be a challenge for me. I was removed from the SABC because I refused to give the untouchable ANC leaders money – instead, I did business with black-owned companies,” he said. Motsoeneng confidentially told Daily Sun that he had no matric, but was capable of governing any public or private institution with integrity. “I am capable of doing far better than those who have qualifications because I am a fearless leader who believes in implementation.”
