FORMER Uganda captain Denis Onyango says now is the time for the next generation of Cranes to shine following his international retirement a few months ago. The Cranes will start the new era without the veteran goalkeeper Onyango when they face Bafana Bafana in an international friendly at Orlando Stadium today (6pm). The Mamelodi Sundowns and Uganda icon announced his retirement after his country failed to qualify for the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals next year in Cameroon. Bafana also failed to qualify for the Afcon finals. Onyango was capped 80 times after making his debut as the 19-year-old in 2005. The two nations are using the friendly as preparation for the 2022 World Cup qualifiers which begin in September. “I’m now a supporter like anyone else. But I believe it will be a good game because they are all young players (in the Uganda squad),” said Onyango. With both countries having called up inexperienced squads, Onyango expects an interesting match. “I saw Bafana called also up a lot of youngsters and Uganda is also trying to build the future of Uganda Cranes so I anticipate a good game,” Onyango said. This will be the fourth meeting between the two nations. The last time these two sides met was in the Cosafa Cup in 2019 in Durban at Princess Magogo Stadium in a 1-1 draw. Bafana won that Cosafa Plate semifinal 4-2 after a penalty shootout.
