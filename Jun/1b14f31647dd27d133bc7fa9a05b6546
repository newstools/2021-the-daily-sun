BAROKA midfielder Gerald Phiri Jnr is predicting a bright future for Bakgaga with Thoka Matsimela in charge. Baroka chairman Khurishi Mphahlele took a risk last season and trusted the inexperienced Matsimela to replace Dylan Kerr as the team’s new head coach. On his debut in the top flight, Matsimela guided the Limpopo based-side who are well known for fighting relegation to an impressive 10th place finish in the DStv Premiership. The 2018 Telkom Knockout Champions were only two points behind eighth placed Kaizer Chiefs. And now the Malawian international who joined Baroka two seasons ago from defunct Bidvest Wits is optimistic that next season they will do better compared to the last campaign. “I know Matsimela well and when it was announced that he will be the coach we told ourselves that we will work with him and make sure this team does well under him,” said Phiri Jnr from Malawi where he is looking after his truck business and enjoying time off football with his family. “I was impressed by the way he treats the whole team. It was like he has been coaching in the top flight for years. We enjoyed playing for him and we cannot wait for next season and to do better. With the support, he is getting from the chairman, management and the players I see him (Matsimela) doing well next season. He added: “We have learned a lot from last season and the aim now is to improve and make sure we challenge for trophies next season.” The 27-year-old also revealed he is pleased with the contribution he made to the team last season. “I cannot complain as the team did well,” explained the former Ajax Cape Town player. “I started slowly but I am happy with my contribution. I am disappointed we failed to finish in the top eight.”
