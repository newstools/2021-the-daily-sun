CHAMPIONS Mamelodi Sundowns are set to get their crowning moment. The Brazilians wrapped up the title a few weeks ago but have had to wait for the final day to properly celebrate their title triumph. And the day has come for the Tshwane giants to hoist the DStv Premiership trophy in the air and pour Champaign everywhere. But they still have some business to handle on the final day against Cape Town City at Loftus Versfeld Stadium (3pm). Downs, who have gone the entire season unbeaten away from home, will hope to finish strong at home. They have amassed 29 points from 14 home matches this season and will look to add to that on the final day. Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi has been pleased by his team’s exploits this season but he insists they could have done better. "The loss to Chiefs is still painful to me‚” said the demanding Mngqithi. "There were too many draws and I am not happy with that, to be honest. “I think we should have done better in the many matches that we ended up drawing. At times you are coming from a lead to draw a match‚ and that is never really good. “That’s a good record (going the season unbeaten away from home) but it could have been better‚ I think we could have done even better at home.”
