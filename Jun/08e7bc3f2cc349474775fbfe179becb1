AMAZULU’S hardworking midfielder Makhehleni Makhaula is finding it remarkable to have bounced back this season after suffering cruciate knee ligament damage last season. Makhaula, who arrived at the beginning of the season after leaving Highlands Park, has been outstanding for Usuthu this term, claiming four Man of the Match awards. His form has helped Usuthu challenge for the DStv Premiership title for the first time in their PSL era, but Mamelodi Sundowns were a step ahead as they have already been confirmed the Premiership champions. The efforts of the 31-year-old midfielder, who has made 27 appearances, have not gone unnoticed. “I had a rough time last season because I was injured a lot,” said Makhaula, whose coach Benni McCarthy has described him as a trigger man, as he can break up play effortlessly. “But I was blessed to get a contract at AmaZulu. The new technical team came in and everything changed. I’m enjoying playing under coach Benni and his technical team, and they have also shown faith in me.” Makhaula’s bad knee injury that usually takes nine months to heal, happened in Highlands’ first game of last season, the MTN8 quarter-final against Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium in August 2019. He missed 25 games in all competitions for Highlands. Some players don’t come back the same after such a bad injury but in Makhaula’s case, it’s different.
