THREE former employees of the West Rand District Municipality appeared in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday, 29 June. They appeared on charges relating to the Contravention of the Municipal Finance Management Act and the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act. The three were arrested earlier on Monday morning, 28 June, when the members of the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation Unit executed warrants of arrest in the ongoing investigation into the VBS Mutual bank looting. The suspects were granted R50 000 bail each and the case was postponed to 22 October 2021 for pre-trial preparations. Hawks spokeswoman, Colonel Katlego Mogale, said the allegations in the arrests relate to investments into VBS Mutual Bank made by municipalities. “The investments made by the municipalities into VBS are reported to have been done in contravention of the provisions of the Municipal Finance Management Act by investing municipal funds with a mutual bank. During the arrests, a search and seizure operation was also conducted in order to confiscate IT equipment which could contain pertinent documentation and/or articles relating to the investigation,” Mogale said. She said Hawks head, Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya, has previously indicated that following the arrests and court attendance of the main players in the VBS investigation, arrests within municipalities would follow. A total number of 20 municipalities deposited an amount of R3,7 billion into the bank. The amount repaid totals R2,2 billion, while the amount lost or unpaid amounts to R1,5 billion. Some of the lost funds amounting to R67 million were allegedly paid as brokerage commissions to entities and or individuals to attract more deposits mainly from municipalities. This nationwide investigation has revealed that VBS employees, municipal executives and other officials received gratifications for the investments made.
