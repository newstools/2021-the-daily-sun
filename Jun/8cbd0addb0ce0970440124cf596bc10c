VUYISEKA Tshangana thanks God and her ancestors for saving her life. She’s also grateful her punani is still intact after her ex-boyfriend tried to burn it with boiling water. The 30-year-old from Samora Machel in Cape Town told Daily Sun her ex came to her shack at about 1am on Saturday, 12 June. “I was already asleep. He knocked but I didn’t open. So he kicked the door open,” she said. He then took the boiling water Vuyiseka had put on the stove to warm up her shack as she does not have a heater. “He poured that water on me after I refused to sleep with him,” she said. Vuyiseka said she and her ex dated for two years. But he changed and would attack her whenever he was drunk. “I got a protection order because I was tired of being his punching bag. I think he wanted to kill me because we have to be in court in August. “I can’t work or do anything because the burn wounds are painful. I hope he stays in jail so he can’t hurt anyone else.” Vuyiseka urged women in abusive relationships to leave. A resident said a lot of lives would be saved if women had the courage to do what Vuyiseka did. “I am with her. Let’s leave abusive men because they end up killing us,” said the resident. Captain FC Van Wyk said an assault case was opened at Samora Machel cop shop. “A 32-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday, 14 June and is due to appear in court on Thursday, 17 June.”
