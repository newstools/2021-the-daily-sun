THE same way the youth of 1976 said enough is enough, we declare today on the 16th June, we will confront this government and protect our youth. These were the words of EFF leader Julius Malema during the 45th Soweto Uprising commemoration outside Uitsig High School in Centurion, Tshwane, on Wednesday, 16 June. The EFF chose to host the commemoration at the school after a pupil wearing EFF regalia during career day was allegedly assaulted by a security guard. He said they went to the school to protect the revolutionary against racism.  “History is repeating itself. We came here because the children of John Voster, who presided over the murder of our people in 1976, are presiding over this school,” he said. Malema urged members not to get tired of fighting for their right to education. He said young people were still being killed for free education, just like the youth of 1976. “The more things change, the more they remain the same. We should not get tired of fighting,” he said. Malema called for the ANC to prosecute apartheid government officials, or they will also be responsible for the death of Hector Pietersen and those who died in 1976. He said those who say “Happy Youth Day” were actually saying, “Happy unemployment, no water and load shedding day”. “When we say we don’t celebrate this day, we mean the youth cannot drink on this day. Youth cannot go around throwing parties on this day. It’s a day of mourning. It’s a day of remembrance,” he said.  Malema also called on members not to listen to President Cyril Ramaphosa about the coronavirus. He said they won’t comply with the nonsense he says about Covid-19 until he vaccinates people. “Let us take it to the streets. No one is going to stop us. No lockdown nonsense regulations are going to stop us. There is no nonsense that is going to stop us,” added Malema.
