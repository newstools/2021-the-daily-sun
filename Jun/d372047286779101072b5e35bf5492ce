TWO people were fatally shot and one wounded on Thursday, 10 June, after gunmen ambushed them at Zone 8 in Meqheleng, Ficksburg. According to Brigadier Motantsi Makhele, the victims were allegedly sitting around a burning tyre and warming themselves up when they were ambushed by armed men. “Three unknown men, who had their faces covered, walked into the yard and allegedly started shooting at the men around the fire. They then walked away. The three victims were later taken to Phuthuloha Hospital in Ficksburg where two died on arrival. The third was transferred to another hospital,” Makhele said in a statement.
