AFTER Mali Eningi star Big Zulu shared his video taunting King Monada for an alleged celebrity boxing match, the Limpopo star has also shared his tricks to take him on. On Tuesday, they both shared their workout videos but Big Zulu’s slow-motion video, throwing a solid jab, got social media users worried for the Idibala hitmaker. Some even said that Big Zulu’s hand alone equals Monada’s whole body and they fear that he will squash him in the boxing ring. However, some feel that the size of a person doesn’t define their strength or ability. So they feel King Monada might win the boxing match after all by using his speed.  The celebrity boxing match was first introduced by Cassper Nyovest after he spoke about the popularity of the celebrity boxing matches overseas. King Monada challenged Big Zulu, who declined, asking for someone better. At this time, no official confirmation has come from either party on whether this celebrity boxing match is actually scheduled to take place but it seems that this may be a bluff. Fans on social media have weighed in on the pros and cons of their match-up.
