TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) Football club is no more! This comes after the Limpopo-based outfit was renamed to Marumo Gallants yesterday. They also unveiled a new logo ahead of the upcoming 2021-22 season. The new name is from the clan praise of the club’s president, Ditonkana Sello. Talking at the event in Sandton, Joburg, Sello said the new name was inspired by the arduous journey the club had in their first season. Directly translated from Sepedi, Marumo means spears. “The new name of the club is inspired by the journey that has been rough outside the field, but also made us experience victory and tribute to the soldiers of our team. We are ready to fight to make this brand bigger,” said Sello. Sello bought a club in shambles from Lawrence Mulaudzi in January, who had bought the franchise of Bidvest Wits at the end of the 2019-20 season. Under Mulaudzi, the club became a mess as they were in the news almost every week for all the wrong reasons, ranging from players taking the club to court for not receiving settlements after rejecting the move from the now-defunct Wits, and protests over unpaid wages. When Sello bought the club, they were among the relegation candidates. But after taking over, he salvaged the situation and appointed Dylan Kerr, who led the club to Nedbank Cup triumph and save them from being relegated. They finished the past season sitting on position 12 in the DStv Premiership standings. Sello added: “The name Marumo Gallants is a promise to all our fans that we will fight to continue to remain in the league for all time.” The chairman also confirmed that the club would be based in Polokwane.
