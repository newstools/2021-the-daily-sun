THE Ngwelanes have been struggling to pick up the pieces and move on since their shack was destroyed by a fire in 2018. Members of the family from Eesterust, Tshwane, told Daily Sun no one knew what caused the fire but they suspected someone sent vutha. The family of 19 relies on neighbours for shelter and food. Lenah Ngwelane (32) said constantly asking for help from neighbours was frustrating. “We have a small, empty shack that has no flooring, so we can’t use it,” she said. Lenah said no one in the family was employed and everyone was depressed. “When our mkhukhu caught fire, everything was burnt to ashes but luckily, no one was inside,” she said. “We were called by our neighbours after they noticed flames. “All we want is a house where we can live happily with our kids.” Lenah’s sister, Dipuo, (37) said she felt like the whole family needed counselling. “We’re not coping. Things are getting tougher by the day and what makes it worse is our mother doesn’t live with us,” she said. “Daily Sun is our last hope. Maybe a Good Samaritan will come and rescue us from this devastating situation, so we can be reunited as a family and live happily.” Councillor Tebogo Rangoako said after the family lost everything, the community was only able to erect a one-room structure for them with the help of foreign shop owners.
