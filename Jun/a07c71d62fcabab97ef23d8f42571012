power utility Eskom will implement stage 4 load shedding from 14:00 on
Wednesday. Eskom said
stage 4 load shedding will last until 22:00 tonight. According
to Eskom, this is due to additional breakdowns of a unit at Medupi and two
units at Duvha power station. “Eskom
regrets to inform the public that stage 4 load shedding will be implemented
from 14:00 this afternoon until 22:00 tonight. This is to ration the remaining
emergency generation reserves, which have been depleted,” Eskom said in a
statement. It further
said the reserves are required to respond to further emergencies to maintain
the stability of the national grid. #PowerAlert2Loadshedding will be increased to Stage 4 from 14:00 this afternoon until 22:00 tonight, after which it will revert to Stage 2 as previously communicated@News24 @SABCNews @NewzroomAfrika @eNCA @IOL @ewnupdates @SundayTimesZA @SowetanLIVE @dailysunsa pic.twitter.com/6Q9bpiZh01
