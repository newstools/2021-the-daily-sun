Mpumalanga police have arrested a 36-year-old Hendrina police station sergeant following the murder of his wife, who was also a police officer. It is believed that he assaulted her during a heated argument and then shot her. The 30-year-old wife, a constable who was stationed at the Mzinoni police station, was shot dead in Bethal on Thursday evening. "Information at police's disposal indicates that police were notified of an incident in which a woman was assaulted and shot by her husband in town. Upon arrival at the scene, the victim was found with a gunshot wound and lying in a pool of blood, still bleeding profusely," police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said.
