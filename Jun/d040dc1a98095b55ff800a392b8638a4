IT’S all system go for Cape Town to host the 16th edition of 2023 Netball World Cup as the logo was finally unveiled in the Mother City on Tuesday. Netball South Africa President Cecilia Molokwane said the first ever World Cup in the continent will change the lives of under privileged girls in the country. Said Molokwane: “What a better way to give young girls hope that one day their dreams will come true like Phumza Maweni and Bongi Msomi. The dreams we had in the boardroom has been a reality and we want players to say in my time at this level and this is what I achieved.” Molokwane says the Spar Proteas have now set their eyes on lifting the World Cup trophy having finished the 15th edition held in Liverpool, England in fourth position. “We came forth in Liverpool, and we want to lift the trophy in 2023. Other corporate world must come to us and help turn the sport professional. Spar is not good for you, but good for netball. "Twizza Netball Club Championships have 826 clubs registered and it is a milestone for us. Twizza lives the moment and without you we will not be where we are today. As women, it’s important to stand together, it’s time to support us and we will bring the World Cup to this country.
