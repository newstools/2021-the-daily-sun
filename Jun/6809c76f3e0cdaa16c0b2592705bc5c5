DEPARTMENT of Social Development has confirmed that Gosiame Thamara Sithole, who recently gave birth to 10 kids, was found and had been a client of the department since 2016. She has been in touch with social workers who helped her with a few things. This statement came after many social media users started questioning whether the story of her giving birth was fake or not. Yesterday, the Department of Health stated that it had no record of the mother. It also stated that government had noted media reports and social media posts alleging that a South African woman had given birth to 10 babies, reportedly breaking the world record. The department said that it would be sending its social workers to assess the family’s situation. Its spokesperson Feziwe Ndwayana said the mum was at a place of safety, healing and bonding with her kids. Ndwayana further said when the family was ready, they would meet the MEC to congratulate and assist her with resources they might need. In a tweet, Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina said: “We’ve found the family and we are informed the babies are well. We will share the information with national government. I know we were a joke yesterday when government was genuinely looking for the family. Some of our local comrades have been assisting the family, so we are good.” Dear @mirriamp we’ve found the family and we are informed babies are well. Will share the information with National Gov, I know we were a joke ystday when Gov was genuinely looking for family. Some of our local comrades have been assisting this family. So we are good OK??
