KAIZER Chiefs have pretty much an idea of what to expect against Wydad Athletic this weekend. After all, it is the same Wydad team that routed them in the group stages of the very same 2020-21 Caf Champions League campaign three months ago. Amakhosi will visit Wydad at Mohamed V Stadium on Sunday, and host them in the second leg at home on 26 June. But this time they could be facing an even bigger task. According to a source in Casablanca, Wydad have identified some of Amakhosi’s key players; Samir Nukorvic, Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Bernard Parker for special attention. Nurkorvic remains the biggest attacking threat for any opposition, seen as he helped dismantle Simba in the quarter-finals. “He (Nurkovic) is seen as the biggest threat. The technical team has been studying tapes of his last few matches. Then there is the tiny midfielder (Ngcobo) with lots of energy and the captain (Parker),” said the source. “The 2010 World Cup goalkeeper (Itumeleng Khune) is also very important for the team. But they have studied their defence, which has changed quite a lot since they last met.” Wydad coach Faouzi Benzarti is under pressure to go past the semi-finals and go all the way and clinch the title, which has eluded him in the last three years. But Chiefs will not be walkovers. The stage is set for Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard to shine. The interim coaches haven’t lost a match in two outings since they took over from ex-coach Gavin Hunt, although it is a different challenge they face now. “We need to go in there wholeheartedly, with a clean mind and a fresh body and everything else will follow, in terms of our quality, techniques and dynamics. It’s exciting and happy times,” said Parker.
