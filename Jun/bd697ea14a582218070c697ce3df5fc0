KAIZER Chiefs could still qualify for the top-eight! Victory over TS Galaxy on Saturday will see Amakhosi secure their spot in the next MTN8 finals, thanks to their 3-2 win against Golden Arrows at FNB Stadium last night. Lebogang Manyama scored a rare hat-trick as Amakhosi brushed off their poor form to win only their seventh game of the season. As it is usually the case, Amakhosi rose to the occasion under the guidance of Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard to fend off a relegation play-off threat. The interim coaches lurked behind ex-head coach Gavin Hunt throughout the season and watched Amakhosi fail to score more than their opponents. But it was a different Chiefs side that turned up last night, leaving many to wonder if indeed Hunt was the problem. Michael Gumede put Arrows 1-0 up with a header from a rebound in the 22nd minute, but Chiefs nearly hit back immediately after as Willard Katsande and Leonardo Castro made a mess of an opportunity inside the box. But Katsande soon provided a top-drawer assist as he bulldozed his way into the area before crossing for Manyama to stroke home the equaliser on the half-hour mark.  Amakhosi found themselves trailing again after Eric Mathoho scored an own goal on the hour mark.  But Amakhosi did not drop their heads and certainly not Manyama, who found the equaliser yet again. He completed his hat-trick, his first for Amakhosi and only the second after Themba Zwane in the PSL this season
