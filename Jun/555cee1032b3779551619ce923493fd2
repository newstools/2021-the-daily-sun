THREE friends who mysteriously vanished on Saturday, 19 June, were found dead exactly a week later. It’s now believed Njabulo Khoza (21), Nonhlanhla Kubheka (30) and Zinhle Mkhize (33) were killed by known men they helped on the day they went missing. Their burnt bodies were found with gunshot wounds in the bushes in Babanango, KZN. All their belongings had been taken. Nonhlanhla’s Kia Picanto was found at her flat on Sunday, 20 June, with the window broken and the keys in the ignition. According to a source close to Nonhlanhla, the three had agreed to take two local men to town on the day they disappeared. “Nonhlanhla didn’t know the suspects because she’s from Pietermaritzburg. She only knew Njabulo, who knew the men,” said the source. “She didn’t suspect anything was wrong. The fact that they knew Njabulo was enough for her to trust them. Zinhle just tagged along.” When the two men were later asked about the whereabouts of the missing three, they said Nonhlanhla had left them on the road heading towards Nquthu. However, the records of the tracking company Nonhlanhla was registered with showed they didn’t take the route the men claimed. “Instead, it showed they were on a deserted gravel road leading to the bushes were their bodies were eventually found,” said the source. Nonhlanhla’s sister,, Nonjabulo, said she had moved to Nkandla to work as a data capturer at the Cwezi and Mpandleni clinics. “She had been working there since October 2020. We are sad because she was killed for having a kind heart. She offered to help criminals, who ended up killing her,” she said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the discovery of the bodies. “They were found after an intensive search was conducted,” she said. “A murder case was opened at Babanango Police Station.”
