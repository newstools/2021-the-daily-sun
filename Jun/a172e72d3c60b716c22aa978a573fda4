A CHEVROLET C8 Corvette Stingray that was split in half in a crash is being sold for parts. It is perfect if you’re a C8 owner looking for some spare parts or want to use its engine for your project car. The bronze Corvette, that is priced at about R1 million, can be seen in pictures missing its front end in what must have been a very serious crash. One of the largest pieces currently up for sale is the shell and frame, although with the front frame extensions cut off due to damage. This shell will set back willing buyers a cool R100 000.  AZ Cycle Parts is also selling the car’s 6.2-litre naturally aspirated LT2 V8 engine for R280 000.  The listing doesn’t mention how well the engine runs but does note that it has just 7 700km on the clock while the dual-clutch eight-speed transmission is also up for sale for R100 000.
