LEHLOGONOLO Machaba hopes to become the first transgender Miss South Africa. The 24-year-old contestant told Daily Sun if she won the title, she’d use it to represent the queer community and make people understand they were also human and deserved to live. Lehlogonolo from Mabopane, Tshwane, said: “We live in a country where democratic rights are for everyone. It’s about time this country includes sexuality and stops only prioritising skin colour and gender. “I hope through this platform, I’ll be able to educate people about the important things they need to know about the trans community.” The fashion graduate and model said her journey hadn’t been easy, but she had regained her self-confidence and was ready for the pageant. “I took a break from modelling in 2019 because that space wasn’t a happy one for me anymore. I had to pretend a lot was fine with me.

I spent time with my mum and brother, and that helped. I regained my self-confidence and esteem, and returned to modelling.” Lehlogonolo received her new ID on Thursday, 17 June, enabling her to enter the pageant. “Finally receiving my ID is exciting because this means I’ll no longer miss big opportunities. I couldn’t even travel. A lot of things are about to change,” she said. Lehlogonolo said she was grateful for the support she’d received from people so far.
