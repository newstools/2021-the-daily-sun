THE couple were cuddling in bed and fell asleep in each other’s arms. When a fire broke out in the one-roomed shack they were sleeping in, they didn’t hear anything until the ranging flames burnt the entire shack with them inside. Lovebirds Simphiwe Nxumalo (29) and Wendy Mhlongo (36) from KwaMashu J section, north of Durban, were found burnt next to each on Saturday, 5 May. Simphiwe’s cousin Nozipho Mthembu (35) said they were sleeping in the main house when they were awoken by people screaming that there was a fire. “We’re not sure what started the fire, but as there was no electricity at that time due to load shedding, we suspect the fire was caused by a candle,” she said. She said electricity came back on at 10pm that night “The shack started burning at about 8pm, but the neighbours helped to put it out,” she said. She said Simphiwe and his girlfriend died a painful death. Simphiwe and Wendy had only been dating for a short time and they didn’t know much about Wendy. “We just know that she’s from the area, but there isn’t much that we know about her,” she said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said KwaMashu police are investigating. “Two people aged 29 and 36 lost their lives. Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” said Mbele.
