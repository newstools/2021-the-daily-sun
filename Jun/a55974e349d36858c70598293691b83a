KAIZER Chiefs caretaker coach, Arthur Zwane, said finishing in position eight should never be celebrated by a club of Kaizer Chiefs' stature. Amakhosi sneaked into the top-eight on the final day of the DStv Premiership after defeating TS Galaxy 1-0 on Saturday. Samir Nurkovic scored the key goal for Amakhosi in the first half of the match. Zwane, who is in charge alongside Dillon Sheppard after the club terminated Gavin Hunt's contract last Friday, managed to win the last two matches of the season, beating Golden Arrows 3-2 midweek and Galaxy on the final day. Amakhosi finish what looked like the worst season for them in position eight with 36 points accumulated in 30 games. "A team of the standard of Kaizer Chiefs caliber we should not be in a situation that we are in now. We should not be happy that we qualified for top eight, but we should be happy that we are winning the league," said Zwane. He added: "We all know that we had a bad season. We could not bring in new players. We had injuries and suspensions, plus a lot of travelling in and out of the country. "In the middle of the season you could see we were battling, we dropped points we shouldn't, drew and lost some games. But some of the things happens for a reason I think this is one season that we learnt a lot." After the dismal campaign, Zwane is hoping that Amakhosi could go all the way and win the Caf Champions league not only for their fans but for the whole of South Africa. Amakhosi are in the last four of the continental showpiece. They will travel to Morocco when they have a date against Wydad Atletic on 19 May at Mohamed V Stadium (9pm SA time). Zwane said: "When it comes to positives there's a lot. We have qualified for the semi-finals of the Caf Champions League.Â  Now we are hoping that we can go through to the finals and win it for the country."
