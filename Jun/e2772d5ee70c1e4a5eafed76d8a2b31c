MEC for Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs Mmoloki Cwaile has expressed dismay at the allegations of rape of a minor by a councillor at Moses Kotane Local Municipality. The 56-year-old councillor appeared before court on Thursday, 24 June, for bail application. The councillor, whose name cannot be mentioned to protect the minor, was arrested and released on R1 000 bail for allegedly raping the 13-year-old girl. Cwaile said this was embarrassing as the incident allegedly happened a few days after Father’s Day.

They are supposed to mentor young boys to become responsible adults and teach them to be vigilant against those who abuse children and women,” he said. Cwaile said the fact that the accused was a councillor was even more disturbing. “He is supposed to uphold morals and speak against gender-based violence,” he added. He further expressed his confidence in the justice system, and called on the community to be calm and allow law enforcement agencies to do their work. The accused will appear in court again on 17 July.
