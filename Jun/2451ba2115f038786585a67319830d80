T he yanos bug has bitten singer and songwriter Nozuko “Zu” Mapoma. The talented artist, who’s the lead singer of Afro soul band Zuko Collective, has released a new amapiano EP, Ndim Netshomi Zam. Speaking to SunBuzz, she said: “The project is the final part of my Ndim series and is the brainchild of Neo of Waltz Music. It was definitely something I needed after the pain we suffered through Covid-19. “The process of creating this project was challenging for me as a vocalist and songwriter. I had to write less without losing myself. I worked on it for three months, but it was worth it and the goal was to stay true to myself while accommodating this new genre.” Speaking about why she decided to switch genres, Zu said it was a business move. “The switch was inspired by the urge to commercialise and export the sound. I realised the shortage of women in the genre. I’m all about claiming and taking up space so it’s a bonus to add to the numbers in that regard,” she said.

I know I’ll pull through,” she said. This year, the 33-year-old singer plans to cement herself as a solo artist and plans to collaborate with a lot of other major artists. She said her band, Zuko Collective, is still very much together even though she has taken the solo route. “I’ve been a solo recording artist for a few years now, but my band is still very much a part of my life and the journey. “Whether or not it has been worth going solo, it is something I will only see in the long run,” she said. Her EP is available on all digital platforms.
