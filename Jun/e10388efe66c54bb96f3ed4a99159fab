WHAT will the PSL awards be without controversy? The awards have left many questioning the judges whose decisions appear to be influenced by sentiment and not merit. The essence of the awards, by their very nature, is to recognise hard work and reward excellence and not personality. But the decision to award the Coach of the Season award to Benni McCarthy ahead of Mamelodi Sundowns’ co-coaches Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena has hardly reflected that. What McCarthy did with AmaZulu is remarkable, but not excellent. Taking lowly Usuthu, who have never dreamt of qualifying for a Caf competition, from 13th spot to second in the DStv Premiership is a stuff of dreams. To achieve that with a squad that has no more than four international players in its ranks is even admirable. But McCarthy’s larger-than-life personality should not be added to criteria used to decide who is rewarded for excellence. Granted, McCarthy took over AmaZulu midway through the season and turned their flagging fortunes around. Under Mngqithi and Mokwena, Downs only lost one match the entire season. Perhaps winning the league is no longer regarded as an achievement for Downs, given the regularity with which the Tshwane giants are winning it. The bar has become too low for them. But the coaching duo inherited a team which had achieved a treble and built on the success of their predecessor, Pitso Mosimane. Downs defended their league title… by a mile. That’s not a mean feat, considering they’ve had to battle on many fronts. The school of thought that the resources at their disposal cannot be used as a counter argument as any club in the PSL, including the big sides, are at liberty to sign any player they so wish to recruit. AmaZulu are not destitute and you can bet your last cent the new ambitious owner, Sandile Zungu, will splash cash in the transfer market. But the fact is that Usuthu are the runners-up and not the PSL winners. They are the bridesmaid and not the bride. – KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA
