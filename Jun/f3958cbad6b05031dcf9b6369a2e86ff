WARD councillor Zanele Sithole has denied claims that she has been neglecting the community of Nquthu, KZN. This as maskandi artist Bukelani “Dlubheke” Khuzwayo claimed he was helping residents as a result. “I am from Ward 1 in Nquthu where Zanele, an IFP councillor, is in charge. She was elected five years ago but has dismally failed our community,” said Dlubheke. “We need service delivery like clean water, proper health facilities and infrastructure. As it is, most pupils couldn’t go to tertiary because they do not have IDs. Their parents asked for my intervention. “I tried calling Zanele, but she hardly responded,” he said.

Dlubheke said he also tried to schedule a meeting, but to no avail. “The last time I spoke to her was two years ago and she promised to attend to our grievances. But that never happened. I now help residents with no IDs, yet that is her responsibility,” fumed Dlubheke. Former pupil Bongiwe Sibiya (18) said: “I’ve been applying for an ID since 2019 but I still haven’t received it. I tried to contact Zanele, but she never responded. “Fortunately, I was allowed to use my birth certificate for matric. But I couldn’t apply for tertiary.” Bongiwe said her dream was to become a teacher. “I asked Dlubheke to help me get my ID because he’s a public figure who can use his influence to help.” But Zanele said they had war rooms to address all issues. “Dlubheke and Bongiwe are cousins and ANCYL members, so they have nothing good to say about me. This is just a smear campaign by the opposition,” she said.
