Ihash’elimhlophe told Daily Sun the video was recently recorded. “It’s not an old video, as you can see I still look the same. However, I’ve been doing karate for more than 40 years. When I started music, I was already doing Kung Fu. The person that I’m playing with in the video is an old friend of mine. He has his dojo in Durban,” he said. “When I started, it was out of fun but it also helped me to stay focused and disciplined,” he said. A post shared by VUSIWE NGCOBO (@vusiwe_ngcobo)
