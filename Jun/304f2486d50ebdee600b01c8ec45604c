THE Gauteng government on Wednesday, 23 June, hosted its first conference on dagga  trade on a massive, legal scale. Economic Development MEC Parks Tau said the objective of the webinar was to provide a platform  for dialogue between various stakeholders. They wanted to promote black farmer participation in the dagga market,especially in Sedibeng and the West Rand. “The plan is based on strategic  goals including driving special and economic transformation, particularl y with regards to townships historically mar ginalised from the economic mainstream,” he told the People’s Paper. Tau said growth projections for the local economy were based on experiences of dagga industry counterparts in other parts of the world, many of whom were already doing brisk trade. He said: “The cannabis industry is expected to  be worth an estimated R27 billion in the next two years.” Tau said industry experts had determined that South Africa as well could unlock a billion rand-making industry! “Once cannabis has been established, it has the great potential to contribute to the local economy,” he said. Tau said the industry would help promote township SMMEs, especially  black SMMEs.
