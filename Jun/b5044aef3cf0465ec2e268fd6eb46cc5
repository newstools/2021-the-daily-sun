TLOF TLOF saga has forced two men to swap wives. Men usually boil with anger when they find out that their partners are cheating on them, but this one is different. Instead of fighting, two Ugandan men decided to exchange wives following an adultery scandal. One of them was informed that his wife was seen having sex with another man in the nearby bush. Kenyan publication Tuko reported that the other man angrily rushed to the chairman of Musoma village, Peter Balikowa, who called a meeting to resolve the matter.
