When they say the grass is always greener on the other side, do they take the weather and season into consideration? If indeed the grass is greener on the other side, it must take a considerable amount of work and effort to keep it green throughout the year. While the winter season brings with it dryness and dullness, your grass need not suffer the same fate during this time. According to My-Health-Basics website, one can keep their grass green and beautiful during winter. Here is how: 1.Apply Ryegrass Seed Generously Across the Lawn Over-seed the lawn using a rotary spreader that typically is used for applying fertilisers and bug control granules. The more, the greener. 2. Keep Seeds Moist for Two weeks to Promote Germination Once the seed is done, turn on the water. The idea is to keep the seeds moist over the 14 days. This may require watering three times per day from early morning, late afternoon and middle of the night. Be careful not to over water. 3. Fertilise Lawn to Stimulate Root Growth After the seeds germinate, apply a starter fertiliser to stimulate root growth. Choose a fertiliser that is high in potassium and phosphorus, but not necessarily nitrogen. Nitrogen is more for stimulating growth of foliage and mature grass. 4. Fertilise During Winter Season Fertilise two or three times during the winter season to give the winter grass strength. Using a greater amount of nitrogen will help top growth and keep the lawn looking green throughout winter.
