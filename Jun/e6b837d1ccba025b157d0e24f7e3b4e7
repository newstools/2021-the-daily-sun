A taxi driver, who murdered his traffic officer ex-girlfriend six months ago, has been sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for murder. The Mthatha Regional Court handed 30-year-old Thando Misani the hefty sentence for stabbing to death Ntombikayise Fayindlala on 16 December 2020. Misani entered into a plea and sentence agreement, in which he admitted to stabbing Fayindlala, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said in a statement.   Misani told the court he killed Fayindlala, 36, after she ended their two-year romantic relationship. He overpowered a lone security officer on guard at a block of flats Fayindlala was staying, before stabbing her to death.  They had previously been living together at the Tyeks Flats, in the town of Xhorha [formerly Elliotdale], but Misani moved out following the separation. ALSO READ:TWO MEN EXCHANGE WIVES!  But, on the day of the incident, a shocked Fayindlala found Misani inside her flat. She ran to the vehicle driven by a male companion, who had just dropped her off.  The NPA said Misani was subsequently chased from the property by a security guard posted at the block of flats.   Misani then returned, armed with a knife, overpowered the security guard, and fatally stabbed Fayindlala in the neck and arm before fleeing the scene. Senior State advocate Mbulelo Nyendwana told the court that crimes of jealousy between romantic partners were very serious and prevalent across the country.  The magistrate, Sizakele Sihlahla, agreed with the prosecutor, but found there were circumstantial and compelling factors to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence of life imprisonment, said the NPA.    The NPA welcomed the sentence, with the hope that it would serve as a deterrent to other would-be perpetrators of gender-based violence or femicide.
