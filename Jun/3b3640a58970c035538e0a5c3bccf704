WE often hear or see advertisements referring to some things that money cannot buy. Some call these the intangibles and priceless positions. However, that notion may seem hard to buy into after reading this article. So, how much are you willing to spend on a 4-5? No, I’m not referring to the adult entertainment world. But just what price tag can you attach to this phallic structure? Well, according to First Order Historian magazine, close to R1 million was spent on a 4-5. Meet Brit Andrew Mardle, a 44-year-old man from Manchester in England, who was born without a penis. He was born with bladder exstrophy, a condition where one’s bladder grows inside out, resulting in not having a penis. According to the publication, it took 15 operations to insert and ensure that the tubes inside Brit functioned well so he could freely go to the bathroom and relieve himself. It was also in 2012 where Brit met a urologist who would then construct what was deemed the world’s most expensive 4-5, with some skin from his right leg, some nerves and added muscles. The 4-5 was constructed and in a couple of days, ready to work. According to Brit, he could now freely have sex, but his 4-5 needed time to recover before it can get some action.
