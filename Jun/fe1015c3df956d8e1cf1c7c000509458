Lesotho coach Thabo Senong is relishing facing the land of his birth when his side clashes with South Africa at the 2021 Cosafa Cup that will be staged in Nelson Mandela Bay from July 6-18. Senong, who led the South African Under-20 side to two Fifa Under-20 World Cups in succession, is now in charge of the senior team in the Mountain Kingdom and tasked with elevating their football in the coming years. Lesotho have been strong contenders at the Cosafa Cup in recent editions, making the semifinals for three tournaments in a row, but without getting beyond that stage. They will also meet Eswatini and Botswana in the 2021 edition, with only the top team in each of the three pools and the best runner-up advancing to the semifinals. “When you look at the draw in our group, you get two types of feelings,” Senong said. “You know the first feeling is excitement that you are playing strong opposition and the second feeling is that we have to be mindful because these teams are very strong and experienced. “South Africa are the host, they are technically strong, Eswatini had a good Afcon [qualification] run, and they are physically strong. Botswana is mentally tough and tactically organised. “We are looking forward to this tournament, we are looking forward to learning, we are bringing new faces, young faces and hope that they compete and learn, but We are going to give our best to make sure that we compete. “The Cosafa Cup is a good platform for players to advertise themselves, get exposure and get scouted. For us as Lesotho, it’s a rebuilding phase, we are building the team for Chan [African Nations Championship] and the [next] Afcon qualifiers,” he said. -SuperSport
