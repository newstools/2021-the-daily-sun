People should start investing in other sources of energy rather than relying on Eskom. Winter-time load shedding is costs us a lot of money.   What’s more worrying is that it exposes us to criminals. Things keep getting worse and we’re given the same lame excuse: maintenance. Eskom has failed the nation.   Load shedding is going to be massively detrimental to South Africa’s economic growth. Urgent steps must be taken this year to bring cheap, reliable energy on the grid within the next three years. We face more load shedding this winter, and it looks as if it’s not going to end soon.   Businesses are not generating income and creating jobs. The power utility must be privatised or get competition from other sources of energy. Load shedding makes it hard for businesses to operate profitably. The power utility is turning our nation into a terrible place. ) Nelson Kgatla, Pretoria North
