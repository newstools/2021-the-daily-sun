STELLENBOSCH FC midfielder Sibusiso Mthethwa says lack of killer instinct almost got them relegated to the GladAfrica Championship. Stellies retained their PSL status by the skin of their teeth last season finishing third bottom on 29 points from 30 matches. They were two points ahead of second bottom Chippa United, who will fight for their top flight status via the GladAfrica Championship’s promotion/relegation play-offs. Only six points separated the Cape Town side from Black Leopards, who were automatically relegated. Said Mthethwa: “Football is all about winning matches and getting points. But we didn’t have that killer instinct needed to win matches in the second round. “We got chances (to score) and sometimes we over played (the ball) instead of finishing. We had a good run in the first round, but the second one was a great testing times for us. But in the end we managed to keep our status. We need to take our chances to win matches if we are to do better next season.” However, the tough as teak midfielder is positive they will do better next season to sneak into the top eight. “Our second season in the PSL was another great experience for us. There is still a lot that we need to work on as a team and personally to improve our game. “If we give our best at training day in day out surely we will win matches. Football is not about individuals, but team effort. We need to help each other to achieve our target. A top eight finish is doable and we can achieve it if we trust, believe and work for each other,” he said. Although Steve Barker’s future as Stellies coach is still uncertain, the 30-year-old player believes he’s still the right man to take the club to greater heights. “He is a good coach for us and knows how to get the best from our abilities to improve our performances,” added Mthethwa.
