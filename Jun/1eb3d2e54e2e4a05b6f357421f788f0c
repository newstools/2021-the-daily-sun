NORTH Macedonia icon Goran Pandec received a surprised and deserved guard of honour in the 2020 Eurosâ€™ last group stage match against Holland, as they went down 3-0 at Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam on Monday. Pandev, 37, is the first player in Macedonia history to score in the Euros in the group stage match which came against Austria, this game was his last for the national team. It was an emotional send-off for Macedonian captain Pandev, as he was making his 122nd and final appearance for his country. The veteran striker was given a guard of honour by his teammates when he was substituted in the 69th minute as the curtain came down on his international career at the age of 37. He retires as North Macedonia's record appearance holder, and record goalscorer, with 38 goals, almost twice as many as the next player on the list. Pandev, who now plays for the Italian side Genoa, had a fine and successful season with Inter Milan in 2009-10 season under Jose Mourinho. In that season, Inter won the league, Coppa Italia and the Uefa Champions League. On his way out in the match against the Dutch, his former teammate Wesley Sneijder at Inter when they won the treble, stood up to clap for the Macedonia veteran while sitting in the stands. ???? Igor Angelovski: "We must thank Goran Pandev for everything he has done for North Macedonia football. It has been a privilege to work for five and a half years with a man and a player who led by example and set the bar high for future generations." ??@ffmmkd | #EURO2020 pic.twitter.com/VNaL0zAOTd
