KAIZER Chiefs have confirmed the appointment of Stuart Baxter as Amakhosi coach. The former Bafana Bafana coach is back for his second spell with the Naturena based side having signed a two-year contract with an option for another two years. Baxter returns to Amakhosi to replace Gavin Hunt who was sacked in May with two league games remaining due to a string of poor results that saw Chiefs sneak into the top eight by the skin of their teeth. Baxter will work with Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard as his assistants with support from Head of Technical and Youth Development Academy Molefi Ntseki. Zwane and Sheppard will also continue coaching the reserve side. Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung is confident that Baxter will build a formidable side that will win trophies and restore the Soweto giants pride in the new PSL season. “We believe we are on track with the changes we have made so far in the coaching and technical department after a challenging season domestically,” says Motaung referring to the appointment of Baxter and Ntseki. “After extensive reviews and consultations, we decided to appoint Stuart because we believe he is one coach who understands our philosophy and culture. We know his work ethic and believe he will work with the team we have at moment while trying to rebuild and ensure we have a formidable side for the new season.” Motaung reckons Baxter will adapt quickly to the Chiefs set-up and get the best out of players he is not familiar with. Baxter will reunite with Willard Katsande and Bernard Parker who helped the club win trophies during his first stint. “It has been six years since Stuart left Chiefs after winning the league trophy in 2015. "But he departed on good terms and remains a well-liked figure by many supporters, colleagues, and some of the players he coached at the time. We believe he will be able to work within our current set up and will use the time to understand some of the players he is not familiar with.”
