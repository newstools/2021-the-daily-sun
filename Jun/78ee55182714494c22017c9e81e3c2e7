THE clock is ticking down against Caster Semenya. South Africa’s golden girl missed out again on Saturday in Regensburg, Germany, to qualify for the 5 000 metres at the Tokyo Olympics, which get underway from 23 July to 8 August. The 30-year-old, who is barred from defending her Olympic 800m title, finished fourth in Saturday’s race in a time of 15 minutes 57.12 seconds, more than 47 seconds outside the 15:10 required to compete at the Tokyo Olympics. This was not her first attempt failing to qualify for the 5 000 metres. She had previously clocked times of 15:52.28 in Pretoria, and 15:32.15 at sea level in Durban late last month. Semenya will not be allowed to run her favourite 800m race that has produced two Olympic gold medals, at London 2012 and Rio 2016. She is also not allowed to run the 400m and 1 500m due to the new World Athletics regulations, which require athletes with a high level of testosterone to lower it by taking medication. The Limpopo born star refused to take medication that would reduce her testosterone level and has twice failed in legal battles to overturn the World Athletics decision. According to the Olympics website, Semenya’s European manager (Jukka Harkonen) said before the Regensburg meet that Semenya would try again to qualify on 30 June in Belgium – although the qualifying cut-off is currently set for 29 June. Despite Semenya’s failure to qualify on Saturday, there was something to cheer about on the same night as Wayde Van Niekerk finally qualified for the Olympics. The 400m world record-holder produced a qualifying time of 44.56 seconds at a World Athletics Continental Tour event in Madrid. Saturday’s Madrid event was Wayde’s first 400m race in 2021. In the 100m race, Gift Leotlela emerged victorious when he clocked 10.15.
