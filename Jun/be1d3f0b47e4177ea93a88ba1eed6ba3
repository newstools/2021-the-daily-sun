IT’S been often described as a diamond-like structure with a tunnel in the middle that leads one to paradise. The punani’s physical structure has always drawn contentious opinions from various sectors of society. However according to Health-Line magazine, the physical structure of a punani can be identified by the labia majora (the outer lips), labia minora (inner lips) and the vaginal opening, also known as the tunnel that leads to sexual paradise. Speaking about the structure of the punani, Fast-Company.com said there are buildings that look like a punani’s structure. Here are some of them: 1. Chicago’s Crain Communications Building   Popularly referred to as The Vagina Building, this vertically slitted structure was designed by a woman to intentionally fight skyscrapers’ phallocentrism. 2. Rem Koolhaas’s CCTV building  After the new CCTV headquarters was built in China, online forums were abuzz with jokes about how it looked like a figure sitting on a toilet and it was nicknamed “The Big Underpants Building”. 3. San Francisco MoMA  This museum, by Swiss architect Mario Botta, kind of looks like a minimalist metal punani peeking out of a pile of cardboard boxes. 4. The Cathedral of Christ the Light in Oakland, California  This pudenda-like glass structure by Craig Hartman won a competition for the design of Oakland’s Cathedral of Christ the Light. The pious architect says its shape is meant to mimic that of either a Jesus fish or a Bishop’s Mitre. 5. Norman Foster’s Spaceport  Located in New Mexico’s desert, the spaceport was designed by Norman Foster for Richard Branson.
