A season that could have ended in disaster for Kaizer Chiefs has been somewhat salvaged. The Glamour Boys have managed to sneak into the top eight on the final day following a narrow 1-0 win over TS Galaxy at Mbombela Stadium. Their star striker Samir Nurkovic scored the all-important goal for the Soweto giants, earning them a spot in next seasonâ€™s MTN8. Chiefs, who have had a rather disappointing season, will be delighted with how they finished the campaign. At some point, Amakhosi had to look over their shoulder in a relegation battle. But a change in fortunes and form under the tutelage of Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard saw Chiefs turn things around. Chiefs came into the clash desperate for a win. They needed to beat the Rockets who were occupying the final top eight position and climb above them in the Premiership table. 2020/2021 PSL Matchday 30 results:TS Galaxy 0-1 Kaizer ChiefsChippa United 1-1 SuperSport UnitedGolden Arrows 0-0 Stellenbosch FCMaritzburg United 0-0 AmaZuluMamelodi Sundowns 3-0 CT CityOrlando Pirates 0-0 TTMSwallows FC 1-1 Baroka FCBlack Leopards 1-1 Bloem Celtic
