Most people think learning stops at a specific point. Some even say they’re too old to study. But they couldn’t be more wrong.

No one will push your dreams except you. So let’s find courses to study either part time or full time. Anything is possible if you put your mind to it. - Letter by Sibongumusa Tshabalala
