Swallows FC will square off with Baroka FC in the DStv Premiership match at the Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday. Kick-off is at 3pm CAT. The Beautiful Birds are hoping to end their campaign with a victory after they succumbed to a 1-0 loss to AmaZulu FC away on Wednesday. The defeat left Swallows placed sixth on the league standings and they will finish fifth if they defeat Baroka and SuperSport United drop points. Brandon Truter, the Swallows head coach, was left to rue his charges' indecisiveness against AmaZulu and he will be hoping for a better performance in their clash with Baroka. “Look, I think we had an awful first half, we weren’t here. So yeah, we weren’t our best today," Truter said. "But yet we still had moments on the counter, on the breaks in the first half. Lack of decision making, lack of final pass, of awareness, in attack, but that's been our season so far." Meanwhile, Baroka's hopes of finishing in the top eight in the league were dented after suffering a 2-1 defeat to Orlando Pirates at home on Wednesday. Bakgaga Ba Mphahlele are placed 10th on the standings - three points behind eighth-placed TS Galaxy, who will face Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. Matsimela Thoka, the Baroka head coach, says they cannot afford to lose to Swallows as they look to end their campaign with a victory. “We need to finish the season with good results. We must go play against Swallows with a good spirit," Thoka said. "So, that we get all the three points and finish the league with a win. We cannot afford to lose two games in a row." -SuperSport
