AFTER attending her mother’s graduation ceremony years ago, Livhalani Sinyosi was motivated to further her own studies. She recently graduated from Unisa with a PhD in Education. Livhalani has also excelled professionally. She’s the principal of Dzata Secondary School in Nzhelele, Vhembe, and was awarded by Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha in February for winning the African Union Continental Teachers Award for 2020. Her PhD thesis was about leadership enhancement among female principals in her district. She told Daily Sun she believed if her findings were implemented, they could create a friendlier working environment for women in leadership positions. Livhalani has been working in education for 25 years and has served as a teacher, department head, deputy principal and principal. The mother of four received the AU award for quality teaching, helping pupils achieve their long-term career goals and engaging in activities that enhance the social and cultural value of learning. On top of all her personal achievements, Dzata also produced good matric results last year under her leadership. “Education was always a passion in the family I grew up in. “My mother Gladys Shavhani was my first teacher and my role model. She was among the first women from her village to get a degree many years ago,” she said. Livhalani said when her mum retired from her job as a teacher, she had already obtained a masters degree. Livhalani has served on many academic committees and has worked at many different schools in different positions. She obtained her teachers’ diploma from Makhado College of Education in 1993 and later enrolled at Unisa to study for a degree part-time.
