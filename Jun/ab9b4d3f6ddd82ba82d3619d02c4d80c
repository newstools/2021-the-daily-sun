FIRSTLY, allow me to put forth the following disclaimer: this article does not promote infidelity! Now that we’ve cleared the air, let us look into why men need to have a lot of sex. While sex may be an act of fun, enjoyment and pleasure, it is a health issue for the male species. According to the latest health reports, men need to have plenty of it to keep healthy. This as having sex at least once a week can lower a man’s risk of heart disease by 30%. A statistical study in Wales found that having an orgasm at least three times a week may decrease the risk of a man dying from coronary heart disease by half. Close to the heart, a man that engages in regular sex can also lower his risk of suffering a stroke by 50% and diabetes by 40%. Most importantly, men who have more sex are at less risk of contracting prostate cancer. An 18-year Harvard study of nearly 30 000 health professionals determined that the risk of prostate cancer was reduced by 20% for men who ejaculated 21 times a month compared to those who ejaculated four to seven times a month. A similar Australian study found that the risk was reduced by 36% when men ejaculated seven times a week.
