BLACK Leopards have OFFICIALLY been relegated from the DStv Premiership. This after their 3-1 loss at the hands of Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium yesterday. A brace from substitute Abdul Ajagun and a goal from Fagrie Lakay saw the Citizens put the final nail in Lidoda Duvha’s coffin. Isaac Masia’s early strike for Leopards was not enough to inspire the Limpopo side to what would have been a crucial win in their battle for survival. In the end, their fate was sealed with one game to spare. They can now no longer be able to move away from the bottom of the table and drop to the GladAfrica Championship next season. They have been the most likely candidates to suffer automatic relegation all season having spent the better part of the campaign rooted to the foot of the table. But they seemed to be clawing their way out in recent weeks with impressive wins over Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and Kaizer Chiefs. But eventually it was not enough. They did not learn their lesson from last season where they finished 15th and had to save their top flight status through the play-offs. On the other hand, it was a winning return for Eric Tinkler in his first match back as the Citizens coach. The former Maritzburg United and SuperSport United mentor is back for his second spell with the side from the Mother City. He is looking to solidify the Citizens top eight spot before he begins fresh at the start of next season. Tinkler’ side, who are in seventh place on the log, will look to finish the campaign strong against champions Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. Leopards will play their final top-flight match against Bloemfontein Celtic at Thohoyandou Stadium on the same day, 3pm.
