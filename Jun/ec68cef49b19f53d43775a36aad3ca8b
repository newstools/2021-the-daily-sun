Kaizer Chiefs have exercised the one-year option on the contracts of star forwards Khama Billiat and Lebogang Manyama. SunSport has reliably learned that the duo will be staying at Naturena this coming season. Both players’ contracts were due to expire on Wednesday. Chiefs are under immense pressure to have the players’ futures sorted out as they have the Caf Champions League final to play against Egyptian giants Al Ahly on 17 July in Morocco. Chiefs found themselves in a difficult position after reaching the Champions League final as 11 players - Bernard Parker, Itumeleng Khune, Manyama, Billiat, Kgotso Moleko, Philani Zulu, Ramahlwe Mphahlele, Willard Katsande, Eric Mathoho, Bruce Bvuma and Brylon Petersen - are out of contract with the Soweto giants. According to our source, Chiefs have also offered Zulu a one-month contract until the end of July and the club has done the same with club captain Parker. Chiefs’ communications manager Vina Maphosa said the club’s focus right now is on the Champions League final and any update will be communicated to the media. “We will let you know. For now, we are focused on the final. I can assure you that we’ll have a full squad for the final,” Maphosa said.
