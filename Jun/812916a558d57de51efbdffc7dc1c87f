SWALLOWS FC coach Brandon Truter reckons their second season in the PSL will be tougher. Truter guided the Birds to finish the DStv Premiership in sixth position last season. The Dube Birds were also called draw kings for earning 20 draws in 30 matches. Swallows had an incredible home record as they were unbeaten in all matches and lost only twice away. “The first season was an eye opener with the quality of football, opposition, the professionalism was also of high quality. “The league challenged us a lot and we managed to grow. We started like a house on fire, raised expectations. But to finish sixth doesn’t look like a setback for a newly promoted team. I mean two loses away and unbeaten at home shows we had a good season.” The former Richards Bay mentor said they also missed the backing of their fans when the going gets tough in the big league. The fans are still not allowed at match venues due to Covid-19 pandemic. “We miss our fans who bring a different atmosphere at stadiums. Without them it’s not easy, but we need to be mindful of the third wave, stay home and be safe. We must follow all the protocols.” Truter has already identified areas that need to be strengthened as he anticipate a tough season ahead. “Teams always struggle during their second season. We need to strengthen the team and fill gaps that are there. We definitely need to beef up in midfield, with the strikers scoring and defenders working tirelessly, we need to add stability in the middle of the park,” he said. Truter has also made plans to replace players who might leave the club to search for greener pastures such as striker Ruzaigh Gamildien, Sifiso Hlanti and Kgaogelo Sekhota, having reported to have joined Kaizer Chiefs. Gamildien was a stand-out performer for the Birds in the first round, having scored 11 goals to finish last season with five goals behind the league’s top scorer Bradley Grobler of SuperSport United. “We will replace those who will leave the club,” added Truter.
