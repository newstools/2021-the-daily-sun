THEY went to steal from a house. As they were busy ransacking the house, a cellphone fell from the pocket of one of four suspects. And it was that cellphone number which helped cops to bust them on Saturday. Captain Solomon Sibiya said the family was asleep at their house in Sinqobile near Kagiso, Mpgale City when they heard a knock on the door and the suspects demanded cash. “The suspects then tried to open the window but failed. They kicked the door open to gain entry. “Once they had entered the house, they pointed a firearm at the family, still demanding cash.” The suspects ransacked the house and took the family’s TV set, two cellphones and two pairs of All Star takkies. They fled the scene in a silver Toyota Tazz with an unknown registration number, leaving a cellphone belonging to one of them behind. The family went to open a case at Kagiso Police Station and where a house robbery was registered. Police launched an investigation and a search for the suspects in a silver grey Toyota Tazz. “Consistent and intelligence-driven intensive investigations led to the successful apprehension of the suspects,” said Captain Sibiya. Kagiso station commander Brigadier Themba Maduna has applauded the members for their hard work and commitment throughout the investigation. Police investigations will further determine if the suspects are linked to similar cases that were reported in other areas. The four suspects, aged between 28 and 38, will appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court soon facing charges of house robbery.
