ZULU prime minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he’s happy the battle for the Zulu throne happened during democratic times and that there was no bloodshed. Speaking during a media briefing held at KwaKhangelamankengane in Nongoma, KZN yesterday, Buthelezi revealed that the battle was far from over as late King Goodwill Zwelithini’s first son was challenging King Misuzulu’s right to the throne. Buthelezi said it was not the first time there was a heated battle for the throne. He pointed out that King Shaka was killed by his brothers, Prince Dingane and Mhlangane. He said as respondents in the court challenge for the crown, Zwelithini’s first wife Queen Sibongile Dlamini and her daughter were required by the Pietermaritzburg High Court to file their responses by 30 June.   “King Misuzulu, Prince Tshelendoda and I met the lawyers on Wednesday, 23 June, to prepare our responding affidavits. “Through this process, we’ve seen the contents of the other affidavits, including those of Princess Thembi and others. In those affidavits, King Misuzulu is consistently referred to as prince,” he said. Buthelezi said the affidavits implied that Prince Simakade Zulu was the rightful heir to the throne. He said he stopped King Misuzulu from meeting Princess Nombuso, the daughter of the late king’s first wive, to smoke the peace pipe on Wednesday. “As the matter is sub judice, the law prevents such meetings from taking place,” said Buthelezi.
