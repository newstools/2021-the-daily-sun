THE Palm Ridge Specialised Crimes Court postponed the Eskom Kusile R745 million fraud case to 20 July. This was to allow former Eskom contracts manager France Hlakudi to consult his new attorney after his previous one withdrew. Hlakudi and his co-accused, who are former Eskom group executive for group capital division Abram Masango, businessman Maphoko Kgomoeswana, CEO of Tubular Construction Antonio Trindade face charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. Investigating Directorate spokeswoman Sindisiwe Seboka said the allegations stem from their various roles in defrauding Eskomâ€™s Kusile Power Station in Mpumalanga between 2014 and 2017. She said the NPA Investigating Directorate is in the process of extraditing Michael Lomas, a former Tubular Holdings executive advisor, who is living abroad. Meanwhile, the Investigating Directorate received a forfeiture freezing order of R1,4 billion against the accused.
