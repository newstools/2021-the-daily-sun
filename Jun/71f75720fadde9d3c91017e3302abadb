A MAN was shot for allegedly chasing and threatening to stab people. Marikana police said on Saturday morning, 26 June, they were called to a Marikana shopping centre where a man bought two knives from one of the grocery stores and threatened to stab security guards, but was chased away. Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the man, who was reported to be mentally challenged, went to another grocery store where he chased guards out of the store and threatened to stab them. “One of the security officers was apparently firing shots while running away, but that did not deter the man from chasing them. The man ultimately stabbed one of the guards in the chest and he succumbed to his injuries on the scene,” said Mokgwabone. It is alleged that the other guard fired several shots leading to the death of the man. A cop from Marikana was also in the area when the suspect chased people and threatened to stab them and was armed with his service pistol, and also fired several shots. “In the process, a man and his son were struck by stray bullets. The man (58) died on the scene while his son (39) sustained injuries on the leg. The son was taken to Job Shimankane Tabane Hospital for medical treatment.” Three cases of murder and one of attempted murder have been opened and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate has taken over the investigation.
