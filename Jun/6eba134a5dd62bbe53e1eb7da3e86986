TT said people can expect to see a lot of changes on the show. “We have got a new member on the team who will be leading the whole construction team. She’s a very talented and wise lady. I chose her because I am all about women empowerment and uplifting others. The format of the show is going to change a bit, but the essence of the show is still going to be there.” TT said the show is still going to be based in Gauteng. “We are still in the middle of the pandemic and we don’t want to put people’s lives at risk by travelling the whole country. But another factor is that the show is a sponsor-based show and we’re on a budget. Our budget still doesn’t allow us to branch out to other provinces but hopefully when the show gets renewed for season three, we will visit other provinces,” he said. The businessman said that in the first week of next month, they will release a promo of how people can apply and nominate people for the show. The dates of the season premiere will be announced soon.
