JOBURG Metro police have launched an investigation after two officers allegedly harassed a street hawker on Sunday last week, 20 June. This comes after video clips made the rounds on social media showing the cops confiscating stock from the hawker, who tearfully pleaded with them. In the footage, the woman can be heard pleading with the cops not to take the stock, saying she’d get in trouble with her bosses. “I beg you. I’m unemployed. Please don’t take my things. “I have six children. I don’t work. I have no job,” the woman pleaded with the cops. With the high levels of unemployment that we are facing, we should not be penalizing entrepreneurs. We should be finding ways to support them and to grow their businesses. This is not the way, there is no empathy whatsoever pic.twitter.com/bF07pMvf1y The clips were captured by a man identified as Tony Oliveira de Sousa, who took to social media to vent out his frustrations. He alleged the cops wanted a bribe which the woman couldn’t afford.

Meanwhile, Joburg Metro cops spokesman Xolani Fihla said an investigation was under way. “It’s further alleged by the complainant that the officers tried to solicit a bribe from the vendor for selling goods on the side of the road without permission to do so. “The matter has been brought forward to the JMPD internal affairs unit and a preliminary investigation has been initiated,” said Fihla.
