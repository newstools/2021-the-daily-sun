BAROKA FC coach Thoka Matsimela does not think it will be the right decision for his young star, Evidence “Tower” Makgopa, to leave Bakgakga for bigger DStv Premiership clubs at this point. The 2020/21 Premiership Young Player of the Season made a name for himself when he scored a brace in Bafana Bafana’s 3-2 win against Uganda in the international friendly a fortnight ago. It was the 21-year-old’s debut for the national team following a great run in the league campaign. Makgopa had a fine season for Bakgakga, scoring seven goals for the term. His good form has now attracted interest from big teams such as Orlando Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs. “I think it is still early for Makgopa to leave us now and join the so-called big teams or go to Europe,” said Matsimela. “I think he still needs two more seasons to grow up. Makgopa has been coming along right since he was promoted to the first team two seasons ago. If he joins those big teams now, I think he will struggle to make it straight to the first eleven as the big teams rely on big names. But that’s just my opinion. Makgopa is a good striker and I am not surprised teams are after him.” Matsimela even made reference to their former strikers Gift Motupa and Thabiso Kutumela, who left the Limpopo-based outfit when they were still developing and struggled at Pirates. “But look at Kutumela now at Maritzburg United, he is doing fine and I think now he can go and shine at any team. The same happened to Motupa, but when he came back to us on loan from Pirates, he did well.” It remains to be seen if Baroka chairman Khurishi Mphahlele will be tempted to sell his star if big clubs come knocking with big money.
