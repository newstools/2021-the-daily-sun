THE second magosha (39) has died in hospital following the accident where nine prostitutes were hit by a bakkie last weekend. The incident, which occurred in Caleb Motshabi in Mangaung, saw the first magosha dying at the scene after a Toyota Hilux bakkie ploughed into them. Daily Sun published the story on 9 June. A 40-year-old magosha died while the injured eight were rushed to hospital on 4 June. One surviving magosha, who wished to remain anonymous, said to Daily Sun: “I was sitting down with eight other magoshas when the accident happened. It was still quite and no one had scored a client yet. We saw a bakkie speeding towards our direction. It hit all of us, and I watched my friend taking her last breath at the scene while we were waiting for ambulances.” She sustained leg injuries and was discharged the following day. “This shows how dangerous this job can be. But I have two kids that I need to feed and I am unemployed,” she said. The incident made residents so angry that they wanted to attack the driver after the crash. But a patrolling police van happened to be at the right place at the right time, and cops managed to rescue the driver. The driver (48) told the cops that he fell asleep behind the wheel while driving back home to Matlharantlheng in Mangaung. He was arrested and charged with culpable homicide. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo confirmed the second death. “One victim remains in hospital while all six women were discharged,” Mbambo added. Road accident fund spokesman Sello Mosotho said the victims can approach RAF offices for assistance. “The families of the deceased can also claim, even if the deceased were not South African citizens.”
