INDIAN weddings are always a huge festivity. And what’s a good wedding without a little bit of drama? According to TMZ.com, a bride collapsed and died of a heart attack at her wedding ceremony, but this did not stop the wedding. The groom went on to marry her sister instead. The bride, only identified as Surbhi, was reported dead at the scene. It is reported that once she died, both the families of the bride and groom came up with a solution for Mangesh Kumar to marry her sister, Nisha. Surbhi’s dead body was then placed in another room in order for the wedding festivities to continue. Nisha and Surbhi’s brother Saurabh said: “It was a bizarre situation as the wedding of my younger sister took place while the dead body of my other sister was in another room.”
