ACTRESS Mona Monyane has been through hell and back. She lost her newborn daughter in 2017, her home to a fire in 2019 and separated from her husband, actor Khulu Skenjane, last year. Mona said the events that unfolded in her life led to a deep depression. “I was depressed and lost myself for a long time. But I’m now reclaiming my life. God has restored me and I’m whole again.” She said she decided to move to Cape Town to start over. “I’m now in the Mother City and I’m here to start businesses outside of acting. For a long time I thought I wasn’t enough because of what I’ve been through. I lost a home, a daughter and a marriage, I’ve been through hell and back.” She said she has now found her purpose and looks forward to rebuilding her life. “I’m a new person. I found God and I’m happy with where I am. My pain has made me realise there’s more to life.” ALSO READ: ZOLA 7 NOT DOWN AND OUT!

There’s no bad blood between us. ” Mona said she wanted to speak to women about the power of healing. “Women have been inboxing me, sharing their pain and that’s why I share my struggles publicly to give other women who’ve gone through the same pain some hope,” she said.
