JUDGMENT in the bail application of Simon “Scorpion” Ndyalvane has been postponed. Ndyalvane, along with two other cops, Voster Netshiongolo and Caylene Whiteboy, were arrested in connection with the murder of Nataniel Julies (16) in August. Both Ndyalvane and Whiteboy were denied bail at the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto, while Netshiongolo was granted R10 000 bail on his second bail hearing attempt. However, Ndyalvane reapplied for bail based on new evidence. On Thursday, 17 June the South Gauteng High Court postponed his bail judgment to next month. Ndyalvane and Whiteboy face charges of premeditated murder, possession of illegal ammunition and defeating the ends of justice, while Netshiongolo is charged with accessory after the fact and defeating the ends of justice. Nataniel, who had Down Syndrome, was shot a few metres away from his home in Eldorado Park, south of Joburg and later died in Chris Baragwanath Hospital. His death sparked outrage in the community and led to residents protesting outside the Eldorado Police Station. They accused the police station of trying to cover up the murder. During their initial bail applications, which were denied, Whiteboy said Ndyalvane instructed her to pull the trigger and promised to pay her legal fees if she lied before the law. She said she was framed and didn’t know that the gun given to her had live ammunition. Netshiongolo told the court he was off sick on the day of Nataniel’s shooting, but he was instructed by Ndyalvane to go to the crime scene and tamper with evidence.
