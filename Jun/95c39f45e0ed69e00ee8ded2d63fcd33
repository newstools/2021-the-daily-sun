NOMHLE Mazwi lives on top of the world in her two-storey mkhukhu, which even has a balcony. The 49-year-old from Philippi, Cape Town, told Daily Sun that at night, she had a great view of the kasi and she sat on her balcony with her husband on weekends to get some fresh air. Nomhle said they decided to build a second storey in 2015 because their shack was too small. But they didn’t have the space to make it bigger. “It was the best decision because now I have an awesome view and more space. It gives me peace of mind that even if my mother wants to visit, she has somewhere to sleep,” she said. Her husband Oscar Antonio (51) built the second storey by himself, and it took more than two years. Nomhle said she had been living in the area for more than 20 years and was still waiting for a house. “We were using our shack as a kitchen, sitting room and bedroom. As our son grew up, we couldn’t continue sleeping in the same space as him.” Oscar told the SunTeam that it cost him more than R7 000 to buy the building materials, but he saved on labour by doing everything himself. “I had the plan in my head, so I didn’t want someone else building it for me. They weren’t going to do it the way I wanted it. It’s still a work in progress as I still want to make the interior look better,” he said. Nomhle and Oscar slept upstairs while their 20-year-old son slept on the ground floor. She said she loved looking at the rooftops of other houses from her bedroom. “When the weather is hot, it’s always cool upstairs. But in the winter I need more blankets. “They say the higher you go, the cooler it becomes,” she added. Resident Lindiwe Sodinga (53) said she admired Nomhle’s mkhukhu. “They made their shack so it looks like a proper home,” she said.
