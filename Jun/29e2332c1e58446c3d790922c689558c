I don’t understand why pornography doesn’t get the criticism unfairly apportioned to a few errant pastors by the media. I guess the reason can only be that many people support this unsavoury, satanic business. In my opinion, the porn industry in general, or media content of a sexual nature in particular, destroys lives and turns men and women into lustful beasts. I have no doubt in my mind that the prevalence of pornographic images in the mainstream media – coupled with graphically violent content – is the reason behind brutal rapes, assaults and killings. What was once considered wrong and immoral in the eyes of God-fearing man is increasingly becoming right, so long as latest research and the law allow it. No words can begin to explain pornography’s evil objectification of women. It destroy relations between men and women, finish and klaar. Evidently, nudity and sex are marketing and profiteering tools. And chances are that many upright people watch porn in secret. Be that as it may, its destructive nature is undeniable. - Letter by Khotso K.D Moleko Mangaung, Bloemfontein
