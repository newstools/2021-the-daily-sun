A JEALOUS
wife waited for her husband to fall asleep before she did the unthinkable. She took a
pair of scissors and chopped off his penis. She later drove him, and the
remains of the penis, to hospital where doctors in Vietnam battled for hours to
reattach the manhood. According
to The Daily Star, Dr Nguyen Thanh Tuan and his team were asked to reconnect
the recovered portion of the penis. Dr Tuan
said there were many difficulties to overcome with the operation, especially on
the part of the penis where the blood supply had been absent for around seven
hours. “The penis
is cut with scissors, so the doctor has to treat the wound and wash the severed
part thoroughly to avoid infection,” said Dr Tuan. “This
operation requires the use of special microsurgery glasses and the surgeon must
be trained in microsurgery, vascular surgery.” It’s
understood police were investigating the incident, which reportedly happened
because the wife was jealous of her husband’s popularity with other women.
