WHEN she was young, Sarinah Mukwevho was bullied and she isolated herself. She struggled to form close bonds with other people so she turned to writing. The 26-year-old from Masia Vhangani Village, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, started writing her feelings down to feel less alone. This is how her debut poetry book, With All My Colours, was born. She started writing it in 2015 and published it recently. Sarinah told Daily Sun whenever she felt happy, sad, angry, numb, in love, empty or successful, she would write about it. Afterwards, she’d feel a sense of relief. “My poems are real, heartfelt and speak directly to life’s truths. My voice celebrates both female and male, eliminating socially constructed gender inequalities and other stereotypes,” she said. Sarinah said poetry was everything to her and gave her a voice. “When I cannot utter a single word, poetry voices my views and heartfelt feelings,” she said. Sarinah said through writing, she was able to overcome being bullied. She said her greatest inspiration had always been nature. “I love how William Shakespeare and Maya Angelou play around with words. “I love how their words challenge my own intelligence and how much their words allow me to tap into my own imagination.” Sarinah said she wanted to share all the colours of her emotions with the world as she was not the only one with these colours. She said even men would enjoy her poetry as they were appreciated and shown love through it.
