ANGRY community members protested yesterday to reclaim their kasi from thugs. Residents of Orchards and Chantelle marched to the Tshwane municipal offices to hand over a memorandum of demands. They said criminals terrorised them and broke into their houses. They complained that there was low police visibility in the area. Chris Mboweni said the marchers wanted to make the authorities aware their community had no protection. He said thugs prowled the streets day and night looking for residents to attack. There was a total disregard for the law and very few people followed lockdown regulations, especially the curfew. He said criminals snatched cellphones from kids and targeted joggers. “The community is under siege and we’re saying enough is enough. We want action now,” he said. Esther Thipe said most house breakings happen during the day when people are at work. “She said many of the thugs were people who first came to the area looking for jobs,” said Esther. “When they can’t find jobs they help themselves to our belongings in our houses. Police take their time to respond when we call them to come and assist us.” The residents said they were giving the municipality 14 working days to respond to their grievances. Among their demands were 24/7 police visibility, that Metro police must enforce by-laws, and that the provincial police commissioner should come to the area to address them. Community safety MMC Karen Meyer accepted the memorandum and promised to respond by Friday, 18 June.
