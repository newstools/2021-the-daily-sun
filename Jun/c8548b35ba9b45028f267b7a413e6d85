SEVEN people were killed in a shootout with police this afternoon (Tuesday) in Scottville in Pietermaritzburg in the KZN midlands. This was revealed by KZN police spokeswoman, Colonel Thembeka Mbele. Mbele said, the scene was still active, among the deceased was one of the 31 awaiting trial prisoners who made headlines when they escaped in April this year. These prisoners escaped when gunmen forced the prisoner to transport vehicles off the road. They were being transported from New Prison to the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court. "Police are still busy at the scene. At the moment what we can confirm is that among the deceased is one of those prisoners that escaped in April. What we are not sure of yet if whether there are more escapees among the deceased or not because police are still busy," said Mbele. She also revealed that among the deceased were two women. "It is not clear what were they doing inside the house or they were part of the gang that has been tormenting the residents in Pietermaritzburg or not," said Mbele. She added that police have found a total of six guns inside the house. She said, when police stormed the house they had been acting on information from intelligence, the thugs which were troubling residents with serious crimes since January this year have been hiding inside this house.  "When they approached the house the occupants started shooting in the direction of the police and that's when the shooting ensued, resulting in seven being killed," said Mbele.  She added that from January this year residents have been faced with a serious crimes like rape, murder and robbery.
