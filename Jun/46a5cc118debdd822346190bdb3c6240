PUBLIC Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says government has found a strategic equity partner in a bid to save the embattled South African Airways (SAA). On Friday, Gordhan confirmed that cabinet agreed for government to own 49% while Takatso Consortium held 51% of SAA. The groundbreaking venture came after the state-owned airline was placed under business rescue in December 2019, a process that concluded this April. According to Gordhan, the objective had always been to restructure SAA to ensure that it was viable, agile, competitive and not reliant on the state’s coffers. He said Takatso Consortium comprised of Harith General Partners, a leading investor in African infrastructure and airports. Meanwhile, airline management firm Global Airways was selected as the preferred strategic equity partner for SAA. “This is a demonstration of South Africa’s ability to develop an entirely home-grown solution to successfully relaunch SAA as a sustainable, competitive and transformed airline. This airline is not dependent on the fiscus,” Gordhan said. As part of the relaunch, Gordhan said the finances of the operations of the airline would be provided solely by the consortium, which would provide about R3 billion during the initial stages. Gordhan believed the public-private partnership would reposition SAA in the domestic market, continent and beyond. “It will give us an opportunity to augment SAA with technical, financial and operation expertise.” SAA will contribute its brand, landing slots, route licences, lounges and loyalty programme into the partnership.
