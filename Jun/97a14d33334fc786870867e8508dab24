THREE ANC members accused of assaulting five fellow party members briefly appeared in the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court on Thursday, 24 June. The matter was postponed until 9 July for further investigation. The three, aged between 29 and 40, were not asked to plead to charges of assaulting fellow ANC branch comrades Leonard Nkoana (41), Sizile Ndubane (47), Themba Ndubane (47), Marvelous Maaboi (34) and Thabang Nkoana (28) by hitting them with pick handles and knobkerries. The incident allegedly happened at Word of Life Church Hall in Shatale, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, during the ANC branch’s annual general meeting on 7 June at about 3pm. The attack left them with stitches. Leonard Nkoana and Sizile Ndubane told the SunTeam the nomination proces was disrupted by angry comrades who arrived in two Toyota Quantums and six vans.

They disrupted the meeting and attacked the delegates inside the church hall. “They bashed me with the pick handles and knobkerries and I collapsed and fainted on the ground. I woke up in hospital, where other comrades were being admitted as well, bleeding profusely. We want to see justice taking course.” Ndubane said: “We were trying to rescue comrade Nkoana from the angry comrades who were attacking him. But in the blink of an eye I heard a stone hit me in the head and I became dizzy and bled. They then turned to Themba and assaulted him before attacking others with the pick handles.” The party’s acting chairman in the province, Mandla Ndlovu: “It’s in the best interests of us all to focus on the ANC internal process.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that three suspects aged between 29 and 40 were arrested for assault. They were granted R2 000 bail each.
