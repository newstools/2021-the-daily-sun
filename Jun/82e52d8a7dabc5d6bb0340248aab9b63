CONVICTED murderer Viwe Rulumeni (23) will spend 20 years behind bars for murdering his former lover, Asithandile “Kwasa” Zozo. Rulumeni pleaded guilty to strangling and stabbing the Wits University student to death on 17 August 2020. He committed the murder in full view of a number of people, including Zozo’s younger siblings. In his plea explanation, according to NPA spokesman Luxolo Tyali, Rulumeni admitted Zozo, who was then 19, had ended their romantic relationship and he didn’t want to accept that. On the day of the incident, he went to Zozo’s home in Dutywa because she was ignoring his calls and SMSes. “He forcibly took Zozo to an open field, where he stabbed her several times until the knife he was using broke,” said Tyali. After killing Zozo, Rulumeni took a poisonous substance in an attempt to commit suicide and was taken to hospital, where he recovered. In a pre-sentence report, prepared by a social worker, Rulumeni claimed he was abandoned when he was younger. The report revealed he was motivated by jealousy when he committed the offence because Zozo had progressed to university, while his life seemed to have stagnated after passing matric. Prosecutor Advocate Bakhe Mtukushe submitted the victim impact statement prepared by court preparation manager, Sindisiwe Buthelezi. The statement explained the trauma Zozo’s father and siblings had suffered following her murder. The prosecutor also led the evidence of Zozo’s mother and that of her cousin, who attended the same university as her. Welcoming the sentence, Eastern Cape director of public prosecutions in the Mthatha region Barry Madolo applauded the investigation and prosecution team for the short turnaround time in finalising the case.
