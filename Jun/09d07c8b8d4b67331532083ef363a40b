AMAZULU coach Benni McCarthy has taken a swipe at the doubting Thomas’ who said he was an overrated coach following his sacking at Cape Town City. McCarthy said they are now eating humble pie, as the former Bafana striker has led Usuthu to their highest ever finish (second) in the PSL. This was after the Durban-based side beat Swallows 1-0 at home in the penultimate DStv Premiership fixture on Wednesday to cement the runners up place. This achievement has seen AmaZulu qualify for next year’s Caf Champions League, which will be the first time the club will be playing in Caf’s premier club competition. “We’ve achieved the unthinkable. When I joined the president (Sandile Zungu) said ‘I want the top four finish’ and people said he was crazy,” said McCarthy. “And people said I was overrated as I was fired from Cape Town City and I was going to fail, and that I’m not a good coach. I wonder who is laughing now.” The former Orlando Pirates striker praised his team for this “fantastic” achievement. “I’m extremely excited and happy for the players. They have been fantastic throughout this season,” said McCarthy who also saw his side go for a record of 16 league games unbeaten. When McCarthy was appointed Usuthu coach on 14 December, AmaZulu were lying 12th with six points after seven games. His appointment came two months after Zungu bought the club and revealed that his intention this season was to finish in the top four. However, when McCarthy was unveiled, he said he would fight to win the league title. Usuthu did put up a fight for the league title against recently crowned champions Mamelodi Sundowns. McCarthy helped the club win the Q3-Innovation last month. The Bafana legend, who has been nominated for the Coach of the Season award, has also claimed the last two Coach of the Month gongs. AmaZulu conclude their season against struggling Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow (3pm).
