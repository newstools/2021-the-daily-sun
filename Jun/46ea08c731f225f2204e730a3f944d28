FOUR suspects were killed and four others injured in a shoot-out with police in President Park in Midrand, Joburg, on Friday, 25 June. National police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said the incident took place during an intelligence-driven operation. He said a multidisciplinary team, comprising members from SAPS crime intelligence, Joburg flying squad, Gauteng highway patrol, EMPD specialised task team and JMPD K9, swooped in on the suspects who were allegedly planning to hijack a truck between Pretoria and Joburg. Naidoo said when the team entered the premises, they were met with gunfire by some of the suspects, who were armed with rifles and handguns. “There were 27 suspects on the premises. Four suspects were shot and killed while four others were wounded. A total of 23 suspects, including those who were wounded, are under arrest,” he said.
