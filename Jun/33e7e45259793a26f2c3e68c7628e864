KAIZER Chiefs' newly appointed coach Stuart Baxter has sent a sincere apology, AGAIN, for his remarks at his previous club in India. The new Amakhosi coach was sacked by Indian outfit, Odisha FC, after making incendiary comments during a post-match interview. "Given the unfortunate night of my exit in India, and my unfortunate comments and to be very honest, stupid comments that I made," said the 67-year-old Baxter. "I felt strongly that I needed to make another apology before recommencing my work in South Africa. Anything that I said that offended anybody, I humbly apologise. I know it is the highness crime. It looked like I was making lights off. I was not. That was absolutely not my intention, that does not reflect me as a person. I do know that many people were upset, and for that, I am truly sorry. He concluded: "In the future there will not be an issue with me making such clumsy, stupid comments I really hope that anyone that was offended by my words will accept this heartfelt apology. Thank You." Baxter rejoined Amakhosi on a two-year contract, plus a two-year option. This will be his second spell at Amakhosi following his first stint, which was a success during 2012 to 2015, where he won several trophies with Amakhosi, including two league titles in 2012-13 and 2014-15, the Nedbank Cup in 2012/13 and MTN8 during the 2014-15 season.
