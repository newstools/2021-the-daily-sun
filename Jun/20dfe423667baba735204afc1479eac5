IN 2017, Ndivhuho Nemutandani had a dream that he was a master of the arts. The 24-year-old sculptor from Tshisahulu, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, is fast becoming a household name in the province. Ndivhuho said while in high school, he’d collapse and doctors couldn’t heal him. He’d also have dreams where he made fascinating creations. “When I didn’t finish school in 2017 due to illnesses, I thought my future was gone,” he said. “But I didn’t realise that my ancestors had other plans. “I’m healed since I started to follow my dreams.  “I now make any form of art that comes in my dreams.” He said he didn’t get any formal training. “The dreams I had are becoming a reality and paying off as I am able to pay my bills,” he said. “I’m also grateful for the support from my community.” His first creation was a sculpture of a dog. He also draws house plans and does water features.
