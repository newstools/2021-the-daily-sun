MATHEMATICALLY, Chippa United have retained their DStv Premiership status with one game to spare. Chippa are currently leading the three teams promotion/relegation playoffs with seven points after three matches. Richards Bay are in the second spot with four points, and whatever happens in their last match against Royal AM on Monday afternoon at Umhlathuze Sports Complex (3pm). With Royal having pulled a no show in their past two playoff matches, today's game is improbable to happen. However, whatever happens, will not harm Chilli Boyz, who will play their last match against Royal on Wednesday in Gqeberha. Rich Boyz can only finish with seven points, and they will still be one goal adrift of Chippa, who beat them 2-1 in the first playoffs match. Richards Bay coach Allan Freese was roped in by the club just before the playoffs said conceding a goal against Chippa on Saturday killed their top-flight dream. Freese said: "I think the team did well in the games that we played. However, we let ourselves down by conceding against Chippa. It is disappointing for these players but they will have to be strong." Freese, who promoted Highlands Park to the top flight via playoffs in 2015, also stated that preparing with no knowledge if they will play or their opponent will not show up or not also affected players mentally. "This whole thing has been unfair to players and it affected them. Midweek we prepared but we never played. Again tomorrow, we do not know if we will play or not," said Freese. Royal boycotted both their matches in the playoffs as they believe it should be Sekhukhune United participating in the three teams mini-league, not them.The whole drama emerged after the Limpopo based Sekhukhune were awarded three points and declared as GladAfrica Championship winners in an arbitration, upheld in the high court.
