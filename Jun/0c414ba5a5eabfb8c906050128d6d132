JAPAN and Washington Spirit striker Kumi Yokoyama has come out as a transgender man! The 28-year-old  was part of the Japan team that was eliminated in the last-16 at the 2019 Fifa Women's World Cup held in France. Yokoyama revealed on Youtube channel and was encouraged to tell their story after living in the United States. "When my girlfriend said there was no reason for me to stay closeted, it really hit me," Yokoyama said per ESPN. "Coming out wasn't something I was enthusiastic about, but if I think about my life going forward, it would be harder to live closeted, so I found the courage to come out." "In Japan, I would always be asked if I had a boyfriend, but here (in the United States), I am asked if I have a boyfriend or girlfriend. Yokoyama also touched briefly about they love life. They stated: "I have dated several women over the years, but I had to stay closeted in Japan. Yokoyama is prepared to have more surgery when their playing career is over, having had some at 20. They also revealed that Rebecca Quinn, who is playing for OL Reign and the Canada women's national team, impacted their decision after seeing the Canadian wearing a "Protect Trans Kids" sweater before a game last year.
