FORMER Idols SA contestant Sneziey has set the record straight after she posted a photo wearing isiphandla that left many fans confused. After she posted the photo of the traditional animal skin wristband, many thought she is now a sangoma and other thought she has abandoned Christianity. The singer, who’s real name is Sinenhlanhla Msomi, said she loves Jesus and she’s still a Christian. “I’m not a sangoma and I’m not going through any initiation process. I’m a Christian and I love Jesus but I am also a child at the Msomi residence,” said Sneziey.

So my respect goes far as not questioning their culture. I don’t see why I should question their culture and the way they do things,” she said. The singer said her family was planning a traditional ceremony for her. “I’m not going to deny that because I am their child and that doesn’t make me less of a Christian. Even the Bible says we should respect our elders. That shouldn’t only apply in church, but also to our parents at home,” said the singer. A post shared by Snenhlanhla Msomi (@snezieymsomi)
