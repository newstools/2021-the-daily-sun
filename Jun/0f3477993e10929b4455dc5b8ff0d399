SHE was in labour and went to the clinic to give birth. But nurses at Mapela Clinic, outside Mokopane in Limpopo, allegedly turned her away. They told Helen Kekae they couldn’t help as there was no electricity following load shedding that hit the area. She was referred to George Masebe Hospital. But the 25-year-old didn’t make it to the hospital and gave birth in a neighbour’s car, which her family had hired to take her to the clinic. Helen was helped by her aunt to give birth, and although her two-week-old baby boy is in good health, she’s traumatised. Her family is demanding answers from the Limpopo health department and wants compensation for the trauma caused. Helen’s sister, Junior Mabusela (40), told Daily Sun they had a document Helen signed at the clinic, confirming she’d give birth there. “The nurses turned my sister away even though they saw she had labour pains. They didn’t even check how far the baby was,” said Junior. “They were supposed to call an ambulance. At least she’d have been helped by professionals even if she’d given birth in an ambulance. “It’s by the grace of God that we didn’t lose the baby. My aunt isn’t trained to help people give birth,” she said. Junior said no social workers were sent to speak to Helen or to check on her. “She’s still traumatised. We want the department to compensate her,” she said. Limpopo health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said nurses tried to connect with ambulance services but couldn’t due to network failure caused by load shedding. They advised the person transporting the family to drive to a nearby hospital. “This is an unfortunate incident. However, we’d like to advise pregnant women not to wait until it’s late,” he said. “The probability is that she could’ve given birth in the vehicle if the ambulance was called and delayed.”
