THE City of Joburg mayoral committee visited Orlando West, Dube and Mofolo in Soweto on Sunday, 20 June, to ensure shops complied with the law. The committee was accompanied by the Joburg Metro Police Department. The department’s spokesman, Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun the focus was on by-law compliance. He said they did site inspections at shops and interacted with street vendors near the Dube Train Station. “All the service entities were encouraged to fix potholes, improve road markings, address illegal dumping, unblock sewer pipes, cut overgrown grass and repair broken street lights,” he said. Minnaar said public safety educators, the Metro police’s Community Outreach Unit Officers and EMS PIER engaged with the Ezimbuzini Informal Settlement community through the distribution of pamphlets and encouraged compliance with the Disaster Management Act. He said the programme ended at Mofolo old Age Home, where MMC for Public Safety Mally Mokeona told the elderly they were loved and appreciated. “You are respected. That’s the reason you’ve been blessed with a long life in this world,” said Mokoena. Street vendors promised to comply with by-laws. They pleaded with the mayoral committee to ensure services were delivered. “We’d like to see our cities cleaner, which means taking care of bust or blocked sewerage pipes,” said Mathapelo Mokone (41). Another resident, Lilly Mabena (39), said she was concerned about illegal dumping.
