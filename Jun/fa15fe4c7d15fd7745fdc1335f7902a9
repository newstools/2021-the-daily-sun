CHIPPA United midfielder Kurt Lentjies is confident that his side can pull off the great escape from the relegation zone. The Chilli Boys are one of the three contenders for automatic relegation to the GladAfrica Championship heading into the last two matches. Chippa along with Black Leopards and Stellenbosch are in danger of having the dreaded relegation axe fall on them. But Lentjies remains positive that the Gqeberha side can still climb up the ladder and away from danger. They face Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in a must-win match at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday (5pm). “It’s do or die for both teams,” said Lentjies. “The only plan is to get the three points. We know our situation. We have two cup finals coming up. But we are focused on TTM first, we need to win that match at all cost. “It’s not the time to look at personal performances, it’s about the team. I have always been the type of person who puts the team first. I just try to be influential in the team.” Chilli Boys boss Siviwe “Chippa” Mpengesi has had to fire three coaches this season as his side’s struggles continue. Lentjies insists that the players are fully focused on the job at hand, determined to turn things around. “The mood is good in the camp,” added Lentjies. “We had a couple of days to work with the coach so we understand his philosophy and how he wants us to play but the performance is not too important now, all that matters is the result.”
