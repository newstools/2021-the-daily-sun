MAMELODI Sundowns left-back Aubrey Modiba says his first season with the Tshwane giants didn’t go as well as he wanted, but he is hopeful that things will be better in the next term. Modiba joined Sundowns from SuperSport United at the beginning of the season, but he couldn’t get things going from the word go, as Lyle Lakay was a preferred left back. Lakay, who has been with Sundowns since 2018, was the first choice as he is not only strong going forward, but he is also deadly from set plays. But when things finally got going in Modiba’s favour later in the season, he helped Sundowns to retain the league title. The 25-year-old was on the scoresheet when Sundowns thumped his former club SuperSport 3-1 on 26 May at Loftus Stadium to win the league with three games to spare. “It was ups and downs and I had to think about my game so that I can be able to compete because that is what it is at Sundowns,” said Modiba. “Personally, I’d say it was up and down but hopefully next season it will be better. I know I’ll be prepared and ready to work again.” In all, Modiba featured in 30 games across all competitions for the Tshwane giants, with a return of one goal and four assists. It is not bad for a player who many thought would struggle to get the playing time with the star-studded side like Sundowns. Modiba said it was always his lifelong dream to win the most coveted trophy locally. “It was always my dream to win the league,” he said. “To achieve that with one of the biggest teams in the PSL and also on the continent, it was a great feeling. Hopefully there will be many more to come and hopefully we can do well and win another one this coming season.” Sundowns will open the 2021-21 season with a mouth-watering clash against Kaizer Chiefs in the MTN8 quarter-final in Pretoria in August.
