SDUDLA On Point wants to help women and girls who struggle with their weight walk with their heads held high. The non-profit organisation was started by Tsholofelo Magashoa and Messy Sedime two years ago. The aim was to educate and raise awareness about obesity. In February, they introduced a mentoring programme where five girls were adopted by the organisation and took part hikes. “I’m based in Makgwabetlwane, outside Tshwane, while Messy is in Protea, Soweto. The aim of the organisation is to help empower both young and old women who struggle with weight to face society. Every year, we organise different events such as beauty contests and pool parties. This year, we started a mentoring programme called Confident Plus Girls,” she said. Earlier last month, the group invited girls and community members for a 10km hike followed by discussions. Palesa Cindi, one of the five girls in the programme, said: “I wouldn’t be a finalist at Miss Varsity Plus Size 2021 if it wasn’t for them.” Boitumelo Lwate said she went on the hike because it felt good to surround herself with people with positive outlooks. Thuli Ngobese (32), who joined the group in 2019, said she enjoyed every moment she spent with other members. “As a mentor, I teach people self-love, encourage them to follow a healthy lifestyle and eating properly. I also encourage them to surround themselves with positive people,” she said.
