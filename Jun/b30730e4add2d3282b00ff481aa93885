AFTER relying on izinyoka for five years, the people of Mangaung squatter camp finally have electricity. Nosiviwe Nogqala (45) from the settlement in Philippi East, Cape Town, said they’d been paying R300 just for maintenance of the illegal cables. “We were paying for a person to fix our cables, which got damaged at least once a month,” she said. Nosiviwe said they were also losing money because their appliances were constantly getting damaged. “The problem with connecting illegally is that our appliances were damaged every time we had problems with the cables,” she said. Vuyokazi Stimela (34) said they were charged a lot of money for electricity. “The people connecting it were asking for a lot. We couldn’t complain because we wanted power.” Vuyokazi said now that she has a legal power connection, she knows she’s getting what she paid for. “At least now we’ll only stress about buying electricity. We won’t get stressed about other people and won’t misuse the electricity,” she said. MMC for energy Phindile Maxiti thanked Mangaung residents for being patient while the project was undergoing completion. He said: “About R4,5 million was spent to connect households to the electricity grid. We’re immensely proud of the work done to connect these families to the grid. “As a result of this partnership with Eskom, more than 371 households now have electricity for the first time.” Maxiti said the municipality was pleased the electrification project was providing the community with a better quality of life and business prospects. “We remind residents to help the city protect infrastructure by reporting electricity theft, vandalism and illegal connections to the city or the police,” said Maxiti.
