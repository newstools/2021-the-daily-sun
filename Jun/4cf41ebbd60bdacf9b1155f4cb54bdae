He said motorists of oncoming traffic were also in danger should a victim of this crime swerve too quickly to avoid the spike, or swerve after impact. “The safety of Gauteng road users is already at great risk with the absence of the Gauteng traffic police monitoring the highways during the night. “The DA has already demanded, and will continue demanding, MEC Mazibuko declare the Gauteng traffic police an essential service to ensure a 24-hour monitoring of Gauteng roads, Shackleton added.
