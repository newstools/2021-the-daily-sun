An angry married woman has labelled her husband as selfish and insensitive. This comes after the husband wouldn’t allow her to go visit an ex-boyfriend for a week before his wedding day to help with the arrangements. The woman posted on social media and said: “I left my ex-boyfriend to marry my husband because my ex wasn’t ready. Now my ex-boyfriend is about to wed and he begged me to come and assist him with wedding plans. “I planned spending just a week at his place. I told my husband because I don’t like hiding things from my husband, but my husband refused,” she said. She said the same ex that allowed him to marry her is asking for their help and support, but the husband refused and forbid her from attending the wedding. The SunTeam asked readers on Facebook about the situation and Khusta Maqoko said: “Her husband must go for counselling, kuzoshuba endlini. Someone is going to be denied his conjugal rights.” Sherlock Sithole Wa Bapela said: “Let us cut each other’s losses. You can go to your ex-boyfriend and keep him because I won’t get married to someone who is still attached to her ex.” Richard Malebo Mokoena said: “Whether he agrees or not, ok’salayo it shows that this lady can’t be trusted. She’s going to cheat on him if she wants to be with that ex.” Prince-kay Thobejane said: “She visits or doesn’t visit the ex, the wedding is off just for saying she wants to visit her ex.” Nosani Maweni said: “A week? Is she going there to try and change his mind? As the ex, she shouldn’t even attend his wedding, let alone visiting him for an entire week.” Shockwave Anderson said: “I’m not very good at stopping people from going where their hearts are, but once she leaves my house to spend time with an ex-boyfriend, she must not come back because... eish... Die poppe sal dans.”
