THE case of two farmers and five farmworkers linked to the murder of two cousins has been postponed to Thursday for a bail application. The accused, from Dirkiesdorp outside Piet Retief in Mpumalanga, appeared in the magistrates court on Monday, 31 May following their arrest on 28 May. Werner Potgieter (48), Cornelius Greyling (25), Zenzele Yende (49), Elliot Dlamini (60), Moses Dlamini (58), Mzwakhe Dlamini (49) and Sikhumbuzo Zikalala (25) are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice. The incident happened near Pampoenkraal Farm in August 2020. Sfiso Thwala (40), Musa Nene and Christopher Thwala were travelling towards Driefontein when they had a puncture. While changing the tyre, they were approached by two bakkies carrying passengers in the back. The drivers allegedly started questioning and accusing them of stealing sheep. The victims were taken to the farm, tied with cable ties, pepper-sprayed, assaulted and shocked. Sfiso and Musa died there and then. Potgieter, Greyling and Yende were also linked to the murder of the Coka brothers, which sparked outrage in April. They were arrested, given R10 000 bail each, and arrested again on Friday. Farm Residents, Workers and Labour Tenants Association leader Bongani Hlatshwayo said the community was happy with the arrests. “This is a victory for us. We pray that they don’t get bail. We want to see justice,” he said. He said the community would continue supporting families of the victims.
