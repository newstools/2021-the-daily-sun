Communities must change the attitude or culture of burning public property. This must come to an end! I detest the way people destroy municipal buildings or traffic lights. Burning public property in protest is your loss. It’s idiotic of people to burn and destroy property, especially in their own communities. People see government properties not as theirs, and this must change. We need to start treating things as our own. Maybe we won’t go on a rampage and destroy things that are important to us. This culture of damaging things during protests has to change. I don’t advocate for the burning down and destruction of public infrastructure, or disruption of schooling. We need to change the way we protest because there are other ways. Why do South Africans always have to behave like lawless thugs when we’re unhappy about something? Whether it’s service delivery, salary increases, sanitation or housing, this is often the behaviour during protests. There’s no justification for burning public property, which is there to serve communities. We just don’t want to see libraries, robots, clinics and police stations being destroyed, period.
