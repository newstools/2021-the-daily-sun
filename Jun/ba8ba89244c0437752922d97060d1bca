DSTV Premiership club AmaZulu are hard at work in beefing up the squad ahead of next season. Usuthu, who will participate in either the CAF Champions League or Confederation Cup, have signed Maritzburg United left-back Mxolisi Kunene. Kunene will arrive as a free agent after deciding to leave Maritzburg, as his contract with the Midlands club will expire on Wednesday. “Yes, AmaZulu have signed Mxolisi Kunene from Maritzburg United,” said an insider. Kunene will take the place of Sibusiso Mabiliso, who will officially be leaving Usuthu for Kaizer Chiefs. Mabiliso didn’t renew his contract with Usuthu, leaving the Durban-based side’s management scrambling and looking around to get a new left-back. Kunene, who joined Maritzburg at the beginning of 2017-18 season from Baroka FC, will fight it out for the left-back position with veteran defender Tsepo Masilela, whose contract was recently renewed by Usuthu. However, Kunene’s fitness and big match temperament will be tested as he didn’t play a single match for Maritzburg last season. He suffered a bad knee injury against Black Leopards when the 2019-20 season was being completed in the bio-bubble in Gauteng last August. He never recovered from that to play, but was back to full training with Maritzburg before this past season ended. However, Maritzburg chairman Farook Kadodia was keen to hang on to Kunene but told SunSport that he will not stop the player if he has found a better offer elsewhere. “He’s a free agent at the moment and he’s weighing up his options but I have engaged in negotiations with him,” said Kadodia. “But I don’t want to be selfish, if he gets a better deal elsewhere, I won’t stop him from that.” Kunene will become the second player AmaZulu have signed from Maritzburg United. They have also snapped up Keagan Buchanan.
