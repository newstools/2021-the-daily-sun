THE Hawks’ South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau are on the hunt for Ahmad Isa (41) for his alleged involvement in a R400 million drug bust on the N1 highway in Tshwane earlier this month. Niel Pieter van Zyl (39) is already behind bars. But the Hawks are still searching for Isa, who evaded arrest when three people linked to the R400 million drug bust were arrested in Cape Town last week. Hawks spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Philani Nkwalase said a warrant of arrest was issued against Isa on 9 June. He’s allegedly linked to a drug syndicate operating in South Africa, stockpiling large quantities of cocaine, and exporting it to other countries. The suspect is also wanted on an Interpol Red Notice issued in Antwerp, Belgium, on charges of dealing in cocaine and money laundering.

His three accomplices – Rafiek Baderoen (44), Rashied Baderoen (48) and Michael Norman (38) – were escorted to Tshwane from Cape Town under heavy police guard last Friday. They’re expected to appear alongside Van Zyl in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Monday, 21 June. “Any information regarding the whereabouts of the suspect can be reported to investigating officer Warrant Officer Brittion on 082 778 2815, or the section head of Saneb Brigadier Naicker on 082 778 2818,” he said.
