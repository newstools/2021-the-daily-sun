IF you’ve had the pleasure of watching a cricket match on TV, you’d have noticed how before any match starts a full and comprehensive review of the cricket pitch is done for its batting and bowling condition. You’ll often hear how dry, slow or quick the pitch is and how much grass it has on it. So, whether you’re at The Wanderers, SuperSport Park or Newlands Cricket Ground, all playing surfaces are not the same. The same can be said about punanis. Many sex experts agree that not all of them are the same. They differ in shape, size and appearance and, according to Mind, Body and Green magazine, there are nine different types of punanis. We take a closer look at the five prominent ones: 1. Curved outer lips Some outer lips will have a curved magnet-like shape, meeting at the bottom. This shape will create a window in the middle, revealing the inner lips. 2. Prominent inner lips This is when the inner lips are larger than the outer lips, and it’s a relatively common type of vulva. Some people may experience discomfort using tampons, having sex, or wearing tight clothing when their inner lips are prominent. ALSO READ: JUST HOW LONG SHOULD SEX LAST? 3. Long, dangling inner lips This is one way prominent inner lips might appear, wherein the inner lips are longer than the outer lips and seem to dangle from the vulva. These inner lips can be an inch long or longer, or they may look like there’s extra skin or folds. 4. Small, open lips With this type of vulva, the outer lips are still small, but they’re set farther apart, making them appear slightly open. 5. Visible inner lips For this type of vulva, the outer lips appear curved or pulled outward, leaving almost a window for the inner lips to peek through.
