HE developed an interest in comedy while studying IT at Vaal University of Technology. And what started out as just warming up the crowd is now a job for Skholo Mayisa. He told Daily Sun he even quit his job earlier this year to focus on comedy. The 37-year-old from Sharpeville in the Vaal said after he quit his job as a network engineer, he focused on comedy. He did it under the mentorship of comedian Kedibone Mulaudzi, who is the founder of South African Comedy Academy. He has been part of comedy shows such as Soweto Comedy Festival Vaal Tour, Tshwane Comedy Nights, Just Nje Comedy Nights and Comedy Under the Sun. “It’s been an awesome journey. I have also done a few international gigs in neighbouring countries such as Botswana and Lesotho,” he said. Skholo hosts Vaal Comedy Nights every last Thursday of the month. This week he hosted a comedy night at Capello in Sedibeng. “It was the first time hosting Cappello comedy night, which was a brilliant show with Zicco Sithole. “Unfortunately our main act, Mashabela, couldn’t make it so Salesman stood in for him with other supporting acts. But the turnout was very good,” he said.
