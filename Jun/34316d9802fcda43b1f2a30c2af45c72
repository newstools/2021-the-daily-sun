CHIPPA United have agreed with TS Galaxy that striker Augustine Chidi Kwem will remain with the Chilli Boys until the promotion/relegation play-offs are concluded. Last month, Galaxy chairman Tim Sukazi confirmed they signed Kwem on a two-year deal with a one-year option to renew, and the player was due to join the club at the beginning of next season. But with Chippa to contest the play-offs after they finished 15th in the DStv Premiership, both parties have agreed the Nigerian striker will remain at Chippa until the play-offs are over. Sukazi was excited to have acquired the services of the Nigerian, as his side were goal shy in their maiden Premiership season scoring 26 goals in 30 matches and conceding 31. The Mpumalanga club missed out on a top eight finish after they were beaten 1-0 by Kaizer Chiefs in the final game of the season on Saturday. Amakhosi edged Galaxy into eighth place on a better goal difference. The 23-year-old, who joined Chippa at the beginning of last season, scored 13 goals in 59 appearances for the Chilli Boys. “We believe Kwem is a striker who could add value to our current strike force that has done a sterling job for our club so far. “We thought it wise to conclude the move now rather than later to allow the necessary paperwork to be finalised as early as possible before the start of the new season,” said Sukazi. Kwem will be the Rockets’ second signing. They have completed the signing of Sinethemba Mngomezulu from Uthongathi FC. Kwem helped the Chilli Boys to reach the Nedbank Cup final this season, but the Eastern Cape club lost 1-0 to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the final last month.
