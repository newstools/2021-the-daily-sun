BAFANA Bafana assistant coach Janevski Cedomir has tested positive for Covid-19. This means the Yugoslavia mentor who was appointed by head coach Hugo Broos will not be on the bench when Bafana Bafana host Uganda in a friendly match on Thursday at Orlando Stadium (6pm). Second assistant coach Helman Mkhalele will be incharge of the team as coach Broos is not in the country due to receiving the Covid-19 vaccine in Belgium. SA Football Association confirmed the news on Wednesday in a brief statement. "As per Covid-19 requirements and protocol, Bafana Bafana team conducted the second Covid-19 tests on Tuesday for the entire team ahead of the match against Uganda," said the statement. "Unfortunately, Assistant coach Janevski Cedomir tested positive while the rest of the team is negative. As is the norm, all team members – players and support staff – are tested ahead of entering into camp and all results were negative. However, during the second round of tests conducted on Tuesday, 8 June 2021, Assistant coach Cedomir tested positive." Team doctor Tshepo Moloi said they will continue manage the situation and follow the protocols. Moloi stated: "We continue to check for clinical symptoms and encourage the staff to wear masks without failure, practice social distance and everyone is accommodated separately."
