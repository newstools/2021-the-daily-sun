IF YOU you’re a plumber, then you understand that there are different types of pipes – from cast iron and steel to plastic and copper. All these pipes serve a specific purpose: ensuring that no leaks ever occur. Much like these pipes, the 4-5 serves a similar purpose and comes in different shapes and sizes. According to Healthline magazine, there are 20 different types of penises but we will zone in on the five prominent types: 1. The curved upward Like the banana, this 4-5 type curves slightly upward when it’s erect. The upward curve means an advantage when it comes to stimulating all the right spots for toe-curling and full-body orgasms. 2. The curved downward When you tilt that banana around, you find this shape. It’s basically a penis with a slight downward curve. Again, the curve is noticeable only during an erection.

Sex positions that allow you to work the curve toward the front wall of the punani or rectum give you the same hotspot advantage as those with banana shapes. 4. The straight-line 4-5 This type maintains pretty much the same shape – from shaft to head. According sexologists, this 4-5 needs one to be extra creative with sex positions because of its lack of flexibility. 5. Bigger base with a narrow head This penis is thicker at the base and narrows as you get closer to the head, giving it a cone-like shape. The narrower head makes for easier entry, and a wider base provides more stimulation the deeper you go.
