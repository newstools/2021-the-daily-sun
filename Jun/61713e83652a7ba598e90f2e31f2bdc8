Award-winning fashion designer Thebe Magugu has developed a fabric that kills viruses that land on its surface. According to the talented designer, the compatibility of the fabric was tested using the coronavirus. Speaking to Daily Sun, Thebe said fabric was inspired by his desire to explore “unseen forces of protection”. “I tend to live in fear but what always overrides is the protection I know I have from my ancestors and my late grandmother Matiego Magugu,” he said. “I wanted to provide that same feeling of protection by creating a garment that promotes health and well-being.” The luxury fashion designer whose garments and designs have been worn by international stars such as Issa Rae and Beyonce explained how the fabric was made. He said: “The yarn for the fabric was coated with anti-virus before being woven.” “The Fabric was produced in collaboration with Hinterveld SA + Svenmill SA and it’s proven to be effective against virus and bacteria for up to 30 washes. During the yarn testing, it was concluded that the anti-viral coat eradicated 99% of viral particles.” ALSO READ |  WATCH: ‘COOKING WITH SOMIZI WAS A WASTE!’ The Kimberly-born designer said the fabric has been in development for about three months. “It was a challenging process because I wanted the fabric to be entirely produced in South Africa and it took a collaborative effort from the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Gauteng to produce the final look,” he said. Thebe who was selected for the LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) Prize back in 2019 said he is humbled by all that he has achieved in his career as a designer. “I’ve truly been humbled by all I’ve achieved and having some of my wildest dreams come true has been surreal. I’m really focused on the idea that my dreams should no longer include me alone, growing the brand and standing in my light,” he said. He said his next collection might be made from the fabric that he developed. A post shared by Thebe Magugu (@thebemagugu)
