BAROKA FC captain Elvis Chipezeze has vowed to fight to regain his number spot next season. Last season was a tough one for the Zimbabwean international as he struggled for game time. The 31-year-old only played nine times and conceded 14 goals. As a result, he lost his No-1 spot to Oscarine Masuluke. “It has not been a good season for me but the good thing is that the team did well,” said Chipezeze from home in Zimbabwe where he is enjoying some time off with family and friends. “I would have loved to play more but Oscarine was doing well and I had to support him. I am a good friends with Oscarine and we help each other all the time at training and during the games. But next season I’m aiming to work hard so that I can play more. I am ready for the challenge next season.” Since he joined the Ga-Mphahlele-based outfit from his home country’s side Chicken Inn in 2018, Chipezeze has been number one goalie for Baroka. In 2018, Chipezeze helped Baroka lift the Telkom Knockout Cup. But the return of Masuluke has seen Baroka coach Thoka Matsimela benching Chipezeze. Last season, Masuluke played 21 matches and conceded 22 goals. In 2018, Baroka chairman Khurishi Mphahlele sacked Masuluke, together with then coach Kgoloko Thobejane and Olaleng Shaku for drinking while on duty in the team bus following their 2-0 defeat to Free State Stars. But Mphahlele and Masuluke smoked a peace pipe and the 2017 Fifa Puskas Award finalist was allowed back to the team with a three-year contract. Thobejane is also back at Baroka working with the development team.
