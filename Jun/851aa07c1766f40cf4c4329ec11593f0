LEGENDARY comedian and TV personality Augustine Shotholo’s ball continues to roll in different aspects. And it’s because of the efforts he always puts on every project he touches. Affectionately known as Kwetepane Wa Motokwa, the man who has come back to radio as Tsa Borena co-host on Thobela FM has released a single titled Madonoro produced by Katlego “Tempo De Kreator” Monegi and Nare “Illmatic Tha Saint” Seema. According to Augustine, the song is taken from Tempo’s fourth album titled Sounds Of Mirriam, which is a tribute to his late mother. He told SunBuzz that the song speaks against women and children abuse, which the country continues to face daily. “I’m one of those men who are concerned about the ongoing abuse that women and children continue to face. I believe this song will help spread the message across the country. “We’ve seen on television and and read in newspapers how women and children are being terrorised by their partners and fathers. It’s crucial that we stand together as men and fight this challenge because if we don’t, many lives will be lost,” Augustine said. ALSO READ |  IZINKABI ALLEGEDLY AFTER ENCA NEWS ANCHOR!
