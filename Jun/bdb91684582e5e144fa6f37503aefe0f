CHURCHES want the new marriage bill to protect women and children. North West church leaders met on Tuesday, 22 June, to give their input on proposed changes to marriage laws ahead of 30 June, the closing date for submission of comments. Mahikeng Ministers Fellowship chairman senior pastor, Moss Tlalang said: “The engagement has helped church leaders become aware of the challenges that lie ahead.” The pastor said the meeting followed a provincial consultative engagement held on Saturday, 19 June, to deal with proposed legislation, which will allow women to have more than one husband among other things. Tlalang said women who entered into customary marriages should be given the right to opt out if their husbands wanted to take more wives at a later stage. “A consent requirement in customary marriages would safeguard the interests of those in marriages arranged by families or by the community,” he said. “We have also identified the need to deepen our understanding of customary marriages and civil unions. Most couples enter into both without understanding the ramifications.” Tlalang said as church leaders, they were opposed to the use of religion to undermine the rights of women and children. guaranteed in the Constitution. “Our submission will not support marriages involving minors under the age of 18. Parental consent cannot be condoned as it promotes human trafficking, abduction and gender-based violence,” said Tlalang. The meeting included a panel discussion, which deputy CRL Commission chairwoman Sylvia Phetoe and Moral Regeneration Movement chairman Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa participated in.
