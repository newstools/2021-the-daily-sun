THE Free State High Court in Bethlehem has convicted the national top 50 most-wanted suspect to a double life sentence after evading arrest for over a decade. Thapelo Samuel Mokoena (41) from Makwane village in QwaQwa, who was residing in Carletonville in Gauteng, escaped from police custody 15 years ago. But his escape was brought to a halt when the police pounced on him last year. According to police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele, Mokoena and three other suspects were arrested relating to an incident that happened on 23 August 2004 where Dankbaarheid farm owner Johanna Katherine van Niekerk (79) and her gardener Tololo Elias Tsholo (43) were brutally murdered. The accused also attacked two domestic workers – one was shot and killed while the other was shot on the hip. “Due to the swift reaction by police, the suspects were forced to flee the scene without stealing anything. They were then arrested shortly not far from the farm,” said Makhele. The other three accused were found guilty and sentenced while Mokoena fled from custody in Makwane Police Station on 28 July 2005. He was then listed in the top 50 most-wanted suspects countrywide, and top 30 in the Free State. But on 28 August 2020, Mokoena was rearrested after more than a decade-long search. He was found working at Hlanganani Mine in Driefontein near Carletonville where he was living with his family. He was convicted to two life sentences for two murders and 10 years each for two attempted murders on Wednesday, 2 June. The sentence will run concurrently with two life sentences.
