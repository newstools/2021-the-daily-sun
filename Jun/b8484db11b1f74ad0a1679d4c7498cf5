A MAN who lived completely isolated in the forests with his
dad for 41 years had no idea women existed. Ho Van Lang’s strange story started when he fled civilisation
at the end of the Vietnam War in 1972 when a US bomb killed his mum and two
siblings. Lang, who’s now 46, his brother Tri and his dad relocated
deep in the jungle in the Tay Tra district of Quang Ngai province. The trio lived entirely off the wilderness, eating honey,
fruit and forest creatures, building shelters and fending for themselves. Alvaro Cerezo, a photographer who tracked the family down
back in 2015, said: “They always escaped when they saw people from a distance.” According to the Mirror, when asked if he knew what a female
was, Lang said his father had never explained them to him but he’s since seen
them in the village. His brother described him as a baby in a man’s body. “Lang
doesn’t understand many basic social concepts. Lang has spent his whole life in
the jungle. “If I asked Lang to beat someone, he’d do it severely. He
doesn’t know the difference between good and bad. Lang is just a child. He
doesn’t know anything.”
