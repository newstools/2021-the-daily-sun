ON Wednesday, 9 June, ithwasa Ronnie Mnisi (31) was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Mhala Regional Court for raping a minor. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. The state heard how he raped a nine-year-old child inside an abandoned RDP house in Agincourt in 2019. The victim’s father told the court that the accused had lured two nine-year-old girls by saying he would buy them sweets at a nearby spaza shop. Along the way back home, he made his own way with one child. The other one managed to run home to inform the family, and they started searching for her until they heard the victim screaming in the house. “Upon arrival, we caught the accused red-handed and grabbed him by hand with his trousers still above his knees. The victim told us he had raped her. We rushed her to hospital and doctors confirmed the rape,” said the dad. Public prosecutor Advocate Matome Maake said the accused was not remorseful throughout the trial, and asked the court to give him a harsh sentence. Magistrate Majaji Ngobeni found the accused guilty. “The victim was a minor; a nine-year-old in 2019. This is another form of gender-based violence and femicide. Women and children have a legitimate claim to walk free in the street. So it is in the interest of society for justice to take its course. During the course of the trial you denied all allegations and showed no remorse. So you are sentenced to life imprisonment. And this court orders for your name to be entered into the register for sex offenders.”
