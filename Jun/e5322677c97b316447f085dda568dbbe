When the youth of Soweto took to the streets in 1976 to defy oppressive apartheid laws, shouts of freedom rang loud in kasis across Mzansi. Now, 45 years later, the youth of today have not yet found uhuru. Trapped in a wasted, dead economy that has no jobs for them – and a ruling party that hogs corruption scandal headlines every week – our impressionable youth are easily swept up in dirty politics. Corrupt, destructive leaders use them as fodder for their devious political ends. Today, Soweto should be honouring the bravery of the 1976 youth for the vital role they played in the struggle. Instead, rogue community-based agitators have chosen to incite the youth to join them in formenting their dubious, inward-looking, xenophobic rhetoric. These shameful leaders capitalise on the youth’s restless spirit. As far as they’re concerned, young people are only good for throwing stones and burning tyres. The so-called Operation Dudula, which claims it’s looking out for the interests of local black businesses, should be seen for exactly what it is doing: fuelling xenophobic sentiment and attacks unnecessarily. We shouldn’t forget the dark stain in our recent history when over 60 people were killed in 2008 during xenophobic attacks disguised as clean-up initiatives. These dirty-minded, Mickey Mouse politicians must stop using gullible young people when going about plotting and executing their evil plans. Say no to xenophobia! – Editor
