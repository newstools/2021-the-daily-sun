WILLARD Katsande has taken a swipe at the detractors who predicted gloom for Kaizer Chiefs in the CAF Champions League. For a team with no experience in the continental tournament, Amakhosi have surpassed expectations as they now find themselves in the Champions League final, thanks to their 1-0 aggregate victory over Wydad Athletic. “People were making silly remarks that we drew against lower league teams. But we never focused on that but kept looking forward to where we were going,” said Katsande. “The interesting part is that people never gave us a chance. We carried the underdog tag from day one. After winning the first game away we came home and we were held to a draw by the same opposition. “Since I came to Kaizer Chiefs we have been playing in the Champions League, but we would get knocked out in the first round. But that worked in our favour because we kept on learning. “This season was a turning point in our CAF Champions League campaign.” The underdog tag has served the Soweto giants well so far as they have gone all the way to the final almost unnoticed. It wasn’t until they thumped Simba 4-0 that Champions League fanatics took notice.“We went through the group stages against Wydad, Horoya and Petro Luanda, the teams that have been doing well.” “When we lost 4-0 to Wydad a lot of people thought the team was crumbling. “We felt the pain as we were also not doing well in the league at home. But we kept going until the results came and we progressed to the quarter-final. “The underdog tag never left us we’ve carried it to the semi-finals and managed to get an away 1-0 victory. We managed to keep another clean sheet on Saturday, which has now taken us to the final. “We are the fourth team in the tournament to go to the final without conceding a goal at home.”
