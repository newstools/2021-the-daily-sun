IT WAS a scene of bloody carnage when cops arrived at what appeared to be a hijacking attempt. A motorist and two men allegedly posing as cops died after a shoot out on the R50 Road at Delmas, Mpumalanga, on Saturday 12 June. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a passerby informed authorities about two vehicles and three people, including two suspects who were posing as cops, lying next to the road. Police and medical personnel proceeded to the scene where they found a white Toyota Hilux double cab with a male occupant with gunshot wounds. The vehicles were riddled with bullets. Hlathi said a preliminary investigation suggests that the two men from the VW Polo were trying to hijack the bakkie when a shoot out ensued. “The alleged hijackers were found with police face masks as well as reflector jackets. Two firearms were seized from the scene. “One had the serial numbers filed off. The confiscated firearms, one belonging to the victim and the other to the suspects, will form part of the probe,” he said. “The victim as well as one of the suspects have already been identified. The suspect was previously arrested for crimes related to vehicle hijacking,” said Hlathi. He said several incidents were reported at Delmas cop shop where victims were hijacked and robbed of their vehicles and valuables by suspects who disguised themselves as law enforcement officers, driving vehicles fitted with blue lights. “Some of the suspects have since been arrested and their cases are before the court,” said Hlathi.
