He died at the age of 57, shortly after concluding a church service on Saturday. Hours before his passing, Joshua posted on his Facebook page: “Prophet Racine says: ‘We need to have a greater understanding of God’s ways so you will know that God is aware of your situation. When you know that God is aware of your situation, you will cry no more because there is an unseen hand of God behind every affair of any man or woman of faith’.” Since then his followers and members of the public have taken to social media to send their condolences.
