We live in days where society battles gender-based violence every day. We focus more on the physical aspect when condemning women and child abuse. We downplay emotional abuse, a form of maltreatment most jobless women get from abusive partners. Using emotions to criticise, embarrass, blame or otherwise manipulate your partner is abusive. Making someone feel inferior is emotional abuse. A relationship is emotionally abusive when there’s a consistent pattern of abusive words and bullying. More so when such behaviour wears down a partner’s self-esteem and undermines their mental health. Constantly telling your unemployed partner they’d be starving if it weren’t for you is emotional abuse. Cheating and threatening your partner to leave if they keep on complaining is another form of abuse. If your partner and kids are scared of you, then you’re abusing them. Children freely express their feelings to their fathers when they feel welcomed and loved. Some men use custom and tradition as an excuse to abuse. Men need to wake up to the realities of today’s modern lifestyle. It’s a free country, and women and kids have a right to express their feelings. - Letter by Matome Kubu, Arcadia
