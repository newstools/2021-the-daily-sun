KAIZER Chiefs might be having their worst season in the PSL era, but they remain a big team. This is the view of veteran defensive midfielder, Willard Katsande, who also admitted that the team have not always pulled in the same direction this season. Amakhosi are picking up the pieces as they begin life without coach Gavin Hunt, who was fired last Friday. They will be hoping to get maximum points when they face Golden Arrows at FNB Stadium in their penultimate DStv Premiership fixture this afternoon (3pm). Katsande admitted it had not been a good season, but added: “No matter the situation we are in at the moment, we remain a big team, a team that attracts a huge crowd.” He said they need to end the season in style. “We need to go there and leave everything on the field so that our so-called bad season ends in style, and try to win (the final two games) for our fans, for our chairman and for ourselves. I should have done better but at the same time we need a team to pull in the same direction, which we didn’t do because of some hiccups here and there.” Chiefs hit a new low this season as they continue to set undesired records. They have already lost 10 league games this season, matching their previous worst record set in the 2006-07 and 2008-09 seasons. Another unwanted record will see Amakhosi finish with their lowest points tally in the PSL era. They have only 30 points after 28 matches and can only finish on 36 if they manage to get maximum points from their two remaining matches. However, that means they will not surpass their previous record for the lowest points collected in a single season which was 39 points during the 2018-19 campaign. To make things worse, Chiefs are in danger of missing out on participating in next season’s MTN8 as they are currently 11th. Chiefs end their season when they travel to Mpumalanga to face TS Galaxy on Saturday at Mbombela Stadium (3pm).
