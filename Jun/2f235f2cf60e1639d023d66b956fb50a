FORMER controversial Ukhozi FM DJ Ngizwe Mchunu has vowed that his ancestors would deal with the cops who allegedly harassed and assaulted him. He was left reeling with anger after he was allegedly harassed by cops who also threw away his wife’s ibhayi (ancestral cloth), then poured out her dumplings and meat in Ballito, Durban, on Thursday night. Ngizwe’s wife Lindiwe Khuzwayo is a sangoma, and had just performed a graduation ceremony for her trainee when the incident happened. Ngizwe said he had gone to fetch her in Ballito. “It was around 6.30pm when we were stopped by the police. They searched the car. They then stripped my wife off the ibhayi and threw it away. They also threw out the dumplings and meat that she had brought from the ceremony. We asked them to stop but they just continued. They also beat me up. When they realised that I was taking a video, they jumped into their car and fled,” said Ngizwe. He added that they had to look for the ibhayi because they couldn’t just leave it lying on the road. “We only left dumplings and meat. I’m very angry and my ancestors are angry, too. These cops lack respect and I will teach them a lesson. They don’t know me. They didn’t have the right to strip off my wife’s ibhayi like that,” he said. When Ngizwe spoke to Daily Sun, he said he was at Verulam Police Station to open a case against the cops. He also took his anger to social media and posted the video, where he can be heard telling the cops that he has done nothing and he’s not a criminal. Lindiwe is heard screaming, asking what they have done wrong.
