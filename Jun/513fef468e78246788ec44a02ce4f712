My gift is to help, heal and make people aware of their roots and culture,” said Oratile. She said the journey was difficult, but she stayed strong. Oratile said she was grateful to people from Skeem Saam for supporting her. “It was tough and almost seemed impossible, but I persevered because initiation needs patience. The journey isn’t a walk in the park. I didn’t take a break from Skeem Saam. They supported me from the beginning until I finished. They made it easy for me and I appreciate that a lot,” said Oratile. She said she will officially be working as a sangoma from now on.
