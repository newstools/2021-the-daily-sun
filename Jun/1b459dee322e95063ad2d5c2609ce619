The Road Accident Fund’s money woes can be reduced. Some roads were damaged by severe rainfall last year and government never bothered to fix them. Their condition is appalling and bound to cause crashes. The backlog created by lockdown and the scourge of potholes on roads increased the problems. Only proper road safety will resolve RAF’s continued problems. RAF, according to its latest available annual report, received 113 000 claims but only finalised 28% of those in the year in question. Effective and consistent road safety – not confined only to festive seasons and supported by consistent zero-tolerance law enforcement – must be enforced. It’s costly to fix the roads, but this will also relieve the burden faced by RAF. South Africa’s aging road infrastructure must be fixed before it gets worse. High-quality road infrastructure and safety standards are needed
