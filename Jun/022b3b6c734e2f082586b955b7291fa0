Kaya 959’s decision to cut off one of their shows Late Nights with Big Black has angered fans. They have even started a petition to bring the show back on air. According to the fans of the popular show hosted by seasoned presenter Bondo Ntuli, the management of the station made an unfair decision to can the show from its line-up. “Late Nights has been canned by management without a valid cause. The direction the station wants to take to introduce a talk show without proper market research cannot go unchallenged. As listeners, we were never consulted about this sudden change, and we are the main stakeholders. We want management to reconsider their decision and reinstate Big Black,” the petition’s mission statement reads. The petition, which is gunning for 500 signatures, was started by a listener Bongani Skhosana.

The station roped in season broadcaster Phemelo Motene to host their new late night talk show called Point of View with Phemelo Motene. According to the station, the show will delve into the day’s current affairs, touch on real issues and share expert advice on the audience’s everyday questions. It will be broadcast from 8pm to 10pm from Mondays to Thursdays. The station further announced an extra hour has been added to their hugely popular business and finance show, Kaya Biz, hosted by Gugulethu Mfuphi.
