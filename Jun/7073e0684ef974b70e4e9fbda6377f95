I’ve often
paid attention to car guards in the streets or at the shopping centres. Very rarely
would they take note of a driver parking their car, but they wait until the
driver has to drive off. When a
driver prepares to leave, they’re onto the car like a bad rash. They stand
behind the vehicle and wave their hands to ensure you don’t reverse into
another car. This is
often followed by you tipping them for services rendered. My point is that it’s
always about the reverse and never about the parking. Men, like
many car guards, are often excited by a woman’s behind. A post shared by @butts_and_cameltoes  When she
walks or turns around, they can’t help but perform similar gestures to that of
car guards. So, why are
men drawn to a woman’s bum? According
to the research from the University of Texas in Austin, men are not drawn so
much to the size of the bum but are drawn to the curve and, more specifically,
a spinal curvature that offers the illusion of a shapely butt. A post shared by Big Butts (@asslov.r)  In the
study, approximately 100 men between the ages of 17 and 34 were asked to rate
the attractiveness of images of a woman’s silhouette as she stood sideways. Each image
had been altered so the lower spine curved out at different angles, causing the
woman’s bum to protrude in varying extremes. A post shared by Big Butts (@asslov.r)  What
researchers found overwhelmingly was that men preferred the uber-bendy images
that showed the lower spine curved at a 45-degree angle, from back to buttocks. Furthermore,
The Student Room publication explained that men love women with big bums
because men associate women’s strength and power with a big behind. A post shared by Rwandan Oxygen???
