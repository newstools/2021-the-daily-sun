LIGHTING will strike in the same place twice! This is the warning of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach Dylan Kerr to struggling Chippa United ahead of their crucial penultimate DStv Premiership showdown at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday (5pm). Tshakhuma beat Chippa 1-0 in the Nedbank Cup final at Free State Stadium on 8 May. Now the two sides will clash again in their fight to move away from the relegation zone. But Kerr has vowed that his lads will get three points and add more woes to second bottom Chilli Boys. TTM, with 29 points, are safe from automatic relegation as bottom club Black Leopards have 22 points with two matches to play. However, TTM are still in danger of finishing 15th and having to fight it out in the promotion/relegation play-offs with the sides finishing second and third in the GladAfrica Championship, if they lose against Chippa. But the Chilli Boys are in a more precarious position, sitting on 25 points. It’s win or bust for the Gqeberha-based club. A win for TTM would see them out of danger. “This game is bigger than the Nedbank Cup final as we are fighting to move away from the danger zone,” said Kerr. “We know that they’re coming for three points and revenge, but I don’t see that happening in our backyard. “We have beaten them before and I am positive we can do it again.” Meanwhile, defender Ndivhuwo Ravhuhali will miss this encounter due to suspension. “Ndivhuwo is an important player in the team,” added Kerr. “We will miss his services, but I am sure whoever replaces him will do well.”
