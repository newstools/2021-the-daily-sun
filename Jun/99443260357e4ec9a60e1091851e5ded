OPERATION Okae Molao headed to Zandspruit on Friday, 11 June. Given Mabodze, one of the suspects linked to the killing of eight alleged gang members in the area, has been bust. Cops are now looking for another suspect, Mali Dube.      Police commissioner Lieutenant- General Elias Mawela said the net was closing in and the remaining suspect should reveal himself. Mawela led the operation and was supported by Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko and Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo. He emphasised that the operations were meant to mainly root out lawlessness in the area and restore order. He was happy the operation started on a positive note.  “We had two major road blocks which rooted out drunk drivers and drug dealers. We also had integrated partners like Netcate 911, JMPD, Home Affairs, Fidelity and drones which guided the ground forces,” he said. Mawela said illegal immigrants topped the list of arrests. “It’s clear most of the population in this area is undocumented and are in the country illegally. Our Home Affairs team checked them on the spot and many had to be taken in,” he said. He said illegal shebeens were also shut down. Mazibuko said Honeydew was one of the 30 hot spots contributing to crime statistics. She said the illegal trade in alcohol also contributed to gender-based violence. “After drinking in dodgy spots they beat each other up. “There’s no owner of a decent licenced place that can allow that. “People don’t even comply with Covid-19 regulations and roam the streets at night.”  Makhubo said crime in Honeydew was high and he believed it was caused by overpopulation and congestion. “I’m happy we visited this area. People must know that we’re not going to allow any anarchy and lawlessness. “There’s a lot of illegality in Zandspruit from land grabs, electrical theft to water supply theft,” said Makhubo.
