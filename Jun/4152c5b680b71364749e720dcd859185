A group of Soweto residents took their protest to Eskom headquarters in Sunninghill, Joburg, on Wednesday 9 June. The protest is over ongoing power cuts in the area and extended load shedding. Their leader, Nhlanhla Lux, said they chose to protest in Sunninghill as they wanted to avoid the burning and destroying of infrastructure in Soweto as it inconveniences their own people and local businesses. The group consists of people of all ages, from young people to the elderly with walking sticks. They arrived at Eskom Megawatt Park by bus.

There was a strong police and private security presence in the area. They vowed to protest until Eskom addresses their issues.  Nhlanhla said they have decided to cut the middle man, in the form of councillors, and want to deal with Eskom directly.  This is a developing story!
