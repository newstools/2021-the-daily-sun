FORGE your own path, even if others think it’s a bit cheeky. So says this young baker with a passion for sculpting sexy cakes. My 4-5 cakes are here to stay, says confident Sinazo Mbana! Business is booming after stripper Sinovuyo “Bubbly” Sodela asked her to make a 4-5 birthday cake. The 27-year-old from Mount Croix in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape, runs Geshe Services. She never took baking seriously until level 4 of lockdown.  “I learned about baking from magazines and the internet. I baked for my friends and family on their birthdays,” said Sinazo. “What Bubbly asked me to do sparked a lot of debate in my church. It was the first time I was asked to bake that kind of cake. It wasn’t an easy job. I surprised myself, my fiance and many Facebook users,” she said. “It took me five hours to bake that cake. The most difficult part was the 4-5. I had to make it look real. My boyfriend and friends gave me the thumbs up. They said I perfected it.” Sinazo has three orders right now. “One is from a stripper from the Western Cape. Another woman and her boyfriend want a cake like Bubbly’s,” she said. “Last month alone I did birthday, wedding and anniversary cakes. We run a feeding scheme with the money we generate.” She charges from R480 depending on size. Her friend Simphiwe Mancam said: “It’s wonderful to see people like Sinazo showing creativity. The cake is beautiful and she perfected it. It’s circumcised. We live in a democratic country. Everyone can express themselves with any kind of art.” Her customer Zukiswa Mpela (35) said the cakes give a new dimension to lovers. But a church member said Sinazo’s cakes send the wrong message to kids. Bubbly said: “I do order normal cakes from her, but that one was special.”
