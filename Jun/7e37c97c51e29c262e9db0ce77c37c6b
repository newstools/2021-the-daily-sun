THREE suspects who were arrested for fraud, theft and corruption have been released on bail. Roland Smit (46), Michael Harris (38) and Alice Smit (40) appeared before the Nelspruit Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on Friday, 25 June. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, in 2018, Smit and Harris were employed as managers at Crown National Food Distributors in Nelspruit. They outsourced transportation, against company policy, to other companies. “These transport companies were allegedly paid from the Crown National’s account. It is also reported that the duo would further transfer the money into their personal bank accounts, prejudicing Crown National of an actual loss of about R2 million.” Smit’s wife was the administrator on behalf of these companies, and also allegedly received money into her personal bank account. “The trio was arrested on Friday and released on R10 000 bail each, with stringent conditions. These included attending all court proceedings and not interfering with the investigation and witnesses,” said Sekgotodi. The case was postponed to 20 August for further investigation.
