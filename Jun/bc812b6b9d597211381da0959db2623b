TRADITIONAL medicine works for pregnant women and those trying to conceive. A research study at Walter Sisulu University has discovered that there were no complications experienced by pregnant women using it. The research, led by principal researcher Asavela Kasa under the supervision of Dr Nelly Sharpley, focused mostly on the experiences of women using traditional medicines. “It discovered that most women in rural areas used traditional medicine during their pregnancy because they were living in remote areas and far from healthcare facilities,” Kasa said. “These women use both traditional methods and western medicine when they manage to get access to modern healthcare.” Traditional preparations included umchamo wemfene, which is believed to cleanse the bladder and aloe to cleanse the womb. Isihlambezo is taken in the second trimester of pregnancy until the baby is born. The plant, grown in a glass of water, has to be taken every morning and evening to deliver a healthy baby. Another plant umayime is used by those struggling to fall pregnant.  “The roots and leaves of umayime are saturated and drank with warm water. It is believed to treat infertility,” said Kasa. Kasa added a scientific testing of the noted plants and medicines to investigate their chemical components and safety. “The use of these medicines is common among women aged 25 to 35 who are believed to be persuaded by their families or in-laws to use them.” President of Abathwali Bemithi Traditional Healers Organisation, Gobela Rebone Tshabalala-Moloki said it was impressive to see research of this nature. “I agree with the findings of the research and effectiveness of the traditional medicines,” said Tshabalala-Moloki. “It is cheap and effective. It’s not always necessary to spend a lot on western medication when there are herbs in our back yards to treat these conditions.”
