RAPPER AKA had a tough time on Father’s Day. Taking to his Instagram page, he said he couldn’t imagine the pain of losing a child.

Difficult because as much as I’ve lost you, as a father I can’t even imagine what it feels like to lose a child, especially someone as amazing as you. “This is the last picture I took of you, and this is how I choose to remember you. I pray for your family every single day, as I do for mine. We miss you so much, Anele. So, so much. Everything reminds me of you.” Friends and industry colleagues DJ Tira, Khuli Chana, Simz Ngema, Zakwe and Lulo Cafe comforted him. Lulo wrote: “May God bring peace to you and the family, my brother.” An Instagram user, Relebogile, said: “I can’t imagine losing someone I love.
