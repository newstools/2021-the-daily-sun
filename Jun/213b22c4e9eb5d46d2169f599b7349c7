The 30-year-old was temporarily banned for failing to notify anti-doping authorities of his location in January. The actions went against the anti-doping rules which state that athletes must let authorities know of their current or intended whereabouts so that they can be found. Failure to show or give wrong information three times in a year constitutes a punishable offence.
