Gomora fans were left heartbroken by the death of Langa, played by Siya Xaba. Langa died after a few days in hospital due to smoke inhalation. People were hoping he’d make it out alive but unfortunately he died on the episode on Tuesday, 23 June. He was hospitalised after inhaling smoke from a fire which was started by Gladys, played by Thembi Seete. She set Mam Sonto’s (Connie Chiume) tavern alight, not knowing Langa was inside. Both Gladys and Langa were hospitalised. But Gladys was fine, while Langa had a 50% chance of survival.
