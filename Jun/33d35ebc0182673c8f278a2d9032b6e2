THE police are offering a reward of up to R10 000 for information that could lead to the arrest and successful prosecution of three murder suspects. Cebo Gwala (27), Zisholo Shozi (36) and Khona Buthelezi (38) – along with two other men who’re already in custody – are accused of killing brothers Mthoko (22) and Sandile Ndimande (29) in 2019.
