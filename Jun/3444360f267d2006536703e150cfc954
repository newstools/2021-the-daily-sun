A MAN accused of hacking his dad to death with a panga is expected to appear in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court today. He was charged with murder after he was discharged from hospital on Friday, 25 June. He was rescued from an angry mob by police after the alleged murder happened in Mabarhule Trust, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on the evening of Tuesday, 22 June. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police received information about a man who had allegedly been hacked to death by his own son. “On arrival at the scene, the victim was found lying in a pool of blood with multiple open wounds to his body,” he told Daily Sun. “He was certified dead by paramedics. The motive for the attack is still unknown at this stage. “Some members of the community apprehended the suspect and allegedly assaulted him, an action that’s discouraged by the police, who immediately attended to the scene.” Hlathi said a murder case was opened and the suspect was taken to hospital. “We want to warn members of the public not to take the law into their own hands,” he said.
