HE is 36 and has a whopping eight league titles. But Hlompho Kekana is not done yet. “I want to break the stereotype that once you reach 31, you are considered a madala,” said Kekana. “I know what it means to footballers whose careers are cut short because of age. When I look overseas some players play until they are 40. “But here at home, it is sad to see players being overlooked due to age. “I still need to put in a lot of work in order for it to me to achieve what I want to achieve. But I’m ready for the challenge and I’m ready to make sure I keep breaking the boundaries.” But how will the midfield anchor achieve his goal sitting on the bench? Kekana made a mere 15 appearances in competitions last season, including the Caf Champions League. His influence has waned under the current coaches and it will get even tougher next season, with the arrival of new signings. But he is undaunted. “I will continue to fight for my place in the team. I am still far from retirement. I hope next season I can play more and contribute to the team,” Kekana said. “It’s an honour for me to be the captain of an institution like Mamelodi Sundowns and to have lifted the trophy once again. I’ve been with the club for 10 years now and I couldn’t have dreamt that we would be this successful.” When quizzed on the future of Kekana, co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi said: “It’s true that he (Kekana) has not played many games, but we must also look at those who played – what did they do for the club, because at times we dwell too much on him not having played many matches. “We don’t focus on how good those were that got the chance to play, while the truth of the matter is at Sundowns it’s not easy for everyone.”
