SINCE the Covid-19 pandemic hit our shores, South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) social grant programmes have been hit by different kinds of scammers. Sassa national spokesman Mapaseka Letsatsi told Daily Sun that the agency was recently alerted to a new modus operandi that was used to scam and defraud beneficiaries. “The scammers claim to be Sassa employees who move around in communities with skimming devices to defraud beneficiaries of their social grant money. The fraudsters approach beneficiaries and convince them to ‘check’ if their cards are still valid by swiping them through a device. By so doing, the scammers then skim the beneficiaries of their card to clone them later. This then gives the scammers time to load the beneficiary’s information onto a new card and withdraw money,” Letsatsi said. “Sassa would like to warn all beneficiaries to be alert and not cooperate with anyone requesting their cards in the street or at home for whatever reason. Sassa does not send staff to people’s homes to tamper with their cards,” he added. Letsatsi requested public members to report these incidents to the police and contact Sassa on 0800 60 10 11 or social media. Sassa CEO Totsie Memela cautioned social grant beneficiaries. “A report has been found that scammers follow beneficiaries who have recently been paid, especially in the Eastern Cape, North West and KZN. We don’t know as yet if they also ask them to enter their PIN. But in such cases, beneficiaries are advised to never reveal their PIN,” said Memela.
