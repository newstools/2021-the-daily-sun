MEDIA personality Andile Gaelesiwe has penned her first book titled Andile Gaelesiwe: Remembering. Andile, who presents Khumbul’ekhaya on SABC1, said the book is about her life. “The basis of the book is about my experiences with sexual violence and how I healed and responded to life after the ordeal,” she said. “It touches on various parts of my life, my career, music, family and television.” She said a publisher approached her at the end of 2019 with an idea for the book, but she turned them down. “I knew I’d have to go back to some dark places in my life, which I didn’t want to revisit at the time,” she said. “The process of writing the book was the most cathartic experience of my life. I’m glad I finally agreed to the idea of the book as it was the final part of my healing. I feel like a heavy burden has been lifted off my shoulders and my life is just beginning.” ALSO READ |  MAMPINTSHA SPOTTING A NEW LOOK! Andile, who was raped by a relative when she was 11, said she’s healed. “I worked a lot on myself and making peace with my past. This book is a testament to that,” she said. “I’ve also forgiven my perpetrator. Had I not done that, I would not have done the work I do with sexual violence victims.” She said she’d release a second book soon after this one. “Although I love writing, I honestly never thought I’d one day be an author,” she said. “After I finished this particular book, I kept remembering things I’ve not touched on and this is why I decided to release a second book. “The first book isn’t the entire story, but is a story that needed to come out now and people are going to get my full life’s story.”
