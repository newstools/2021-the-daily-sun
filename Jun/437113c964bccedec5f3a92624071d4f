TWO cops from the Roedtan Police Station in Limpopo have been praised for going beyond their duties and helping a young mother give birth. Sergeant Nkang Mogoru and Constable Solomon Mnisi took it upon themselves when the mum arrived at their station complaining of severe pains on Sunday, 6 June. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said it was pleasing to see men and women in blue giving their all to the community. Ngoepe said: “Constable Mnisi was on duty when the young woman arrived and contacted Sergeant Mogoru, who was on patrol duty and quickly rushed back to the station. “The duo collaborated to assist the woman in giving birth in the boardroom of the station. The police at the same time called an ambulance which immediately came and transported the newborn baby and her mother to the hospital,” Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said Mogoru indicated that she understood the risks involved in all these incidents, but that they were often faced with situations where they have to perform duties beyond the normal police mandate in order to save lives. During these incidents, she uses her own emergency kit and resources.
