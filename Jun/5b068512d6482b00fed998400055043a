STELLENBOSCH Municipality sitting deputy mayor has appeared in court after he was bust in connection with the murder of Cameron Mcako. At the time of his death Mcako, who was shot at his tavern in November 2019, was the deputy mayor – the position the accused is currently holding. Nyaniso Jindela (56) and his wife Unathi (46) appeared in the Stellenbosch Magistrates Court where they were each granted bail of R5 000. NPA spokesman in the Western Cape Eric Ntabazalila said the couple face charges including murder and attempted murder. “They are charged with murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, illegal possession of a firearm and illegal possession of ammunition. They were each released on R5 000 bail with strict conditions, including house arrest for all the accused. The house arrest gets suspended only when they have to get medical attention,” said Ntabazalila. The case has been transferred to Western Cape High Court where the couple will join Phumlani Sibongo on 11 June for a pre-trial on the same charges. Sibongo has already appeared on pre-trial on the charges. Their co-accused Gladstone Relegu also appeared together with the Jindelas. Western Cape police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut said the arrest of Jindela came after a relentless pursuit by detectives. He said the killing of Mcako is believed to be politically motivated. “Mcako was shot and wounded at his Kayamandi tavern on 1 November in 2019 and died two days later in hospital. The thorough investigation led detectives to a husband and wife aged 56 and 46 and a third male suspect aged 48. Police management in the province congratulated the detectives for their diligence in pursuing the case so that the perpetrators can see their day in a court,” said Traut. DA leader in the Western Cape Albert Fritz said they are aware of the developments regarding the arrest of Jindela. He said his arrest would not affect service delivery in the municipality.
