The fear of snakes is one of the most common phobias, even though some people have never seen a snake in person. Research has found that humans are naturally afraid of snakes. However, scientists have found that babies are very good at detecting snakes but have a strong tendency to become afraid of snakes from just looking at photos of them. A man posted photos of snakes on social media wearing what he labelled as sweaters in different colours, saying he sold them. “Snake sweater available. Serious buyers should DM or call me, different sizes and colours, free delivery,” he wrote. The SunTeam asked readers how they felt about having a snake as a pet and Ntshuxiey N’wa-Mhlengwe said: “This has something to do with money. I don’t think it’s a pet. Who on earth can make a snake a pet? Yhoo… even me I can’t risk that. It will swallow you alive.”  Itumeleng Hlalele said: “Even if it’s said having it is the only way to the soft life, I’d stay in hardships.” Syanda Khumalo said: “A snake in a sofa warm and cosy, while a person’s under the bridge freezing.” Hlekani Makhubele said: “The snake belongs in the jungle, emgodini...finish.”  Dorcas Pheladi MaMotheo said: “Bathong, a snake wearing a red jacket, anyway it’s winter. I don’t blame the owner.” Mthokozisi Zulu: “Nka screamer gore!” Mbanjwa Mfamalahle Estimela Sinqobile: “Where I come from no person can keep a snake pet. Their house would be burnt to ashes.”
