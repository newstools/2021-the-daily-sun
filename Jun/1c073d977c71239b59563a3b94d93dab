AS the domestic seasons has finally ended, clubs are beginning to reshape their squads. With the aim of returning to the DStv Premiership for the 2022-23 season, Cape Town Spurs are wasting no time and have started preparing. The Ikamva-based club survived relegation to ABC Motsepe League by a whisker last campaign as they finished in position 14 with 33 points after 30 games. Undoubtedly, this season, which will be their fourth season in the First Division, they would want to do better judging by the moves they are making, as SunSport has learnt that the club is in negotiations with Dylan Kerr. Kerr, who recently led Tsakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) to Nedbank Cup triumph and helped the club survived relegation, will be out of contract at the end of this month. He had joined TTM on a short -term deal midseason, which will lapse in two weeks’ time. A source told SunSport that the coach is considering a move to Cape Town. “He (Kerr) has received an good offer from GladAfrica side, Spurs and he is considering it. After nearly being relegated, the club is looking for a coach who’ll be able to hit the ground running with the current youthful squad,” said the source. When contacted for comment yesterday, Kerr told SunSport hat he didn’t receive Spurs’ offer. He stated: “Honestly, those are just rumours. I did not receive an offer. However, I was asked by my agent if I would be interested to coach in the GladAfrica Championship. At the moment, I am still going to meet my chairman (TTM chairman Abram Sello) and discuss the next plans.” Spurs ended the campaign under the watchful eye of Dylan Deane and former Bafana Bafana defender, Nasief Morris. According to the club representative, Shooz Mekuto, there would be few changes, but not in the technical team.
