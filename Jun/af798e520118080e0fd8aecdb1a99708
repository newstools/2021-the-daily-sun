FORMER Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Brian Baloyi has warned Bruce Bvuma and his teammates to “keep their cool” and forget about their result against Wydad Athletic in the first leg of their Caf Champions League semi-final. The Glamour Boys, inspired by a heroic performance by goalie Bvuma, stunned the Moroccan giants 1-0 in their backyard in the first leg last week – setting up the return leg nicely on home soil. Bvuma was a marvel to watch as he pulled off some stunning saves and commanded his backline with impressive authority and conviction as Chiefs put on a solid performance away from home. But Baloyi, who was Chiefs’ goalkeeper when they won the 2001 African Cup Winners Cup, insists that “the job is not done” and has urged Amakhosi to pick up where they left off in the first leg. “It was a brilliant performance in Casablanca from the young man,” said Baloyi, referring to Bvuma’s performance. “He just needs to pick up where he left off. His time will come, or his time is now, it’s up to him to solidify his position. “Getting the team to the CAF Champions League final will pave his future in a big way. “The biggest mistake Bruce and the team can make is to think the job is done. He needs to keep his cool and approach the match as if he’s never played Wydad before and forget about the last game. “When you have a good game, you must strive to be even better in the next one.” Amakhosi will still be without star man Khama Billiat for the second leg scheduled to take place at FNB Stadium on Saturday (6pm) as he continues to recover from injury. However, the return of Lebogang Manyama will come as a huge boost for Arthur Zwane and Dillon Sheppard as they look to lead Amakhosi to a historic Champions League final. “Lebo should be ready and his availability will be really helpful as we look to plan on how we can punish them (Wydad),” said Zwane. “We have to try and frustrate them and hopefully catch them on the break when they leave spaces.”
