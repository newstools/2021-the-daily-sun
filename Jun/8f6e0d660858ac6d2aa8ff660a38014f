FLOYD Mayweather recently spent R13 million on 10 cars for himself and his entourage. The fleet includes three 2021 Dodge Challengers, two 2021 Dodge Chargers, one Dodge Journey, a 2021 Mercedes-Maybach, a 2021 Mercedes-Benz S560 and two Rolls-Royces for himself. Mayweather fought YouTuber Logan Paul over the weekend and he reportedly got a guaranteed R135 million for the fight. According to Carscoops, the guarantee was before his pay-per-view revenue, of which he was guaranteed 50%, which has led to some estimating his earnings from the fight to be about R1 billion. He reportedly has about 100 cars, including a series of Rolls-Royces alongside four Bugatti Veyrons.
