ATM bombers are a thorn in the side of rural people. This affects desperate people who neither have the time nor the means to withdraw cash elsewhere. ATMs, especially those located in remote areas, are literally under siege. More often than not, by the time police arrive criminals will have carried out their evil crime. That’s because the police service is understaffed and, as a result, criminals in rural areas are having a field day. Banks try by all means to make the lives of rural people bearable. Meanwhile, these callous, ignorant criminals just couldn’t be bothered. - Letter by Nelson Kgatla, Pretoria North
