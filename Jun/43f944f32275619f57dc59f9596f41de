THEY are gatvol of izinyoka illegally connecting to their transformer but they’re scared to take action. Residents of Kopanong in Pienaars-poort, Tshwane, said the problem started in February and was also affecting other areas. They told Daily Sun they were scared of the people connecting to the transformer and were forced to live in darkness because the power thieves threatened to burn their homes. A resident said: “More than 1 000 shacks are getting electricity illegally from our transformers. We pay for electricity, but they get it for free.” The residents said they were pleading with the City of Tshwane to cut down the izinyoka lines. Mavis Mokwena (42) said: “Every 20 minutes, electricity trips in our area and we can never finish cooking. “Our appliances get damaged because of izinyoka. We see small torches in the middle of the night as these people connect illegally. We live in fear because of their threats. They promise to burn down our shacks.” Another resident told the People’s Paper that the illegal connections killed people, chickens and dogs. Artwell Motaung (56) said: “We want izinyoka removed because this is making our lives miserable.” He said people even made illegal connections during the day and were not ashamed to be seen. Tshwane acting chief of staff Jordan Griffiths said: “We advise the residents to report individuals to the police and Tshwane Metro cops. “We regularly remove illegal connections and they can lay an official complaint indicating where the connections are. They can also send pictures to the ward councillor or Metro police commander so an operation can be scheduled.”
