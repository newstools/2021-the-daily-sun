ACTRESS Mampho Brescia is excited about her new role on SABC1 drama series, Family Secrets. She plays the role of Cleo Mokwena previously done by Sonia Mbele. Speaking to Daily Sun, Cleo said she’s enjoying herself even though it took her time to get used to the role. “So far I’ve been enjoying myself paying Cleo, even though she’s a difficult character to execute as there are many layers to her,” she said. “I hope I do her justice, especially because I came on in the second season, taking over from someone else, so it was very important for me that I don’t drop the ball and continue with her momentum.
