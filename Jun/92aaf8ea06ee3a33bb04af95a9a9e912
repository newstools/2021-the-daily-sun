The court case relating to Precious Ramabulana and self-confessed murderer Aubrey Manaka brings back bad memories. It has emerged in court that Manaka actually stabbed her 90 times! Precious died a painful death. He raped her first and thought that wasn’t enough, and that seing her dying would satisfy his demonic mind. Manaka has a pending court case: he allegedly raped a four-year-old. He shows no remorse and I believe he feels proud of his actions. He deserves nothing good after all the pain he inflicted on both families. His actions paint a bad picture of men in communities and in the country as a whole. Because of barbarians such as Manaka, women no longer have trust in men. Our country has been marred by GBV incidents, where women and kids are victims. This one is one of the most cruel I’ve ever heard of. The morons who see us as objects with which to satisfy their bent lust must rot in hell and never see the sunlight again. ) Matlou Malibe Lephalale
