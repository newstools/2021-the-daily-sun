IZANGOMA, gobelas and amathwasa protested outside court yesterday. The protesters picketed outside the Alexandra Magistrates Court in Joburg and told Daily Sun they wanted a gobela, who allegedly raped two amathwasa aged 12 and 15, to be locked away. Sangoma Mamlambo said more amathwasa had since come forward with rape allegations against the man in his 50s. She said such evil people were hurting the image of all traditional healers. The accused, who was arrested on 7 June, was denied bail. His family told Daily Sun  he previously went to jail for nine years. “He was found guilty of raping a girl, a boy and a dog in the early 2000s,” said a family member, who didn’t want to be named. She said when he was released from jail he started working as a sangoma.  “He then started having amathwasa coming over and now the rape allegations have surfaced,” said the family member. On Sunday 6 June, angry community members destroyed the accused’s indumba and said they didn’t want to see him in the area again. Alexandra resident Mbuzo Sokhela said: “The case was postponed to Friday, 18 June. “We’ll be back to protest again, opposing bail. We don’t want monsters in our community.” Another relative of the accused told the SunTeam they were still in shock following the man’s arrest. “After being released on parole, I didn’t think he’d be arrested for something like this again,” said the relative. “I hope he’s not guilty because if he is, it would mean he didn’t learn his lesson in jail.” Sangoma Mahlekehleke told Daily Sun the ancestors were angry as the accused was a disgrace. Captain Mavela Masondo said the gobela appeared in the Alexandra Magistrates Court on Monday, 14 June, on a charge of rape. He was denied bail and will remain in police custody until his next appearance, which is coming up this Friday.
