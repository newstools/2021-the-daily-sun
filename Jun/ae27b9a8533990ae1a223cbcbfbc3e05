MEN in Kenya are complaining that their wives won’t let them poke! This is according to Kenyan publication The Star, which reported that some men from Embu municipal, north east of Nairobi, were expressing their dissatisfaction as they could not lead their families like they used to. The local news outlet also reported that the group was on the receiving end of beatings from wives who were refusing to have sex with their husbands. As a result, married men in Embu stood up against physical abuse within their families and appealed to government for intervention. “Men have been sidelined and we are not important anymore. Women have taken over as we have no power. We cannot report mistreatment to the police and whenever you try fighting back, the police act very harshly,” Joseph Wega told the publication. He said whenever they went to local police stations to report the mistreatment by their spouses, they were ridiculed and dismissed as cowards. Chairman of their self-help group InuaWazee Samuel Muturi said the situation had contributed to frustration among men, resulting in several suicide cases. “We are facing difficult moments in our families; we cannot enjoy marriage. We urge the government to empower men and consider balanced treatment of both men and women in the county,” Muturi said.
