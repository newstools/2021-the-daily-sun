EMOTIONS ran high in the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane on Thursday, 10 June. This as state prosecutor Advocate Trott Mphahlele and NPA Limpopo spokesman Mashu Malabi-Dzangi broke down in tears while Mavis Sitholimela testified during mitigation. Mavis is the aunt to Precious Ramabulana, who was a Capricorn TVET College student. She was allegedly raped and killed by Aubrey Manaka in 2019. During Mavis’ testimony, Mphahlele stopped halfway, bowed his head down as he looked emotional and asked the judge for an adjournment. Mavis told the court Precious was killed while her mother, Peggy, was still mourning her husband’s death and was affected psychologically. She said Precious bought furniture and a TV from her Nsfas monthly stipend. “She was a pillar for her family. When it emerged today that he stabbed her 90 times, we no longer forgive him. He can take his sorry back,” she sobbed. Sharing why he was emotional, Mphahlele said he felt pain as Precious was like a breadwinner in her family. “According to the post-mortem, she was stabbed 90 times. “The accused attacked the deceased and stabbed her. He continued to rape her while she bled and stabbed her again with a seven- star Okapi. “I’ve done horrendous cases before, but never felt this way. I’m actually shocked I reacted that way. When I looked at the court gallery everyone was also emotional.” Judge Francis Kganyago is expected to hand down sentence on Friday, 11 June.
