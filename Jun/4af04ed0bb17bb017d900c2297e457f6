THE South African Football Association (Safa) has endorsed the Pro Beach Soccer League which will take place in Durban. The Pro Beach Soccer SA (PBSSA), officially launched last Friday in collaboration with the eThekwini Municipality, will start in the first week of September. The president and chairman of the league Gordon Masondo said: “These are interesting times for our country and we need to pull together to build a country worth living in. “We must start believing in this dream and have faith, as faith is an ability to see the invisible, believing in the impossible and trusting the unknown.” Masondo, who was the general manager of Mpumalanga Black Aces and the CEO of Golden Arrows, also took the opportunity to thank all the stakeholders who made this project a reality. “We would like to give special gratitude to the following that helped make Pro Beach Soccer League a reality,” he said. “SAFA, in KwaZulu-Natal, has given Pro Beach Soccer an eight-year license to organize the league. The league will play the first two seasons with no promotion and relegation to allow the process of development to produce the competitive Beach Soccer’s first division league in the third year.” Locust, technical sponsor, will cater for all 12 teams. The Sportslink Inc. CEO Michael Krog has also spiritedly expressed his satisfaction on the partnership his company has entered into with PBSSA in this ground-breaking journey for the future of this sport in the country. Krog represents the technical sponsors for the league, which is Locust. “As the technical sponsors, we are grateful to have been afforded this opportunity and we look forward to a long lasting partnership, taking the brand of PRO Beach Soccer League to greater heights,” he said.
