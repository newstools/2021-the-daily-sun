NEWCOMERS JVW seem to be the team most likely to give the juggernaut that is Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies a run for their money in the Super League this season. The rookies have taken the league by storm, keeping the pressure firmly on leaders Sundowns in the first seven matches of the campaign. JVW, founded by Banyana Banyana captain Janine van Wyk, are second in the standings with 16 points, only three behind defending champions Sundowns Ladies who are first. They are determined to end the Brazilian Queens’ dominance in the league, as displayed by their 2-2 draw against the leaders in their top-of-the-table clash last time out. JVW are the only team to have denied Sundowns maximum points this season. Jerry Tshabalala’s Sundownshave beaten every other opponent on their way to the summit of the log as they look to continue their dominance in the league. They won the last edition without a single defeat, and will be hoping to replicate the feat again this season. But JVW have proven that they have serious intentions to challenge for the title. “This is what we look forward to when you come into this league,” said Robyn Moodaly. The Banyana international has been one of the standout players for JVW in their debut campaign alongside the likes of Nompumelelo Nyandeni, Isabella Ludwig and Gabriela Salgado. JVW will be desperate to keep piling the pressure on Sundowns Ladies when they face Bloemfontein Celtic Ladies at Dr Molemela Stadium tomorrow (3pm).
