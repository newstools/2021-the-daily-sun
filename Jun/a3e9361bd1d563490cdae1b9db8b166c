A video of an alleged drunk female cop has been circulating on social media. In the 30-second video the unidentified woman, who’s dressed in tracksuits with an SAPS emblem, is seen struggling to stand on her feet. Voices in the background can be heard instructing the alleged cop who’s on her knees to stand up. “Ndlovu, stand up,” a woman’s voice is heard. Upon standing, she is further instructed to stand on one foot. However, she was unable to do so. She’s then seen walking backwards and ultimately hitting against a table, before falling to the ground. National police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said: “I don’t know the person.” No further comment was provided.
