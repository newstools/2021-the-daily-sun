A season that promised to be the worst, could end up being one of the best in the history of Kaizer Chiefs. This as the Glamour Boys are on the verge of clinching their maiden Caf Champions League title. Amakhosi booked their spot in the final of Africa’s premier club competition after beating Wydad Athletic 1-0 on aggregate. They managed to hold the Moroccan giants to a goalless draw on the night having done half the job away from home a week earlier. Amakhosi grabbed an impressive 1-0 win in Casablanca and only needed to keep a clean sheet to progress. And they seemed determined to do that, replicating the stoic defensive performance that had worked for them away from home. They now head into unfamiliar territory, their first-ever final in the Champions League. They will face either Al Ahly or Esperance, who play in the other semi-final later. Pitso Mosimane’s Red Devils hold a slight advantage having won 1-0 in the first leg. Chiefs came into arguably their biggest match without the hero from their last match against Wydad in goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma. The stopper, who was the man of the match in the first leg, missed out along with striker Leonardo Castro. They were replaced by Daniel Akpeyi and Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, who both put in equally solid performances. Wydad, meanwhile, made one alteration with Simon Msuva coming into the side. But he could not inspire a turnaround, as Chiefs continued to make history in the competition.
