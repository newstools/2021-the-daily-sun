UP-AND-COMING kwaito group The OG’z is accusing Drencko of stealing their song, Abafana Abastout. The group – made up of KB The Suspect, Spuku J, Fire Mlilo and 206 Mapantsula – said Drencko released the song without their consent. KB The Suspect, real name Matthew Ncube, told Daily Sun: “We first met during his performance in our neighbourhood in the East Rand and spoke briefly. A week later he came to our studio uninvited and we started working on music. “We decided to feature him on our song. He apparently transferred the song to a drive, and days later we heard stories that he released a song with the same title. We didn’t take it up with him because we respect him and trusted him,” he said. The musician said problems started when they questioned the mastering of the song, but Drencko blocked their calls and messages. “When we approached him, he ignored us and resorted to being xenophobic. “He called me names because I’m not from around here, which left me very shattered,” he said. KB The Suspect said they plan to take legal action against Drencko.

They have no claim over the song. I’m only willing to compensate the person who created the beat,” he said. Asked about the xenophobia claims, Drencko said they were just bitter. “I only said ‘these Zimbabwean guys claim I stole their song’,” he said. “I never said anything hurtful. I addressed them by their birth country. I don’t understand why they aren’t proud of who they really are.”
