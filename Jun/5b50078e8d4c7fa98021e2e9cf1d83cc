We’Re often told an apple a day keeps the doctor away. This saying was not only an English proverb we learnt from school, but it became the code for healthy living. According to health experts, like an apple a man needs one orgasm a day to keep the prostate cancer away.

According to Dr David Samadi at the David Samadi Prostate Cancer Centre in New York, research shows a link between the benefits of sex and prostate cancer. This research adds to the evidence that ejaculation frequency, not the number of sexual partners, is the key factor in reducing prostate cancer risk. The study was carried out by scientists at the Harvard Medical School as well as the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. What they found was that if a male ejaculates at least once a day, the likelihood of developing prostate cancer is very low. The study showed that the participants who ejaculated more than 21 times a month were at a 22% lower risk of getting the disease.
